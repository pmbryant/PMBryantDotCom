# Archive of Typepad blogs 'B and B' and 'Let Yourself Go'

Both of my pmbryant.typepad.com Typepad blogs 'B and B' (2004-2012) 
and 'Let Yourself Go' (2017-2025) were mirrored to my
local machine (via wget), then massaged a bit by removing all (apparently) spurious
files with special characters, plus fixing 'src' refs to a handful of inline images whose 
links had not been converted to local refs.

The 'downloads' folder contains the image links (larger images opened on separate page) 
that were not downloaded via wget. The page links to those images have been disabled
pending potential further work.
