This is the first such day for Lupino since 2009. TCM normally airs from zero to two Lupino movies per month, with an occasional burst up to four—so 13 on a single day is certainly a treat.</p>

<p>Below are my priority recommendations for those who may not be very familiar with Lupino's films. </p>

<p>All but one of those airing are in the range from good to exceptional. Overall, they illustrate the wide range of character types and genres that Lupino skillfully navigated as an actress. They show her ability to carry a film by force of personality or to be a critical supporting player as necessary. </p>

<p>In describing these films, I may sound like a big Lupino fan—and that's because I am. But I became a fan of Lupino's a few years ago by watching these films (and a number of other great ones not being shown, alas). </p>

<p>I will leave <em>High Sierra</em> (1941) and <em>They Drive by Night</em> (1940) off my ranking. These are probably the most aired and most well-known of Ida Lupino's films by a wide margin. See them if you haven't! But if you miss out, you'll be able to catch them again soon.</p>

<p>My top priority are two films that are aired rarely, but deserve far wider recognition: </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Man I Love</strong> (1947) - A noirish wartime melodrama with music, where Ida Lupino plays a nightclub singer. But she really is portraying a superhero with vulnerabilities—compelled to address the wartime homefront problems of her family and friends while encountering her own. This is a signature Lupino performance. Directed by Raoul Walsh.</li>
<li><strong>The Hard Way</strong> (1943) - Another memorable role and dynamic performance from Lupino—but completely different from <em>The Man I Love</em>. Here she plays an aggressive, unethical promoter for singing-and-dancing younger sister, played by Joan Leslie. Lupino was awarded the Best Actress of 1943 from the New York Film Critics Circle for this movie. Directed by Vincent Sherman.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just below the top tier are these, two excellent noirish melodramas and one that stands alone.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Deep Valley</strong> (1947) - Co-starring Dane Clark. A subdued Lupino role, yet she still carries the film from beginning to end. Directed by the under-appreciated Jean Negulesco.</li>
<li><strong>On Dangerous Ground</strong> (1951) - Co-starring Robert Ryan. Lupino made this while in the midst of her run as an independent writer-producer-director from 1949 to 1954. Directed by Nicholas Ray. </li>
<li><strong>The Sea Wolf</strong> (1941) - I like to insert this film into conversations about the best films of all time. Lupino has a top supporting role, paired with John Garfield. She certainly contributes her share, but Edward G. Robinson dominates the film—the only reason I don't have this at a higher priority on a day dedicated to Ida Lupino. Directed by Michael Curtiz.</li>
</ul>

<p>Progressing down the list, two more high quality films:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Devotion</strong> (1946) - To best appreciate this film, ignore that this is supposed to be representing the Brontë sisters and instead treat it as a fictional story inspired by them. It is excellent in that regard. This is the film that pushed me over the edge into a superfan of Lupino's. Directed by Curtis Bernhardt.</li>
<li><strong>Pillow to Post</strong> (1945) - For a change of pace, Lupino stars in a screwball comedy! Perhaps not so surprising if you are familiar with her 1930s Hollywood career or her 1950s sitcom <em>Mr. Adams and Eve</em>. Your preferred style of humor will affect how much you enjoy this, but it is very well done. Directed by Vincent Sherman.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now the relatively lower priority films. Still worth seeing if you can!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Out of the Fog</strong> (1941) - Lupino and John Garfield are top billed, but Thomas Mitchell is really the star here, with sidekick John Qualen, and is terrific. TCM has aired this fairly often recently. Directed by Anatole Litvak.</li>
<li><strong>The Big Knife</strong> (1955) - Lupino stars as the estranged wife of a movie star portrayed by Jack Palance, in this ensemble picture based on a Clifford Odets play. John Garfield was a major inspiration for the Palance character and had originated the role on the stage. Garfield, a close fiend of Lupino's, had tragically died a couple years before this film was produced. Directed by Robert Aldrich.</li>
<li><strong>Escape Me Never</strong> (1947) - Like <em>Devotion</em>, this film is better than its reputation. While the least memorable of Lupino's great run of pictures in the 1940s, I think it has gotten a bad rap over the years in part because Errol Flynn fans were disappointed that this is not a high-energy action film, but instead a woman's picture. Lupino and Flynn were great friends and their chemistry here is through the roof. Directed by Peter Godfrey.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the lowest priority film by my ranking:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>While the City Sleeps</strong> (1956) - I have this at the bottom for two reasons: first, it is just an okay film; second, TCM airs it fairly often. It is unusual in that it is an ensemble film with <em>ten</em> stars. So Lupino has relatively little screen time. What she has is delicious, however—and unlike any other Lupino role you'll see on this day. Directed by Fritz Lang.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before concluding this, I have to plug some of my favorite Lupino films that are rarely or never shown on TCM, because they are from studios outside the TCM library. In particular, <em>Ladies in Retirement</em> (Columbia, 1941), <em>Moontide</em> (20th Century-Fox, 1942), and <em>Road House</em> (20th Century-Fox, 1948). These belong in the top tier of recommendations. Seeking them out will be rewarding.</p>

<p>Please also peruse my writings on Ida Lupino here at this blog. I have devoted substantial time and energy to studying her life and career over the last few years and believe I have come up with some interesting and original articles. Here are couple related to the films being aired by TCM:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/letyourselfgo/2020/11/ida-lupino-almost-lost-first-starring-vehic.html">How Did Ida Lupino Almost Lose Her First Warners Starring Vehicle To Bette Davis?</a> (<em>The Hard Way</em>)</li>
<li><a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/letyourselfgo/2021/10/lupino-bogart-feud.html">Making Sense of the Lupino-Bogart feud</a> (<em>High Sierra</em> and <em>Out of the Fog</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope others enjoy Ida Lupino's films and would love to hear thoughts on your favorites, least favorites, and so on.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Let's try something fairly straightforward to get this blog back on track. What were my favorite movies that I watched in August that were new to me?</p>

<p>Of the 21 new watches, 6 made the finals, with at least 4 stars in my Letterboxd rating. In the order I watched them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Craig's Wife (1936)</li>
<li>It Should Happen To You (1954)</li>
<li>In the Heat of the Night (1967)</li>
<li>Sherlock, Jr. (1924)</li>
<li>Gold Rush Maisie (1940)</li>
<li>Woman in Hiding (1949)</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom of these is <em>It Should Happen to You</em>, which was fabulous for 80% of the film. Alas, it suffers from a very weak denouement, with Judy Holliday's character suddenly throwing away her ambition and uniqueness to fall into a routine romantic ending.</p>

<p>Moving up, next is <em>Craig's Wife</em>, starring Rosalind Russell and directed by Dorothy Arzner. This is an excellent film, but does have some relatively  small flaws, including a slow opening and a heavy-handed message.</p>

<p><em>Sherlock, Jr</em> and <em>In the Heat of the Night</em> are next. Both are great watches, albeit extremely different from each other. Neither film entirely suits my tastes, which may explain why I do not rate them even higher.</p>

<p><em>Woman in Hiding</em> is my second favorite new watch of last month. It is a suspenseful, engaging thriller from the opening. And it has the wonderful Ida Lupino in the lead role, which is another huge plus for me.</p>

<p>Finally, my absolute favorite new watch in August was the third film in the Maisie series <em>Gold Rush Maisie</em>. I had watched the first two Maisie movies back-to-back well over a year ago. The original, <em>Maisie</em>, was fabulous. The second, <em>Congo Maisie</em>, was entertaining, but didn't inspire me to move on to the others. That was a mistake, as the third film is the best yet and  hooked me on Ann Sothern's "Maisie" character and how good-hearted and empathetic she is---a super-hero without super-powers. It was heart-breaking to see her drive off alone at the end of the movie, leaving her new friends, setting off on her next adventure.</p>

&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a tremendous run of successful roles at Warner Bros. in 1940-41, Ida Lupino starred in &lt;em&gt;Ladies in Retirement&lt;/em&gt; (1941) for Columbia—-opposite her then-husband Louis Hayward. This is an excellent, tense thriller that deserves more attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lead role in the original hit play was played to great acclaim by Flora Robson and meant for a woman of sixty. Director Charles Vidor imagined the film character to be forty. Ida was 23 and an eight-year veteran of motion pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Columbia mogul Harry Cohn exclaimed to the producer, “You are out of your mind choosing this child to play that role.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As William Donati writes in his bio of Lupino: “Ida&#39;s performance was one of her greatest. Her restraint as the cold-blooded Ellen made her all the more frightening.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Road House (1948). Ida Lupino had recently left Warner Bros. after refusing to sign a long-term contract that did not allow for outside work. During her new free-lance period, she found the story that led to the film &quot;Road House&quot;, and had her agent sell the project to 20th Century Fox on the condition that she star in the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a great, dramatic thriller, where Ida plays a nightclub singer. She does her own singing in this film, and, as Celeste Holm&#39;s character says, &quot;She does more without a voice than anyone I&#39;ve ever heard.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was one of the first Ida Lupino films I watched, and it still is one of my favorites, which is a very high standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s one of very few films done in Hollywood by French superstar Jean Gabin. The dark, foggy, isolated atmosphere is reminiscent of film noir. But this film is really unique.&lt;/p&gt;

Ida Lupino gives a powerful performance as Charlotte Brontë, author of Wuthering Heights. Arthur Kennedy is very memorable as her troubled brother. Paul Henreid and Olivia de Havilland also star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie was filmed in 1943 but held for release for over two years. It doesn’t appear to have been well-received critically, partially because of how it deviates from historical accuracy. But I found it a very well-done, memorable film. Ida was especially impressive to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

Even amongst Ida Lupino films, it seems obscure, despite being a major production by Warner Bros. at the height of her acting career and directed by a well-regarded director, Vincent Sherman.</p>

<p>Fortunately <em>In Our Time</em> is now available on DVD thanks to <a href="https://www.wbshop.com/products/in-our-time-1944-mod">Warner Archive</a>--released in mid-2016. Before that, as I learned from re-listening to the <a href="http://warnerarchive.tumblr.com/post/147603694566/cyd-and-the-zombie-salivation-army-warner-archive">Warner Archive podcast</a> episode from its DVD release, it had never been available on home video. This film's availability is welcome news because <em>In Our Time</em> does not deserve to be obscure.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino plays a young Englishwoman employed by a wealthy antique dealer, portrayed by Mary Boland. They are traveling to Warsaw in early 1939 in pursuit of Polish antiques. While there she meets a Polish aristocrat, played by Paul Henreid. The story of their courtship, her travails in meeting his tradition-bound family, and her uncertainty about her decision to marry him, is compelling and very charmingly performed. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2022ad3b943ce200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2022ad3b943ce200b img-responsive" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Iot2" title="Iot2" src="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2022ad3b943ce200b-300wi" /></a>Lately, I cannot get enough of Ida Lupino's acting. Her character here is very different from the intense, troubled characters for which she is best known. Rather, here she plays a reserved, thoughtful, and psychologically well-grounded woman. This is not something I even realized until afterwards, as she fit into the role so naturally.</p>

<p>The explicit mention of the early 1939 date lends an ominous underpinning to the romance between Lupino and Henreid, as the 1944 audience knew what lay ahead for Poland in just a few months. These days fewer may understand the timing: Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, triggering World War II.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="http://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2022ad3738c9a200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2022ad3738c9a200c img-responsive" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Iot3" title="Iot3" src="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2022ad3738c9a200c-300wi" /></a><em>In Our Time</em> was filmed in mid-1943 and released in early 1944, during the height of World War II. This story about a few people caught up at the very beginning of the war was thus only a few years old, with an outcome still uncertain. Knowing this lends extra poignancy to the final scenes, which may otherwise come across as heavy-handed propaganda.</p>

<p>My impression after watching <em>In Our Time</em> for the first time over the last couple nights is that it is an excellent character-driven romance for the first two-thirds; then in the last third, the characters are swamped by the larger forces at work. This may well have been how it felt to be alive during this period, when personal concerns could be rendered moot due to the necessity felt by many to fight in the service of a larger cause. I grew to care about Lupino and Henreid's characters, and would have liked to have seen how their story could have played out without Nazi interference. Alas, the war interfered in countless people's lives in horrific ways and cannot be wished away.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino is not in this film as actress, and certainly not as director, so why did this film become a priority? Because Ida is in the second film of this series, <em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em>, also from 1939, and I am strangely insistent on watching serials in the proper order if I can. That may be a bit over-the-top since most of these old serials don't have an ongoing story line between films, but I still prefer it that way.</p>

<p>Anyway, this film has Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, so it can't be bad, can it? Indeed, it was quite enjoyable.</p>

<p>Particularly stunning was the dark, misty, expansive set of the foreboding moor terrain, where much of the action is set. The lack of any background music was also particularly noticeable, and I think, made the scenes of the moor all the more effective.</p>

We selected a 1943 Lana Turner comedy on FilmStruck, &lt;em&gt;Slightly Dangerous&lt;/em&gt;, despite knowing absolutely nothing else about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be a surprisingly excellent choice. I should not be so surprised, though, as I&#39;ve enjoyed Lana Turner in other light comedy roles in her early films. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is a superb cast supporting her, with Robert Young, Walter Brennan, and May Whitty, Lana carries this film and does so smoothly at it that I wish she had been able to continue doing comedies longer into her career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoilers below&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also applaud the writers for not taking a cheap way out that I thought they were going to take mid-way through the film, and that I&#39;ve seen less sophisticated movies take. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For background, early in the film, one of Lana&#39;s character&#39;s complaints is that she has no family. Later, after she has schemed to pose as the long-lost amnesiac missing daughter of rich businessman Walter Brennan, and Brennan discovers her real name from Robert Young, Brennan suggests that just because her name had been different didn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t really his missing daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, I suspected the writers were going to make Lana turn out to be the real missing daughter in the end, as such a contrivance would diminish the impact of her deception on the well-meaning Brennan character. Certainly plenty of lesser comedies, especially more modern ones, have taken similar artificial turns to make their scheming characters more sympathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the writers did not take that turn that they were cleverly setting up, and instead went down a far more touching and believable path, giving some genuine emotional weight to the film&#39;s finale.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>We just stumbled across the film The Animal Kingdom, an RKO film from 1932, and very much enjoyed it. It is definitely pre-code, as the plot involves sex and co-habitation outside of marriage and other subjects that would soon be taboo in Hollywood films. Because of that, the film does feel quite unusual for the era.</p>
<p>This was my first significant exposure to both Leslie Howard and Ann Harding. Harding's role is surprisingly small given her top billing. Myrna Loy actually is the female lead and she is extremely impressive. This was apparently a critical role in launching her to stardom. Leslie Howard is great as well.</p>
