<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>A few weeks back, <a href="https://brightlightsfilm.com/claudette-colbert-director/">Bright Lights Film Journal</a> published an article of mine—the first of my writings on classic Hollywood that I have published elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Claudette Colbert, Director?</strong><br/>
    <em>The untold story of how the screen comedy queen of the 1930s and ‘40s nearly become one of very few women to direct feature films in postwar Hollywood.</em>

<p>Please follow the link to <a href="https://brightlightsfilm.com/claudette-colbert-director/">Bright Lights Film Journal</a> and read the article. </p>

<p>It was inspired when I ran across the 1949 headline below several years ago—only to find out that I could not read the full story behind this Louella Parsons item because no one had written it! Eventually I decided to do it myself. I hope you enjoy it. </p>

<p>Please let me know your thoughts, either in a comment here or at Bright Lights Film Journal or at my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pmbryant.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> account.</p>
