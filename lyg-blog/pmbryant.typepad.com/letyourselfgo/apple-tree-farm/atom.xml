<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>This is the story of a non-legendary chapter in a legendary career—the story of Ida Lupino's first attempt to become a film producer in Hollywood. It was a frustrating experience that set the stage for her later triumphs.</p>

<p>The legendary part of Lupino's story is that, in 1949, she left her career as an established Hollywood movie star to become the driving force behind an independent production company—eventually known as "The Filmakers". There, with collaborators Collier Young and Malvin Wald, she wrote, produced, and directed low-budget films, initially starring unknown actors, that told stories the major studios of the time were not addressing. </p>

<p>Less known is that Lupino's first attempt to move behind-the-scenes into film production came two years earlier. This chapter of the Lupino story is typically ignored in overviews of her career. Even the comprehensive biography by William Donati devotes only a single paragraph to it.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98cc1ee200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98cc1ee200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino portrait, circa 1945" title="Ida Lupino portrait, circa 1945" src="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98cc1ee200b-250wi" /></a>For this initial effort as producer, her approach was very different from her later one. Her goal was to produce films at the same level as the major studios with herself as the star—continuing her acting career, but with creative control. After many months of hard work through most of 1947, she was left with no visible accomplishments. Yet it is likely that from this discouraging episode, she learned lessons that helped make her later creative efforts successful—and that immortalized her career.</p>

<p>To set the stage, let's begin a couple years earlier—January 1945. The end of the all-consuming war was in sight, Lupino's six-year marriage had recently broken up, and Lupino was emerging from that emotional trauma contemplating her life. </p>

<p>At the age of 27, Lupino claimed she was "flummoxed" about her career and seriously considering a major change. At the time, she was a Hollywood veteran of over a decade, at the height of her fame, with a stellar reputation as one of the top dramatic actresses in the industry. But, as she told columnist Erskine Johnson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I'll go berserk if I'm still dashing around at 30 [getting up at 5 o'clock every morning making myself look beautiful and then rushing to the studio]. 
  I have a time now making myself look good—and I've got a voice like Wallace Beery's."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She had long known that her time at the top would be limited, and that she needed alternatives in order to survive in Hollywood when her leading actress days were over. Her present plan was to give up acting and become a full-time writer.</p>

<p>Her acting contract with Warner Brothers still had two more years to go. Over those two years, she used her down time to sample various plans for the next phase of her career. She worked on several screenplays, often in collaboration with others—notably her ex-husband, actor Louis Hayward, and actress Barbara Read. In early 1946, Lupino sold one of her screenplays to RKO—<em>Miss Pennington</em>—for $20,000.</p>

<p>Music was another major effort, building on what had been a passion of hers for years. She wrote numerous songs, by herself and in collaboration with Nick Arden and William MacIlwinen. In the spring of 1946, she and MacIlwinen undertook to get a musical stage show produced on Broadway. Lupino took a three-month leave-of-absence from her Warners contract to push this project to completion. Unfortunately, it did not come to fruition as a Broadway show; however, it was eventually produced at a smaller venue in 1949. (See this <a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/letyourselfgo/2020/05/ida-lupinos-apple-tree-farm.html">earlier article</a> for more on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>.)</p>

<p>Another approach was to continue acting, but to produce her own films. For Lupino, who had been battling studio executives for years over scripts, the lure of creative freedom beckoned. Initially she contemplated a co-producing-acting partnership with ex-husband Hayward, with whom she remained friendly and who also had self-producing ambitions. </p>

<p>But she went a different route. Enter independent producer Benedict Bogeaus. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202788011e862200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202788011e862200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Producer Benedict Bogeaus with wife, actress Dolores Moran, circa 1950s" title="Producer Benedict Bogeaus with wife, actress Dolores Moran, circa 1950s" src="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202788011e862200d-250wi" /></a>Ben Bogeaus was a businessman who had made a lot of money in the early years of the war, and then, in 1944, moved to Hollywood to produce films. Bogeaus' movies had name stars and respectable budgets. His company had already released three films by the end of 1945, and his ambitions were expanding. In January 1946, Lupino—with a year left on her Warners contract—signed on to star in one of Bogeaus' pictures. Initially there was no mention of her producing.</p>

<p>At this same time, Lupino claimed that she would be willing to extend her time with Warners <em>if</em> they let her pick stories and directors. While Warners likely would never cede so much control, this indicates Lupino's producing ambition had solidified. In March, 1946, it became explicit. Lupino told Hedda Hopper, "I'd like to get into writing and producing. Acting is too tortuous."</p>

<p>As the Broadway hopes for her stage show slipped away, her next Warner Brothers film suffered delays, and the one with Bogeaus was on hold, Lupino continued her writing work on music and screenplays, while also enjoying a newfound passion for sailing.</p>

<p>Late in 1946, she revealed to the press that one of the sticking points in her negotiations with Warner Brothers was that she wanted the right to independently produce one picture a year—"<em>which I've already contracted to do</em>" (emphasis added). This is the first sign I have found that her deal with Bogeaus had extended from acting into producing. She also said that she was comparing notes on the challenges of being a producer with friend and fellow actor-turned-producer John Garfield.</p>

<p>Lupino left her longtime studio in early 1947, refusing to sign the long-term exclusive contract Warners insisted on. Within days of completing her last film at Warners, <em>Deep Valley</em>, Lupino, along with Bogeaus, announced the formation of a new company to house their joint effort—a company separate from Bogeaus' own. Louella Parsons wrote on Feb. 5, 1947:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those swanky new offices being redecorated on the Ben Bogeaus lot are for Ida Lupino, who moves over to General Service Studio [Bogeaus' lot at the time] as a producer as well as star.</p>
  
  <p>She and Ben have formed the Arcadia Productions, with Ida set for one film a year for the next three years. </p>
  
  <p>Ida's first is a comedy, "New Year's Eve", an original story by Norman Reilly Raine. 
  Ida plays an heiress who gets kidnaped on New Year's Eve by a prize fighter and a G.I. and the complications that ensue can be imagined. </p>
  
  <p>I'll say for Bogeaus that he tries to keep his stars happy by letting them have their say about their movies. Gregory Peck has a "piece" of "Macomber Affair" 
  and Burgess Meredith is co-producer of "A Miracle Can Happen" and several other pictures he's made with Ben.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over much of the succeeding year, Ida Lupino would devote her prodigious energies to her new role as producer of her own films. We will see how that turned out in the next edition.</p>

William MacIlwinen in early 1945. </p>

<p>Who is MacIlwinen, or—as the newspaper caption erroneously spells it—"Macwillinen"? </p>

<p>MacIlwinen is the fellow that Miss Lupino teamed with in early 1946, roughly a year after this photo was published, to write the score for her musical adaptation of her deceased father's stage comedy <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. For the dozen-plus songs they wrote for this show, MacIlwinen wrote the tunes while Ida contributed the lyrics.</p>

<p>Long-time readers may remember my "discovery", back in May, that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> had not gone unproduced—as I had assumed based on other readings. In fact, it had been produced in 1949 at the University of North Carolina.</p>

<p>If you don't remember or aren't a long-time reader, please be sure to go back and read about it here: "<a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/letyourselfgo/2020/05/ida-lupinos-apple-tree-farm.html">Ida Lupino's Apple Tree Farm</a>". I think it is quite a story!</p>

<p>For Ida Lupino, music and songwriting were, for many years, one of her primary interests outside of her career in films. So, of course, she had other musical collaborators besides Lt. MacIlwinen. But I do believe she only had one musical comedy stage show produced. And so MacIlwinen should hold special prominence in accounts of Miss Lupino's musical accomplishments, and finding photographs of the two of them together is a special occasion.</p>

<p>The photo caption says, by the way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LEARNING 'LESSON' — The three R's now include "rhumba" 
  when Ida Lupino dances with Lt. William Macwillinen, 
  a former North Carolina school teacher. 
  Lt. Macwillinen also is a songwriter and Ida helps him with his work,
  when he needs her assistance.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Recently I uncovered some fascinating information on a forgotten aspect of Ida Lupino's multi-faceted career. Aside from her well-known contributions as a film and television actor, writer, producer, and director, she also co-authored a musical comedy that was <em>produced on stage</em> in 1949. </p>

<p>The stage production was the revelation, since it appears to have gone down a memory black hole. I have not seen such a production mentioned in any of the books and articles I have read about Ida over the last few years, even those by her biographers.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino had serious ambitions to write and produce a stage musical comedy, and she had worked quite a bit in that direction in the 1930s and '40s in her spare time. So it is pleasing to discover that this ambition of hers was realized, adding another item to long list of her show business accomplishments.</p>

<p>My presumption that none of Ida's stage musical works had been produced was based in part on <a href="https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/03/27/apple-tree-farm-a-script-by-stanley-lupino-with-revisions-by-ida-lupino/">a 2014 article</a> by MoMA associate curator Anne Morra — an informative article about a script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> that MoMA had recently acquired. At the end, Morra relates that "<em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was never realized as a stage or screen musical". </p>

<p>From my own readings, I knew <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was the play that Ida was most determined to see produced. She had taken time off from acting and spent several months of 1946 — near the height of her Hollywood stardom — with the lofty ambition of getting it to Broadway. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-classic-hollywood-lupino-centennial-20180216-story.html" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20264e2dd9ce3200d img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Stanley and Ida Lupino in 1935 (LA Times)" title="Stanley and Ida Lupino in 1935 (LA Times)" src="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20264e2dd9ce3200d-450wi" /></a>This play was something she clearly cared deeply about. Ida's late father Stanley had written the original book, and there was no one Ida was more determined to please than him. Her attempt to adapt Stanley's book, write a score, and produce the play may have been a way to honor him after his early death in 1942. Morra mentions that Stanley's script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was the only script that Ida retained to the end of her life. </p>

<p>Ida Lupino's push to make <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> a reality on the stage may have begun in 1943, the year after her father's death. Late that year, an item in <em>Photoplay</em> magazine relates, "Ida, by the way, is working hard on that musical comedy (she wrote all the music for it) she expects to stage very soon. Producer Lupino! Not bad." This item is consistent with <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>, though there is a chance it could be something else — she dabbled in music constantly at that time.</p>

<p>Events in Ida's personal life likely distracted her soon after that. Her husband, Louis Hayward, returned from the South Pacific a war hero, but devastated by his experiences. Helping him recover, then dealing with the break-up of their marriage in subsequent months took virtually all her energy. </p>

<p><em>Apple Tree Farm</em> doesn't re-emerge as a public priority for Ida until she was working on the film <em>Escape Me Never</em> with Errol Flynn in late 1945 and early '46. At that time, she energetically resumed work on the musical comedy. The press reported that she had written music and lyrics for five numbers and was aiming for it to be on Broadway in the fall.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino and Bill MacIlwinen work on Apple Tree Farm (Chicago Tribune, 1948)" title="Ida Lupino and Bill MacIlwinen work on Apple Tree Farm (Chicago Tribune, 1948)" src="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b-450wi" /></a>Around this same time, she had invited several men and women to share her household due to the post-war housing shortage. One of these, a war veteran named Bill MacIlwinen, was a talented musician, and in him, Ida found a willing and able collaborator on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>.</p>

<p>In a March 9 column, Hedda Hopper wrote that Ida was taking a three-month leave-of-absence from making pictures at Warner Bros. in order to work on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. She would "adapt it for American audiences and to collaborate on the score with an ex-soldier". Ida planned to have a cast of "unknowns" and to do a tryout on the west coast before taking it to Broadway. </p>

<p>A week later, another Hollywood columnist said Ida was "working like mad" with Bill MacIlwinen. They were expecting to finish in late April, after which they would go to New York City to sell it to Broadway. Late in March, Louella Parsons wrote that "Warners have taken an option on Ida Lupino's musical, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>, for a movie. It's all ready for its Santa Barbara tryout." </p>

<p>Next, the Hollywood press reported that "Ida has signed radio comedian Jackson McCarthy to play in it," and that she and MacIlwinen had fourteen musical numbers written for the play. Singer Tony Martin was said to be ready to try out a couple of the songs on his radio show. (I would be fascinated to know if this actually happened.)</p>

<p>So as of April 1946, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> appeared to be on track for a production in Santa Barbara in the near future. Ida and Bill were proud of their work, as columnist Erskine Johnson discovered while vising the "Lupino Asylum", as Ida referred to her household, on "a rather dull afternoon", with only 10 or 12 people there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I want you to meet Bill MacIlwinen," Ida said. "He was a lieutenant in the Navy. Now we're collaborating on a Broadway musical — 'Apple Tree Farm'. Bill is writing the music, and I'm writing the lyrics. Listen! — he's playing the piano in the living room now."</p>
  
  <p>We listened. Bill was an excellent pianist.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>"You must hear some of our songs from 'Apple Tree Farm'," Ida said. We all rushed into the living room. Bill played and Ida sang.</p>
  
  <p>"My sister's husband is designing the hats for the show," Ida said, after singing four numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next on the agenda was Ida's New York sales trip, scheduled for May 7.</p>

<p>Then something happened — at the last minute, Ida Lupino postponed her trip. </p>

<p>The reported reason for the cancellation was a "serious throat ailment". Soon,  columnist Edwin Schallert expressed doubt that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> would go further any time soon, as Ida was going to be too busy with film work. One of the films Schallert mentioned for Ida never happened, while the other, <em>Deep Valley</em>, didn't end up going before the cameras for four months.</p>

<p>On June 4, columnist Harrison Carroll reported, "Ida Lupino will do a complete re-write on the book of her musical <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. She plans to publish several songs in the meantime." </p>

<p>At that point, at least in the press, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> goes dark.</p>

<p>Six months later, by which time Ida Lupino was starring in <em>Deep Valley</em>, a United Press article about the madhouse of assorted people at Ida's home quotes her saying she is working on a musical for which "the play was written by my father." Signs of life? Or old news?</p>

<p>Another eighteen months — then, in April 1948, a Chicago Tribune layout on Ida includes an undated photograph of her working with Bill MacIlwinen on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. Again, is this signs of life or an old picture? </p>

<p>By late 1948, Ida had married Collier Young, and her household reverted to that of a traditional couple — no longer a motley assortment of people coming and going. Soon, she and Young would be writing and producing their own movies. The time for a stage production of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> had come and gone — or so I would have thought.</p>

<p>But then, on January 28, 1949, just a few days after Ida announced her plans to produce a film about unwed mothers for her independent company — the film that became <em>Not Wanted</em> and launched her celebrated directing career — an item appears in the Raleigh News and Observer with the headline "Ida Lupino's Play Will Be Presented":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chapel Hill, Jan. 27 — "Apple Tree Farm", an original play by Stanley and Ida Lupino of Hollywood, with music by Bill McIlwinnen [sic] of Fayetteville, will go into production next week on the University of North Carolina campus. </p>
  
  <p>The modern musical fantasy will be given here April 4, 5, 6, under the sponsorship of the Laboratory theatre of the Carolina Playmakers for the benefit of the Koch Memorial Fund.</p>
  
  <p>Martin Jacobs of Greensboro, who staged last year's first Memorial Fund show, "Sweep It Clean," will again be director.</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino, the famous movie star, has indicated she expects to attend the performance in Chapel Hill.</p>

<p>Amazing news!</p>

<p>As I examined the newspaper archives from North Carolina as the April production date approached, I was concerned. Did this actually happen? Did something arise to prevent it?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Apple Tree Farm rehearsal (Daily Tar Heel, Apr 6, 1949)" title="Apple Tree Farm rehearsal (Daily Tar Heel, Apr 6, 1949)" src="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b-450wi" /></a>But nothing got in the way — it actually happened! The original planned run of three nights was extended to five: April 4-8, 1949.</p>

<p>Ida was unable to attend the performance due to her duties on her film, <em>Not Wanted</em>, which now included directing due to the illness of the assigned director, Elmer Clifton. She did do an interview on a CBS coast-to-coast broadcast the day before the premiere in North Carolina. And she and her friend Harry Mines sent telegrams of congratulations to the cast after the first night's performance. The reviews in the local newspapers were disappointed with the book, but enthusiastic about the music and songs. </p>

<p>Ida was not yet done with <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. At the time of the North Carolina production, she was reported to be planning a meeting with 20th Century-Fox about a script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. A few months later, when Ida was acting in the film <em>Woman in Hiding</em>, working with director Michael Gordon, this item appeared in papers: "Miss Lupino owns a property she'd like to see staged, and Gordon, a Broadway veteran, is, she sighs, the man to stage it." What else could that be but <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>? Ida clearly did not relinquish her Broadway dreams easily.</p>

<p>The next month, Ida told a North Carolina reporter that she'd like to visit the state in near future to visit friends, including Bill MacIlwinen. "I'm still quite elated over Bill's and my collaboration on the musical comedy, <em>The Apple Tree Farm,</em> which the Carolina Playmakers produced this spring. Maybe we'll do another."</p>

<p>And then <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> really does go dark — eventually falling into that memory black hole.</p>

<p>Morra's article suggests that Ida worked on a screenplay version in the 1950s. By that point, Ida was heavily into film producing, directing, and writing. As her Broadway initiative kept hitting dead ends, it makes sense that she would decide to produce it herself in the medium she was expert at and had some control over. She had so many other projects going, though, that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> does not seem to have gotten much attention at that point, even from her.</p>

<p>As the years passed, Ida Lupino retained the script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> — alone amongst the numerous ones that she had collaborated on through her decades in Hollywood. It was, after all, one her father had given her.</p>
