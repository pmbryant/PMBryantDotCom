<p>It had been a few months since we had seen a new (for us) Judy Garland film. The drought finally ended a couple weeks back with In The Good Old Summertime. Our expectations were fulfilled, as it was a very enjoyable movie with good music and performances.</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t have any big production numbers, but Judy singing is quite a production by itself. And it does have one of my all-time favorite of Judy&#39;s performances in her song-and-dance to &quot;I Don&#39;t Care,&quot; which I had seen cli<span class="text_exposed_show">ps of earlier and was eagerly anticipating. </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>In The Good Old Summertime is a 1949 Technicolor MGM musical re-make of the 1940 non-musical Ernst Lubitsch comedy The Shop Around The Corner. Judy and Van Johnson star, taking the roles of Margaret Sullivan and James Stewart. The setting has been moved to a music store in turn-of-the-century Chicago. But many of the characters, sets, and scenes are eerily reminiscent of the earlier film. It&#39;s been 2-3 years since we watched The Shop Around The Corner but at times Van Johnson seemed to me to morph into Jimmy Stewart. This is not a bad thing; the Lubitsch version was excellent.</p>

<p>A major benefit of watching a number of classic Hollywood musicals over the last couple years is having discovered the films starring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. They did four such MGM musicals in the late &#39;30s and early &#39;40s, and the legendary Busby Berkeley directed three of them.</p>
<p>All had similar plots, but the stars are so charming and the musical numbers so fun that I wish there were more. The only flaws, albeit significant ones, are routines in two of the films (Bab<span class="text_exposed_show">es in Arms and Babes on Broadway) that are done in heavily-caricatured blackface, which are quite jarring to see.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Strike Up the Band, 1940, was the second of the four and the final one for us to see. And it is another winner. Mickey shows that he is a skilled drummer along with his many other talents, and Judy as usual is extremely compelling and sings wonderfully in her unique way. And there&#39;s some very enjoyable big band swing music thrown in, which I particularly enjoy.&#0160;</p>

<p>Summer Stock 1950. This was Judy Garland&#39;s last musical at MGM, the studio where she had worked since 1935 when she was 13 years old. It&#39;s got Judy in great form (on screen at least), and Gene Kelly as well, so of course it&#39;s enjoyable. The plot is a bit tired and implausible, but fortunately the performances make it easy to forget that, behind the scenes, there was turmoil.</p>
<p>But if you are interested in that turmoil... <a data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;-U&quot;}" data-lynx-mode="async" data-lynx-uri="https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcm.com%2Fthis-month%2Farticle%2F24094%257C0%2FSummer-Stock.html&amp;h=AT2Ug8rWb_KzOFeYhkp_9WiY48HwgGPbe7V6PiewpPTmueDuM3g58PBiVYZDyLLgHTZdnR7HdIP4PsJM966EiXbiITRP-Xa4ybauB4_Euxs9fwvyUoEyowkisZAq4U-LbsuM6Ss_OlE2PPBvbAVPcWQgnDne8WKhvjY86khLECDO8rpUSVF1zHNKMOPqJAVRou62BAkJOiUCRU48ozUM04sAbWQlTvvKJRAiZCOzdwiypZdXugQPK75DjaJThdBHxS3Zq6lZal6v8pmIdLQduS5yM-ZWxJZ_O2DG_U1-50dfJCznrlZuBP5kN99gBVkYP2JTcru_UreBqY7w_diRt6QkuFFd-2GldV0wUgEk9ZUYWoSGnzHYZlXlvflSwPFfEYtHP1lgD9t2NsQy8mc2R6BPY91iad3N7Q" href="http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/24094%7C0/Summer-Stock.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.tcm.com/this…/article/24094%7C0/Summer-Stock.html</a></p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The single event that kick-started my interest in classic Hollywood was my discovery of Preston Sturges&#39; great films of the 1940s very early in this decade. I was always searching for good, fun, diverting comedies to watch, and we had pretty much exhausted the limited supply of modern ones.</p>
<p>But I didn&#39;t really become a full-fledged classic Hollywood fan until my discovery of Fred Astaire a couple years later, in September 2013. The previously mysterious Ginger Rogers--who I of course had heard of, but alas had never seen a film of prior to late 2013--very soon became my favorite actress.</p>
<p>As I explored more and more films from the 1930s and 1940s, my list of favorites grew. My list has changed modestly over these last few years, but currently these are my favorite actors and actresses of that era, and hence of all time.</p>
<p>Actresses:</p>
<p><strong>Ginger Rogers</strong> still is at the top of my list. <strong>Judy Garland</strong>, as the only other actress I know besides Ginger who was fabulous at four talents--drama, comedy, singing, dancing--has been in the next position for years, but <strong>Ida Lupino</strong> is up there with her now. Amazingly it wasn&#39;t until 2017 that I started seeing a significant number of Ida&#39;s films. I had taken notice of her right away, but full appreciation of her work took a while to break into my consciousness. <strong>Glenda Farrell</strong>, despite not getting many lead roles, is next thanks to her brilliant comic persona.</p>
<p>The next tier consists of <strong>Joan Blondell</strong>, <strong>Jean Arthur</strong>, <strong>Barbara Stanwyck</strong>, <strong>Bette Davis</strong>. On occasion I think <strong>Myrna Loy</strong> and <strong>Kay Francis</strong> may graduate into this tier, but I don&#39;t think I can put them there yet. <strong>Alice Brady</strong> deserves an honorable mention as well.</p>
<p>Actors:</p>
<p><strong>Fred Astaire</strong> is obviously at the top. <strong>William Powell</strong> was an earlier discovery, though, as I found <em>My Man Godfrey</em> and <em>The Thin Man</em> a year or two before the Astaire-Rogers movies. Right below these two are <strong>Edward G. Robinson,</strong> <strong>James Cagney, Cary Grant,</strong><strong> Dick Powell</strong>, <strong>Lionel Barrymore</strong>, and <strong>Edward Everett Horton</strong>. Honorable mention goes to <strong>Jack Carson</strong>, <strong>Joel McCrea</strong>, <strong>Don Ameche</strong>, and perhaps a few others.</p></div>
