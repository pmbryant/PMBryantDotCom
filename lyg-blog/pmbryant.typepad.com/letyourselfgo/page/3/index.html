The 1941 Warner Brothers film <em>High Sierra</em> was a landmark in the careers of its stars, Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart—marking a transition from years of frustration to full-fledged stardom for both. <em>High Sierra</em> provided the first starring role for Bogart in a prestige project, and it was Lupino's first lead after her attention-getting supporting performance in <em>They Drive By Night</em>. Various sources relate different stories of the working relationship of the two new stars during this classic movie's production. Depending on what you read, you can get the impression that the two were close to lovers or that they throughly detested each other. </p>

<p>The feud stories were predominant in the period right before and after the film was released. For instance, shortly before the opening, an item in a nationally-syndicated gossip column claimed that Bogart and Lupino never spoke on set except in their scenes together. Several months later, a preeminent movie magazine headlined the Lupino-Bogart relationship in an article titled "Who Hates Whom in Hollywood"—saying "The Lupino-Bogart feud is one of Hollywood's liveliest." </p>

<p>Modern sources, however, frequently discount any feud based on observations from others working on the set. Film historian Eddie Muller claimed in a 2019 segment on  TCM that the rumors Lupino and Bogart did not get along during <em>High Sierra</em> were "nonsense". The thoroughly-researched biography of Bogart by Ann Sperber and Eric Lax reports that "no one connected with <em>High Sierra</em> saw anything to suggest animosity between Bogart and Lupino; all the evidence is to the contrary." </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1264e22200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1264e22200b img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino, Mayo Methot, Humphrey Bogart and Irving Rapper on location for High Sierra (Alamy stock photo)" title="Ida Lupino, Mayo Methot, Humphrey Bogart and Irving Rapper on location for High Sierra (Alamy stock photo)" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1264e22200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Irving Rapper, dialogue director on <em>High Sierra</em>, provided key evidence used by Sperber-Lax and others to counteract the alleged feud. In a later interview, Rapper stated that "Bogie was crazy about Ida", and that "Ida was in love with [Bogart]". Lupino's and Bogart's respective spouses, actor Louis Hayward and actress Mayo Methot, visited the set frequently, and according to Rapper, "[Lupino] was evidently too charming. Mayo Methot was jealous." </p>

<p>Lupino was always effusive in her remembrances of Bogart, who died in 1957. For instance, she contributed an endearing tribute, including a story from their work together on <em>High Sierra</em>, as part of the 1967 television documentary <em>Bogart</em>. Lupino said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find it very hard to cry in front of a whole crew. 
  Especially when they'd say, 'Quiet, everybody, quiet!' 
  I'd freeze up. I couldn't do anything.</p>
  
  <p>So, Bogey sensed this. This was the side of this man—this tough guy—that, you know, his friends knew. But I didn't know. </p>
  
  <p>He took me to one side and looked at our director, Raoul Walsh, and gave him a sign, and he said, 'Listen, doll. If you can't cry, just remember one thing—I'm going to take the picture away from you.' 
  Oh, I started to laugh. And I said, 'Now listen, Bogey, I can't cry. Don't break me up.' 
  He said, 'All right, you're relaxed.' And I said, 'Yes, I am, but now I can't cry.' 
  He said, 'All right, next step. Come on.' He walked me further away. </p>
  
  <p>And he said, 'Just try to think of one thing. If you can't relate it to me or the character—my character, right now—go back to your childhood. Can you remember when you had to say goodbye to somebody—somebody you loved—and you thought you weren't going to see them again?' 
  And I said, 'yes'. </p>
  
  <p>And he said, 'Well think of that, baby, that of it!' </p>
  
  <p>And there were tears in his eyes. And before I knew it, I was crying!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a separate interview, Lupino said about Bogart that "It didn't turn out for us to be lovers. But we did care about each other. Being with him was absolutely heaven, and I guess he didn't think I was too bad."</p>

<p>In contrast to the claim in Sperber-Lax that "all the evidence [about a feud] is to the contrary", several notable pieces suggest the animosity rumors had some truth. First, shortly after the filming of <em>High Sierra</em>, Bogart repeatedly expressed the belief that Lupino had used her influence to prevent him from being cast with her again in <em>Out of the Fog</em>. Second, Sperber-Lax recount an interview Bogart gave three years later where he "allegedly acknowledged giving Lupino quite a verbal battering" during <em>High Sierra</em>. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e127a441200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e127a441200b img-responsive" alt="Opening pages of article The Truth About Myself by Ida Lupino, Screenland, Nov. 1945" title="Opening pages of article The Truth About Myself by Ida Lupino, Screenland, Nov. 1945" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e127a441200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Finally, a smoking gun came five years after the events. In 1945, Lupino herself wrote that she and Bogart did not speak for two years after <em>High Sierra</em>. This confession came in an article published in the November 1945 issue of Screenland magazine titled <em>The Truth About Myself, by Ida Lupino</em>. In the article, Lupino debunks numerous inaccuracies that had been related about her over the years. But with the <em>High Sierra</em> stories, she does the opposite:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to gossip, I have been involved in more feuds than any other Hollywood actress. Actually, I have had only one real feud. </p>
  
  <p>There are three kinds of Hollywood feuds—the real kind, the publicity type which is used to promote a picture, and the kind which isn't a feud at all but is just a slight misunderstanding which is blown up out of all proportion.</p>
  
  <p>I once had a real feud with Humphrey Bogart, when we were working on 'High Sierra'. 
  I have a way of kidding with a straight face; so has Bogey. 
  Neither of us recognized the trait in the other. 
  Each of us thought the other was being nasty, and we were both offended. 
  For a long time we would pass each other with our noses up in the air. 
  For two years we didn't speak. 
  Then one day I was working on a picture with Paul Henreid and we went over to the set where Bogey was working to wish his director, Curtis Bernhardt, good luck on his new picture. 
  Bogey had to look right at me and I at him. 
  We both began to laugh—and that broke the ice. Now we are very good friends. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing the contrasting stories from different sources over the years, I found it interesting to investigate how the Lupino-Bogart relationship was described in the press in real time.</p>

<p><em>High Sierra production</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278804de015200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20278804de015200d img-responsive" alt="Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino in a promotional still for High Sierra" title="Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino in a promotional still for High Sierra" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278804de015200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Ida Lupino was cast as a lead in <em>High Sierra</em> in early July, 1940. This came shortly after her excellent performance in <em>They Drive By Night</em>, her first film at Warner Brothers and the role that propelled her to major stardom. Paul Muni was slated for the male lead in <em>High Sierra</em> at the time. Within a week, though, Muni and Warner Brothers had broken up. The studio needed a new star—and Humphrey Bogart, who had been campaigning for the role, was the logical choice.</p>

<p>Lupino and Bogart had first met during the filming of <em>They Drive By Night</em> a couple months earlier. But they did not share many scenes together. So, according to Lupino, she "didn't get to know [Bogart] at the time." </p>

<p>Production on <em>High Sierra</em> began on August 5. The crew, led by director Raoul Walsh, initially travelled to the Arrowhead Springs resort in the mountains outside Los Angeles. Two weeks later they returned to Hollywood for studio setups. In mid-September, the company went on another location trip—this time to Lone Pine and the Sierra Nevada mountains. On September 19, they all returned to Hollywood, wrapping filming a week later.</p>

<p>In the initial press reports, there is no evidence of any problems between the film's two stars. A reporter for Photoplay magazine visited the set and found "real excitement":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here was the picture Paul Muni dropped his Warners contract rather than make. 
  Here was Bogey, as all Hollywood calls him, getting his first real starring role.
  And here was Miss Lupino, "the new sensation", as they told us, forgetting all about Ida's seven discouraging years already spent in flicker town.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60473200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60473200c img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino smiling, with Raoul Walsh and Humphrey Bogart behind the scenes of High Sierra" title="Ida Lupino smiling, with Raoul Walsh and Humphrey Bogart behind the scenes of High Sierra" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60473200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>In an August 28 column, Sheilah Graham related that while she was interviewing Ida Lupino on set, "Humphrey Bogart joins us. He is smiling and happy." The two stars  good-naturedly discussed the film together. Ironically, in this interview, Lupino was compelled to deny rumors that she and Ann Sheridan were feuding after their work in <em>They Drive By Night</em>: "It's utter nonsense. Ann Sheridan and I have been friends ever since she came here seven years ago. Ann's first picture was with me. We lived together for a year. I don't blame her for not liking her part in 'They Drive By Night,' but she's too real a person to let it upset our friendship."</p>

<p>One alleged feud was shot down; but another soon was born. The next day Jimmie Fidler wrote that Lupino and Bogart "are stepping on each other's toes". He included no details. This is the only published indication of any discord between Lupino and Bogart that I have been able to find that was reported during production.</p>

<p>A couple weeks later, during the Lone Pine location shoot in mid-September, something more significant may have happened to affect Lupino and Bogart's relationship. On September 29, a few days after filming completed, Louella Parsons wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm surprised to hear that there was plenty of temperament on the location of 'High Sierra', with most of the flare-ups between Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart. 
  Ida is such a level-headed little person and I've known Humphrey so long it is difficult to believe they had trouble to the point of the little Lupino threatening to walk out. 
  It's true that big success has come to both of them suddenly with the past year—but they're both real troupers who have never begrudged honors before. 
  Well, location trips are tough on everybody's nerves so maybe that was the reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few months later, Dorothy Kilgallen wrote that the "tiff" between Bogart and Lupino had started when the two and their spouses "shared a cottage... and stopped talking!"</p>

<p>Speculating on what may have precipitated a conflict, the Sperber-Lax book points out that, on September 18—the day before the company left Lone Pine—Warner Brothers executive producer Hal Wallis had decided to give Lupino top billing over Bogart. The next two days, studio records list Lupino as unable to work due to a rash or illness. Sperber-Lax then write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the absence of records no one knows whether Bogart took out his disappointment on Lupino or even if they had a direct confrontation. 
  He knew well enough that she had nothing to do with the decision, and she later insisted that "he never said a word about" the [billing] change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sperber-Lax also report that Lupino thought Bogart was unhappy "toward the finish".</p>

<p>Some in the press tried to discount the discord rumors, even at the time. A photo taken in August at Arrowhead Springs resort, in the early stages of filming, was captioned in Screenland magazine's December 1940 issue: "This pleasant picture of Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart, left, with Irving Rapper, dialogue director, while on location for 'High Sierra', makes us doubt the rumors that Ida and Bogey were tiffing because one was trying to steal scenes from the other."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef605d0200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef605d0200c img-responsive" alt="Humphrey Bogart, Ida Lupino and Irving Rapper in a pleasant scene poolside at Arrowhead Springs resort while filming High Sierra, Screenland magazine, December 1940" title="Humphrey Bogart, Ida Lupino and Irving Rapper in a pleasant scene poolside at Arrowhead Springs resort while filming High Sierra, Screenland magazine, December 1940" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef605d0200c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a><br /></p>

<p><em>Immediately after High Sierra</em></p>

<p>Whatever friction between Lupino and Bogart that developed on the set of <em>High Sierra</em> had fallout a few months later with the casting of <em>Out of the Fog</em> (which had the working title of <em>The Gentle People</em>). </p>

<p>Warners, sensing they had a hit on their hands with <em>High Sierra</em>, considered re-teaming its two stars. In the last few weeks of 1940,  while Lupino was working on <em>The Sea Wolf</em> with Edward G. Robinson and John Garfield, press items appeared suggesting that she and Bogart would do a picture titled <em>Highway 99</em>; other items paired them in <em>The Gentle People</em>. In December, Bogart was sent east to do a personal appearance tour with his wife in preparation for the opening of <em>High Sierra</em> a month later.</p>

<p>Bogart had not been notified of any new role. While on his New York trip, he sent a cable to Warners producer Henry Blanke asking if the "rumor" about <em>The Gentle People</em> was true, adding that it "seems like a good idea". Apparently the casting rumor was not true—at least not yet. James Cagney and George Raft were the studio's top choices, though both soon turned it down. Bogart continued his campaign for the role.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60538200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60538200c img-responsive" alt="Ad for High Sierra in Modern Screen magazine, February 1941" title="Ad for High Sierra in Modern Screen magazine, February 1941" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60538200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>With advance publicity for the late January opening of <em>High Sierra</em> kicking into gear, new press items relating to the rumored Bogart-Lupino discord appeared. On December 27, Jimmie Fidler wrote that Bogart, in his appearances in New York, "could hold audiences spellbound with reports of how 'beautifully' he and Ida Lupino got along during the filming of that picture." </p>

<p>Then on December 31, Paul Harrison published this sensationalized item: "Except on one occasion—when she told him plenty—Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart spoke to each other only in the dialog on 'High Sierra'."</p>

<p>After all the other stories from the set of <em>High Sierra</em>, this—coming several months after filming completed—is not believable. It is perhaps a press agent's idea of how to get attention for the new movie by building on the earlier rumors.

<p><em>Casting controversy</em></p>

<p><em>The Gentle People</em>, released under the title <em>Out of the Fog</em>, was a high-profile Warner Brothers production based on a play by Irwin Shaw. Lupino was considered for a leading role as early as December, while, as we saw, Bogart was rumored for the male lead—an unsympathetic racketeer named Goff. </p>

<p>While Cagney and Raft had turned the Goff role down, Bogart was eager for it; and so was fellow Warner contractee John Garfield. In the latter half of January, while Bogart was pushing for a meeting with Jack Warner to discuss the role, several Hollywood columnists were printing that Lupino's husband, Louis Hayward, was a candidate as well—despite Hayward's not having a contract with Warners. One columnist even claimed that Hayward was being tested and that Lupino did the test with him. (Lupino and Hayward were definitely trying to find a vehicle to work together in at the time. Very soon, the couple would be cast together in <em>Ladies in Retirement</em> at Columbia, which was filmed in the early summer of 1941.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1265067200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1265067200b img-responsive" alt="Out of the Fog poster" title="Out of the Fog poster" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1265067200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>As of January 31, 1941, internal Warners documents had Bogart penciled in for the Goff role in <em>The Gentle People</em>. But in the press and in the internal memos of the Warner executives, John Garfield had emerged as the most likely candidate. Sheilah Graham wrote that Garfield "probably" had the role; while behind the scenes, producer Blanke told Jack Warner that casting Garfield would eliminate "the problem of convincing Lupino to play with Bogart". On February 4, Jack Warner cabled executive producer Hal Wallis that "Lupino refuses to play in picture with Bogart." On February 7, Garfield's casting as Goff became official. Bogart was soon assigned to <em>Manpower</em> with Marlene Dietrich and George Raft.</p>

<p>The internal Warners documents claiming Lupino did not want to work with Bogart were devoid of the usual detail, according to Sperber-Lax. They suggest that it is possible "the studio invented the slight as a means of not casting Bogart and shifting the onus onto Lupino". Lupino's memories support this interpretation. In an interview decades later, she vociferously denied that she refused to work with Bogart in <em>Out of the Fog</em>, saying, "Warners was absolutely lying, completely untrue, completely untrue." [Ida Lupino: Beyond the Camera]. At the time, though, Bogart believed that Lupino had pushed him out of the film.</p>

<p><em>Suspension</em></p>

<p>Bogart's unhappiness with losing the Goff role was compounded when George Raft asked for him to be removed from <em>Manpower</em>. As Bogart saw it, Ida Lupino and George Raft were casting movies at Warners now—at his expense. On top of that, he strongly disliked the next script Warners gave him—<em>Bad Men of Missouri</em>. In early April, he refused that role and the studio suspended him.</p>

<p>During the suspension, Bogart's displeasure made the papers. On April 13, Whitney Bolton, presenting himself as a personal friend of Bogart's, wrote an opinion column in the Philadelphia Inquirer describing hostility between Lupino and Bogart during <em>High Sierra</em>—"icy goings-on"—although "they never actually had words". Then he repeats the story that Lupino did not wish to work with Bogart again and lambasts her repeatedly (and Raft as well). A sample: "The best that can be deduced from all those triple plays is that Miss Lupino and Raft skitter away from having an actor in their pictures. It would be possible for Bogart to get in there and pitch and steal 'Gentle People' from Lupino. It would be even less trouble for him to steal it from George." </p>

<p>This is a long, mean-spirited essay and hard to take literally—though coming from a self-identified friend of Bogart, it is evidence of significant bad feelings. Since this made it into print, what kind of talk was going on in private? The two years that Lupino mentioned of her and Bogart not speaking become understandable. </p>

<p><em>Epilogue</em></p>

<p>A month or so later, Bogart's professional situation turned around drastically when Warners put him back on the payroll and cast him as the lead in <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>. On the set of that legendary film in June, Bogart repeated the idea that Lupino had kept him out of the earlier film: "I was up for the John Garfield part in 'Out of the Fog', but Ida Lupino didn't want me." The bad feelings remained. </p>

<p>Within a few years of <em>High Sierra</em>, as Lupino recounted in her 1945 article, she and Bogart had transformed from cool antagonists into solid friends. An example comes from late 1944: Hedda Hopper tells of Bogart, with Lauren Bacall accompanying him during the early stages of their highly-publicized romance, taking time off from <em>The Big Sleep</em> to visit Ida Lupino on the set of <em>Pillow to Post</em>. Numerous other anecdotes in various publications show Lupino and Bogart socializing during the mid and late 1940s. And, of course, Lupino's own words in 1945 relate that they were "very good friends". Finally, there are Lupino's remembrances of Bogart many years later:</p>

<p>"When he liked you and he believed in you, he was the most loyal, wonderful guy in the whole wide world."</p>

<p><em>The Beginning or the End: How Hollywood—and America—Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</em> by Greg Mitchell tells a very interesting story. It is a story that joins two separate interests of mine: classic Hollywood and American history. </p>

<p>The first half of the book concentrates on the behind-the-scenes story of how the movie <em>The Beginning or the End</em> (1947) was put together by MGM studio, starting very soon after the two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan in August, 1945. This story highlights all the various compromises that went into the final product to satisfy the government and Army, which MGM viewed as a imperative. Along the way, it also depicts how the atomic scientists' cautionary warnings for the coming atomic age—the initial inspiration for the motion picture—were gradually left by the wayside. </p>

<p>The last half departs from the Hollywood focus and relates the politics and history of the aftermath of President Truman's decision to use the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>

<p>Overall, Mitchell's book is well-written and a page-turner, though there are many passages that could be tightened up significantly. <em>The Beginning or the End</em> left me wanting to find another book that takes the story of the beginning of the atomic age past early 1947, when this movie was released. And of course it also inspired me to track down and watch the actual movie in question, which was fascinating in its own peculiar way—especially knowing all that went into it after reading Mitchell's book.</p>

It is the story of a year in her young life that saw her career fortunes tumble unexpectedly and precipitously.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1937, Ida Lupino was one of the most talked-about young actresses in Hollywood and had just been awarded a contract extension and a raise from her home studio. Approaching her nineteenth birthday, it appeared she was on her way to the top.</p>

<p>At the end of 1937, Ida Lupino was out of work—with no contract and with no screen prospects.</p>

<p>How did this happen?</p>

<p>Lupino started that year as a Hollywood veteran of over three years and a lead actress of nearly four, including films she made in her native England  She was celebrated as an accomplished light comedienne, plus was gradually winning more acclaim as an actress.</p>

<p>She had been under contract to Paramount studios since mid-1933. They  had immediately put her into lead or prominent supporting roles in modestly-budgeted films, then had moved her into supporting roles in prestigious fare like the Gary Cooper-Ann Harding drama <em>Peter Ibbetson</em> and the Bing Crosby musical <em>Anything Goes</em>. </p>

<p>In 1936, she had the good fortune of Paramount loaning her to a new independent studio run by United Artists co-founder Mary Pickford and producer Jesse L. Lasky. There, Lupino made a big splash in two comedies: first as Francis Lederer's leading lady in <em>One Rainy Afternoon</em>; then, thanks to her strong showing in the first, as opera singer Nino Martini's in <em>The Gay Desperado</em>. Her performances in these well-publicized films, bracketing a juicy role in Paramount's own <em>Yours For The Asking</em> as a humorous crook, propelled her to a new level of stardom. She appeared to be on the verge of a major breakthrough.

Unfortunately, Paramount could not produce another good role for Lupino. A lead role in a forgettable football picture called <em>Rose Bowl</em> was her next assignment. An attack of tonsillitis spared her from from that role—probably for the best. In the last months of 1936, Paramount loaned Lupino out for two modestly better films, but still in innocuous leading lady parts: RKO's <em>Sea Devils</em> and Columbia's <em>Let's Get Married</em>. As Lupino was highly-sought after for such "ingenue" roles, Paramount exercised its option on Lupino's contract and gave her a raise from $1000 to $1750 per week.</p>

<p>"Ida was not the sort to be content with smooth sailing and comfortable checks. She had ambition," wrote Hedda Hopper a few years later. </p>

<p>So, at the end of 1936, Lupino was troubled. <em>Picture Play</em> magazine caught up with her in an anxious mood: "I've been fighting with every one at the studio, and I don't think my career is doing very well." She realized she was at a critical juncture. She had worked to put herself in a position to rise into the top tier of Hollywood actresses. Yet she could easily sink into a sea of undistinguishable starlets if Paramount continued to give her average parts in unmemorable movies.</p>

<p>On a brighter note, her hobby of composing music was taking off and earning her substantial publicity. Press reports suggested she was aiming to have thirty of her songs published. She also wrote chorus music for local stage performances. One piece of hers, variously referred to as "Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp" or "Aladin Suite", was performed and broadcast over the radio twice in February by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. Describing the Aladdin performance, the Los Angeles Times wrote that Lupino had "penned some most excellent music and lyrics."</p>

<p>By late March, both <em>Sea Devils</em> and <em>Let's Get Married</em> had been released to modest reviews—and garnered Lupino little attention. One reviewer of the latter described Lupino as "now at the peak of her screen career", but mentioned that was due to her 1936 Pickford-Lasky films.

In mid-April, Paramount cast Lupino in a movie on their own lot for the first time in almost a year. Jack Benny picked her to be his co-star in an elaborate musical production called <em>Artists and Models</em>. Lupino and Richard Arlen would play the romantic leads in a plot-thin farce that was essentially a variety show. Despite Lupino's music and dancing skills, she was not involved in any of the production numbers. The film is enjoyable and well-produced, but the limited role must not have been fulfilling. (<em>Artists and Models</em> notably marks the first of four times Lupino was directed by Raoul Walsh, who later became one of her mentors for her directing career.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e11b0f68200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e11b0f68200b img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Artists And Models (1937) poster" title="Artists And Models (1937) poster" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e11b0f68200b-300wi" /></a>As preparations began, a press item noted that Lupino had changed her hair color from blonde to "light brown, her natural color". One of Lupino's more memorable scenes in <em>Artists and Models</em> involved her falling into a swimming pool while wearing an extravagant evening gown. Columnist (and her close friend) Harry Mines reported her discomfort. "In practically everything I've done, I've taken a soaking," she said. "But I think this is the worst. The pool is so shallow I'm afraid I'll brain myself. I'd hate to be poor Dick [Arlen]. He has to dive in head-first." She added, "I know I have to do it. There's no way out."</p>

<p>Her composing hobby continued. In May, the BBC reportedly requested some of her songs to be played during the coronation of King George VI. In June, orchestra leader Andre Kostelanetz, also involved in <em>Artists and Models</em>, used one of Lupino's songs on his national radio program, which reportedly left her "agog".</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: left;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2027880429af0200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2027880429af0200d img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" alt="Fight For Your Lady (1937) poster" title="Fight For Your Lady (1937) poster" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2027880429af0200d-300wi" /></a>When <em>Artists and Models</em> concluded in late June, Paramount immediately shipped Lupino off to another studio, loaning her back to RKO for another innocuous leading lady role—this time in a Jack Oakie comedy, <em>Fight For Your Lady</em>. Lupino's romantic counterpart would be John Boles. In this movie, she finally had a chance to reveal some of her non-acting talents, playing a singing ventriloquist. She also has a solo dancing routine with a dummy in top-hat-and-tails, a la Fred Astaire. Alas, virtually none of her routine made the final cut, with the camera instead focused on Oakie and Boles mugging at each other in the audience.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, the press regularly commented on the long-term romance of Lupino with actor Louis Hayward—who she had been dating regularly since early in 1936. The press frequently suggested they were on the brink of marriage. In early August, Lupino was reported saying that she'd love to marry him, but "he hasn't asked me yet." The reason was that each wanted to get more professionally established first. </p>

<p>After <em>Fight For Your Lady</em> completed filming in August, Lupino's mentions in the press dropped off dramatically. No prospective projects were publicized. The most notable press item regarding her in this period was in late October when Louella Parsons and another columnist mentioned that Gary Cooper was using Lupino's dressing room after refusing Carole Lombard's because it was "too dainty".</p>

<p>This was the calm before the storm that was about to erupt. It would be fascinating to know what was going on behind the scenes between Lupino and Paramount in the fall of 1937.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdeeab8da200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdeeab8da200c img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Her Jungle Love (1938) poster" title="Her Jungle Love (1938) poster" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdeeab8da200c-250wi" /></a>The storm hit in mid-November. </p>

<p>"Ida Lupino walked out of Paramount a few days ago taking her contract with her," Louella Parsons reported on November 20. "Her grievance is <em>Jungle Lover</em>, in which she was asked to support Dorothy Lamour, who was just starting when Ida was playing leads. Playing second fiddle isn't the little Lupino's only annoyance, but her brief four pages of dialogue was the straw that really broke the camel's back." </p>

<p>Two very prominent New York columnists also mentioned the Lupino-Paramount blow-up. On November 22, Ed Sullivan wrote that "Ida Lupino could have got her Paramount release without stalking off the lot." On the 24th, Walter Winchell picked it up, saying "Ida Lupino walked out of <em>Her Jungle Love</em> rather than risk emoting in a pewy role. The contract she mutually agreed to tear up brought her $1,750 per!"</p>

<p>"Paramount had decided to get rid of me," Lupino told a reporter three years later. She added, "The studio handed me a part which was so brief it was an insult. I quit—and we were both happy." Paramount had a replacement officially named the next day—the inexperienced and then-unknown Dorothy Howe (later and better known as Virginia Vale)—indicating that they were not exactly surprised by Lupino's abrupt walkout.</p>

<p>Years afterward, after Lupino had reconstituted her career and reached new heights, she credited Hedda Hopper with encouraging this "rebellion". Hopper was still an actress and not yet a notorious gossip columnist. She and Lupino had become friendly on the set of <em>Artists and Models</em>, so Lupino asked Hopper's advice on how to break out of her rut of ingenue roles. Hopper encouraged her to change to a more natural look and to "go and think and study a bit about acting", as Lupino recalled. </p>

<p>Lupino told Hopper, “It’s now or never, if I’m going to get anywhere."</p>

<p>With her walkout, Lupino's four-year tenure at Paramount was suddenly over. Her substantial paycheck was gone. With an unremarkable series of roles over the previous year, would she be able to succeed as a free-lance actress? Nothing concrete was on the horizon.</p>

<p>Louella Parsons suggested Lupino's new plan was to return to her native England and make a picture with her father—well-known stage and screen comedian Stanley Lupino. She also had Louis Hayward to consider, who was intent on establishing himself in American movies. So to close out the year, Lupino remained in Hollywood, taking a radio gig in mid-December on Cecil B. DeMille's Lux Radio Theater, co-starring with Robert Montgomery in <em>The Thirty-Nine Steps</em>. The brief on-air chat after the drama did not mention any screen prospects for Lupino. Instead, they discussed her music hobby. "What's your latest composition?" DeMille asked. Lupino replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something I've just sent to London. 
  The score and book for a musical comedy. 
  Look, I hope no one is going to get the impression that I think I'm a great musician.
  In fact, I know so little that I often use a code to take the place of notes and musical symbols until I have time to figure out what I'm trying to do. 
  I use the letters of the alphabet for a code.
  If you ever saw one of my scores, you'd think someone had spilled alphabet soup on an orchestration sheet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, Lupino would not return to England to make pictures there, and she would not start work on another Hollywood film for another year. </p>

<p>As 1937 drew to a close, Lupino was entering her career wilderness phase—apparently washed up before her twentieth birthday. It was a challenging period for her, but it would set her up for the breakthrough that did happen in 1939. That is a story for another day.</p>

<p>Aside from a brief introduction by the editor, the 1971 book <em>Hollywood and the Great Fan Magazines</em> is a curated collection of articles from old Hollywood fan magazines. The articles are not dated, but they are exclusively from the 1930s, with a few from 1940-41. They appear to retain similar formatting to the original source material, including accompanying photos with captions.</p>

<p>As someone fascinated by old Hollywood and familiar with many, if not most, of the names of that era, this was a very enjoyable read. (Admittedly, I skipped over perhaps 1/3 of the articles that were about personalities I am not particularly interested in.) The articles are clearly not randomly chosen, as at one point there were several articles about Joan Bennett and her marriages/divorces in the 1930s right after each other in the book, though several years apart in real time. Bette Davis gets a similar treatment later. </p>

<p>The subject matter of most of the articles was about the personal relationships of various stars, but there were a few broader Hollywood subjects occasionally discussed. Nothing focusing on any specific movies of the period was included, by my recollection.</p>

<p>Particularly noteworthy to me was reading an article about Joan Blondell discussing her very young son, Norman (born in 1934). The article appears to have been written in 1935, while Blondell was still married to George Barnes (divorced in 1936). I know from other reading that Blondell later married Dick Powell and young Norman took the Powell name. I looked up Norman Powell and discovered he had been a successful television executive and was still alive. Alas, less than a week later, news hit that this same Norman Powell had passed away at age 86.</p>

<p>While many of these magazines from which the articles in this book were taken are these days available online via the <a href="https://mediahistoryproject.org/">Media History Digital Library</a> (a terrific resource!), it was still quite fun to have this specific collection assembled in a book form to leaf through.</p>

<p><em>Ladies in Retirement</em> is an excellent play. The title doesn't quite indicate what to expect, but it could be considered a gothic thriller. Some have compared it to <em>Arsenic and Old Lace</em>, but other than involving some not-very-sane older women and being set in an old house, it is quite dissimilar. <em>Ladies in Retirement</em> is decidedly <em>not</em> a comedy.</p>

<p><em>Ladies in Retirement</em> was written by Edward Percy and Reginald Denham and originally performed on Broadway in 1940, with Flora Robson in the starring role. The play was a substantial hit and was soon adapted for the screen by Columbia Pictures.</p>

<p>The play's script is virtually the same as the great 1941 film starring Ida Lupino and Louis Hayward. If you’re familiar with the movie, what differences there are can be fascinating. One notable difference is that the critical murder takes place after a curtain closing in the play, while it is depicted in real time in the film, albeit off-screen. I also think Ellen Creed, the Robson/Lupino character, is less sympathetic in the play.</p>

<p>One major difference between seeing a play performed and the experience of reading the script is that the stage directions interrupt the flow of the dialogue. I am not used to reading play scripts, so that took some getting used to, and I don't think I quite got there. Yet I still very much enjoyed reading the source material for one of my all-time favorite films.</p>

(I originally posted a variant of this on Goodreads.) #classicfilmreading</p>

<p><em>Phantom Lady</em> was an interesting, well-written, well-researched biography about a previously neglected person in the history of the Golden Age of Hollywood. Joan Harrison was one of only a handful of women producers in pre-1960s Hollywood, and was one of Alfred Hitchcock's primary collaborators in the late 1930s and early 1940s. </p>

<p>While this was certainly a worthwhile read, I did have some concerns. One is that the author spends too much of the text in detailed plot summaries of numerous movies Joan Harrison helped to create (and at least one she did not) and not enough portraying Harrison as a real person with a personality. In addition to slowing down the biographical narrative, this leads to spoilers of movies I was planning to watch or re-watch soon thanks to being reminded of them by this book. </p>

<p>Perhaps a more fundamental issue: by the end, I didn't feel like I knew Joan as a human being, aside from as someone consumed by her work. I probably learned more personal details about Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma Reville than about Harrison. The Kindle edition I purchased also doesn’t appear to have any photographs, which may have helped partially counteract this last deficiency. </p>

It was made at a crossroads of her life and career, when she was in the middle of an extended transition from leading actress to being a writer, producer, and director.</p>

<p>As part of the larger story of the making of this film, here is the story of how its cast was assembled. This tale brings together a number of interesting personalities in post-war Hollywood, several of whom were also at critical points in their respective careers.</p>

<p><em>Originator: Ida Lupino</em></p>

<p>In September, 1947, Ida Lupino herself initiated the project that became <em>Road House</em>. Early that year, Lupino had finished her long-term contract at Warner Brothers. Seeking creative control over her acting career, she rejected a new exclusive contract and instead chose to become an independent producer. In February, she formed Arcadia Productions with producer Benedict Bogeaus and took on the job of producer of her own movies, with an ambition to produce others as well. By late summer, however, she had nothing to show for her hard work. (See this <a href="../../2021/02/never-again-the-story-of-ida-lupino-and-arcadia-productions.html">earlier article</a> for more on this episode in Lupino's career.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1b99200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1b99200c img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino in 'Road House'" title="Ida Lupino in 'Road House'" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1b99200c-250wi" /></a>Meanwhile, amongst the many scripts, stories, and books she had been poring over in search of good material, Lupino found a story called <em>The Dark Love</em>, by Margaret Gruen and Oscar Saul. She decided that this story should be her next project. At this time, prominent Hollywood agent Charles Feldman was attempting to win her services, and he and Ida worked out a deal where they purchased the story rights for $20,000 and then sold them to 20th Century-Fox with the condition that Lupino play the lead. Her salary would be $95,000, plus $15,000 profit on the story sale. Feldman waived his commissions and Lupino joined his agency.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this story deal happened at virtually the same time that Lupino dissolved Arcadia Productions. The first mention of Lupino's interest in <em>Dark Love</em> in the Hollywood press was on September 2, 1947 in a Hedda Hopper column. The very next day Sheilah Graham carried an item that "Ida Lupino and Benedict Bogeaus have called off their picture deal. They couldn't get together on story or price." Ten days after that, Louella Parsons broke the news that Lupino would be doing <em>The Dark Love</em>—already retitled <em>Road House</em>—at 20th Century-Fox. </p>

<p>Could the Lupino-Bogeaus breakup have been precipitated by <em>The Dark Love</em>? Why did Lupino not attempt to produce <em>The Dark Love</em> herself via Arcadia Productions as she had tried with other material? Here are some considerations: first, after seven months of unsuccessful attempts at producing other pictures, she was frustrated with that role; second, Feldman's deal was very lucrative for her and also provided her choice of story; third, she had a contractual obligation to 20th Century-Fox for one picture—an obligation that had been outstanding for several years. </p>

<p>So Lupino gave up her independent production efforts—temporarily, it turned out—and returned to acting at one of the large Hollywood studios. The fact that she had selected the story, though, was a major difference from her earlier career, when she was a contract player with little to no say in the material she was given.</p>

<p><em>Co-star Victor Mature?</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202788027070c200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202788027070c200d img-responsive" style="width: 160px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Victor Mature" title="Victor Mature" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202788027070c200d-200wi" /></a>The initial press reports for <em>Road House</em> in September mentioned Victor Mature as Lupino's leading man. Mature, a star at 20th Century-Fox for several years but long derided as an actor, was riding a wave of good notices for his performance in <em>Kiss of Death</em>—released the previous month. As Louella Parsons wrote in her item announcing the <em>Road House</em> role for Lupino, "I used to feel I could take or leave [Victor Mature] as an actor, but now I do not want to leave him, because he is that good." In mid-October, Hedda Hopper wrote that Mature was the "hottest star in town".</p>

<p><em>Road House</em> was originally slated to begin production in November. It would not actually start until late the next March. Press reports are not explicit about the reasons for the delays, but it is likely that finding a director and casting the two leading male roles contributed. Four directors turned down the project, according to William Donati in his Lupino biography. And while Lee J. Cobb was the initial name tossed around for the "heavy" role, according to film historian Eddie Muller in the 2008 DVD commentary, 20th Century-Fox studio chief Darryl Zanuck wanted hot newcomer Richard Widmark. Waiting for him to be available may thus have been another reason.</p>

<p>Victor Mature was still being mentioned in the press as Lupino's leading man as late as November 24. But that same month, other reports suggested that <em>The Chair for Martin Rome</em> (later released as <em>Cry of the City</em>) would be Mature's next film. Indeed, that film started production in late December and Mature was in the starring role. The identity of Lupino's co-star for <em>Road House</em> was still up in the air.</p>

<p>Lupino did not let the delays stop her from preparing. In late December, Sheilah Graham wrote that "most of the story takes place in a bowling alley. And that's where you'll find Ida these days and evenings—learning to bowl."</p>

<p><em>Academy-award candidate Celeste Holm</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2027880270664200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2027880270664200d img-responsive" style="width: 160px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Celeste Holm" title="Celeste Holm" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2027880270664200d-200wi" /></a>The next casting news did not come until January 26, 1948, when the press reported that Celeste Holm had "an important role in <em>Road House</em>". Holm was an ex-Broadway actor, most notable for originating the role of Ado Annie in the 1943 stage hit <em>Oklahoma</em>. In 1946, she signed a contract with 20th Century-Fox and did a couple  roles in relatively unnoticed musical films. By early 1948, however, she was receiving spectacular notices for her first dramatic role, in <em>Gentleman's Agreement</em>—including Academy Award talk as supporting actress. That film had been released just two months earlier in New York and Chicago and was still not released nationally.</p>

<p><em>Director Jean Negulesco</em></p>

<p>A director for <em>Road House</em> was finally found two weeks later. On February 11, Edwin Schallert of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported that 20th Century-Fox had signed Jean Negulesco to helm the movie. Negulesco was coming off eight years at Warner Brothers—most recently directing <em>Johnny Belinda</em>. During production of that film, Jack Warner became annoyed that Negulesco was taking too many pictorial shots. Hedda Hopper described the aftermath in her January 29 column: "Jean Negulesco brought in <em>Johnny Belinda</em> for $1,300,000—nearly $250,000 under budget. Then 10 days before Christmas, has was laid off by Warners and hasn't worked since. If that's gratitude, we should find a new meaning for the word. I'm told by those who have seen it that <em>Belinda</em> is one of the most sensitive, beautiful and artistic pictures ever made." </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1c5d200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1c5d200c img-responsive" style="width: 160px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Jean Negulesco" title="Jean Negulesco" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1c5d200c-200wi" /></a>Negulesco recalled, "After Warner gave me the sack, I was very sad and I thought of going back to painting and quit making films." Zanuck and 20th Century-Fox snapped up Negulesco in February and paid him $3000 a week, three times his previous salary. Negulesco told Hopper, "At the first producers' meeting, I thought I was being kidded when asked [by Zanuck], 'What can I do to make you happy? Just name it.'"</p>

<p>Lupino was no doubt pleased that Negulesco was on board. Her last film, <em>Deep Valley</em>, completed over a year earlier at Warner Brothers, was also directed by Negulesco. During that film, she was extremely happy working with Negulesco and his crew. She was reported saying that she wanted him to direct her next picture. She also stated that she would stay at Warners if they allowed her to choose her own directors. Her demands weren't met by Warners, yet Negulesco was indeed directing Lupino's next film—at 20th Century-Fox. Could Lupino have pulled strings with Zanuck behind the scenes? Interestingly, Negulesco recalls that Zanuck told him at their first meeting, "I've watched a film of yours that I liked a lot: <em>Deep Valley</em>."</p>

<p><em>Richard Widmark, aka 'Tommy Udo'</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9a1cedd200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9a1cedd200b img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo in 'Kiss of Death'" title="Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo in 'Kiss of Death'" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9a1cedd200b-300wi" /></a>In late February,  the two male leads were finalized, clearing the way for production to start within a few weeks. Hedda Hopper reported that Cornel Wilde and Richard Widmark would fill those roles. </p>

<p>Richard Widmark entered <em>Road House</em> on a career trajectory similar to Celeste Holm. He, too, was ex-Broadway actor and newcomer to Hollywood who was receiving huge plaudits for his most recently released film. Unlike Holm, Widmark's breakout had come in his very first film, <em>Kiss of Death</em>—the same film that raised Victor Mature's acting reputation in the late summer of 1947—where Widmark played the maniacal Tommy Udo, a character infamous for pushing a woman in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs. </p>

<p>Widmark was currently finishing up <em>The Street With No Name</em> as another murderer. In January, he had told Hedda Hopper, "This will be my last [such role]. I didn't come into pictures to be typed as a killer; I'm an actor—I hope." His transition away from psychopaths would take a bit longer, however, as his role in <em>Road House</em> would be similar.</p>

<p><em>Leading man Cornel Wilde</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278802706ea200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20278802706ea200d img-responsive" style="width: 160px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Cornel Wilde" title="Cornel Wilde" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278802706ea200d-200wi" /></a>Cornel Wilde, Lupino's new leading man in <em>Road House</em>, was one of 20th Century-Fox's top stars of the previous few years. He had already been in two films with Lupino—both before he hit the big time. In <em>High Sierra</em> (1941) he had a small role, while in <em>Life Begins at Eight-Thirty</em> (1942), he had been Lupino's love interest, with the top male role filled by Monty Woolley. </p>

<p>Wilde's breakthrough came in 1945 with the role of Frederic Chopin in the biopic <em>A Song to Remember</em>, for which he earned an Academy Award nomination as best actor. His most recent project had been <em>The Walls of Jericho</em> at 20th Century-Fox, with Linda Darnell, Anne Baxter and Kirk Douglas. After that completed, he spent a lot of his energy—unsuccessfully—trying to find a suitable Broadway play for him and his wife Patricia Knight. </p>

<p>The marriage of Wilde and Knight was on the volatile side, apparently, and attracted a lot of attention by the Hollywood press. The previous summer, Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times, discussing a temporary break up, wrote that their relationship was "considered one of the most celebrated of love idylls In Hollywood history". Wilde had also gotten a reputation related to his attempted promotion of his wife's career. In November 1947, Louella Parsons wrote that Humphrey Bogart "doesn't want to be another Cornel Wilde and get himself disliked at the studio or criticized in the press because he keeps asking for his bride as his movie partner." Parsons reassured Bogart, "I don't think your case and the Cornel Wilde case are in the least comparable. Betty [Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall] has already made a success and I never heard of your trying to push her."</p>

<p><em>A glittering cast</em></p>

<p>So by late February, 1948, the <em>Road House</em> lineup was full of celebrated stars. Darryl Zanuck was clearly not holding back. With top-billed Ida Lupino was one of 20th Century-Fox's top male box office stars and two of the hottest new supporting players. Director Negulesco said of <em>Road House</em>: "It's the finest cast I've ever had."</p>

<p>As the cast was finalized, Widmark and Holm both received Academy Award nominations for their supporting roles in their most recent films: <em>Kiss of Death</em> and <em>Gentleman's Agreement</em>, respectively.  Director Negulesco also had just had a breakout, award-nominated performance of his own— <em>Johnny Belinda</em>—though the full impact of that awaited its release later in 1948. He would receive an Academy Award nomination for best director the next year. </p>

<p>On March 10, The Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave their Golden Globe award for best supporting actress to Celeste Holm and their award for best male newcomer to Richard Widmark. Then, on March 20—two days before <em>Road House</em> started production—Holm won the Academy Award, while Widmark lost out to Edmund Gwenn for <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em>. <em>Road House</em> was starting on a high note for its supporting cast.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the next edition, which will cover the making of the film and its aftermath for Lupino, Wilde, Widmark, Holm, and Negulesco.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In the <a href="../../2021/02/a-forgotten-chapter-in-ida-lupinos-career.html">first edition</a> of the story of Ida Lupino's little-discussed first venture into film production, we left off in early February 1947. Lupino had concluded her contract at Warner Brothers and promptly formed an independent production company, Arcadia Productions, in partnership with Benedict Bogeaus. In this arrangement, she was to produce and star in one film a year over three years. </p>

<p>The 1947 Bogeaus-Lupino alliance is described as a "hasty partnership" in Donati's biography of Lupino, but as we saw, Lupino had put much time and effort over several years behind the decision to produce her own vehicles and take more creative control over her career. Additionally, as reported in <em>Showmens Trade Review</em> the same month Arcadia was formed, Lupino intended to produce films in which she was <em>not</em> the star. Her production designs extended beyond picking her own roles.</p>

<p><strong>Beginnings of Arcadia Productions</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9933be0200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9933be0200b img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino to Make Debut As Producer, Los Angeles Times, Apr. 27, 1947" title="Ida Lupino to Make Debut As Producer, Los Angeles Times, Apr. 27, 1947" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9933be0200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>In the early weeks of Arcadia, Lupino was spending her time in the desert, in Palm Springs—recovering from spiral meningitis obtained during the grueling shoot of <em>Deep Valley</em>, her last film at Warners. During this period, she and Bogeaus were considering numerous possibilities for her first film as producer. </p>

<p>A comedy called <em>New Years' Eve</em> was mentioned as Lupino's first project in the Louella Parsons article where the formation of Arcadia was first reported. Within days, though, a period drama, <em>The Queen's Necklace</em> became the reported choice. This film had been announced as a Lupino acting vehicle when she first signed with Bogeaus a year before. Now, Brian Aherne was mentioned as her potential co-star. Then, in March, a drama called <em>Celia</em> by Arch Oboler was purchased by Bogeaus and also became a candidate for Lupino's first Arcadia project. Clearly nothing was set in stone. In mid-March, press reports suggested they were three months away from starting filming on whatever project was decided upon.</p>

<p>At this same time, Lupino was recruiting a certain Broadway actor as her leading man. A reporter for the Hollywood Evening Citizen News wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She won't reveal his name because 'it wouldn't be fair to him if nothing should come of it'. But she's compiled a complete dossier on the gent, full of clippings and pictures. And if he lives up to his press clippings, she expects to bring his signature back on a contract. </p>
  
  <p>The big search is being made for her independent film with Ben Bogeaus, which the actress will start shortly after returning from the East. In spite of her interest in the unnamed New York actor, she is constantly looking out for someone in Hollywood who might fit the bill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it's not clear to me whether she ever made this New York recruiting trip or not, this is an early appearance of Lupino's ambition to foster new talent. This desire was the driving motivation in her subsequent producing efforts, where she helped launch the film acting careers of Sally Forrest, Mala Powers, Keefe Brasselle, Hugh O'Brian and others.</p>

<p><strong><em>Early Autumn</em></strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e39200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e39200b img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Early Autumn book cover" title="Early Autumn book cover" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e39200b-300wi" /></a>By the beginning of April, Lupino's first Arcadia project was finalized. Bogeaus purchased <em>Early Autumn</em>, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Louis Bromfield. This drama would provide a dual acting role for Lupino, as a mother of 40 and a girl of 18.  </p>

<p>The pace of activity at Arcadia now picked up, with the signing of Frances Robinson—a good friend of Lupino's—as story editor, the hiring of Dewitt Bodeen to write the screenplay, and the pursuit of King Vidor to direct. The quest for a leading man also continued, with Lupino and Bogeaus ardently pursuing both Arthur Kennedy and Robert Preston. Lupino reportedly also considered her ex-husband Louis Hayward.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lupino helped her new business partner by giving a dinner party on the Bogeaus lot for a number of prominent press representatives, then giving a screening of Bogeaus' newest production, <em>The Macomber Affair</em>. </p>

<p>By late April, the press was reporting on Ida Lupino's "debut as producer", while also noting her high demand as a leading actress. Columnist Erskine Johnson quoted her saying, "Bill Cagney [James Cagney's producer brother] came to me the other day and wondered in Producer Lupino would loan him Actress Lupino for a role in <em>The Time of Your Life</em>." Johnson continued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every agent in town is chasing her to hire their clients. She's just about ready to ask someone to proclaim a 'Be Kind to Producers Week'. And if all producers had such pretty legs, I'd proclaim it myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this activity at Arcadia on <em>Early Autumn</em> had been going on while Lupino was also studying for her U.S. citizenship exam, which she passed on the last day of April. Lupino's friend, columnist Hedda Hopper, used this occasion as an excuse to hype Lupino's career transformation over the years, from struggling ingenue to award-winning dramatic star to, now, "helping" Bogeaus produce <em>Early Autumn</em> and soon to "turn full producer".  Hopper separately reported that Lupino was planning to produce a film for Dorothy Lamour after completing her first for Bogeaus.</p>

<p>April 1947 was a momentous month in Lupino's life for another reason. While the press reported that she and Clark Gable were "sparking" and that Gable was wooing her with flowers, she turned down Gable's advances and instead took up with Warner Brothers executive, and aspiring writer and producer, Collier Young. She and Young were to marry in late 1948 and become partners in the next, far more successful, phase of Lupino's producing career—forming Emerald Productions in 1949 and re-constituting it as The Filmakers later that year.</p>

<p>With the anticipated June 1947 starting date of <em>Early Autumn</em> approaching, Lupino and Bogeaus continued to try to nail down the production. Lupino was also working on her potential second film at Arcadia, <em>The Queen's Necklace</em> and talking with Hurd Hatfield to be her leading man in that film.  Columnist Sheilah Graham reported that Lupino "says it's fun being a producer because every one loves her and every one wants her to give them a job!"</p>

<p>Talks continued through May with actors Arthur Kennedy, Robert Preston, and director King Vidor about <em>Early Autumn</em>, but nothing was formalized. Hopper once reported that Lupino had signed King Vidor to direct—but no one else picked that up, so it presumably was premature.</p>

<p>Soon, the axe fell on <em>Early Autumn</em>. Hedda Hopper broke the news on June 6:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ben Bogeaus tells me that since neither he nor Ida likes the script of "Early Autumn", they'll wait until they get a good one before making the picture. Meanwhile, Ida's free to make an outside film.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasons for the delay—and effective cancellation—were likely more complicated than Hopper's item suggested. Subsequent reports suggest Bogeaus' other commitments effectively squeezed out <em>Early Autumn</em>. His current production of <em>A Miracle Can Happen</em> (later retitled <em>On Our Merry Way</em>) had just had a troublesome preview and needed substantial re-shoots. And Bogeaus had a commitment to begin work on <em>Lulu Belle</em> on August 11, based on the loan-out agreement for its star Dorothy Lamour. As reported by <em>Film Bulletin</em>, the money coming as as part of the Lamour deal made it a top priority, as Bogeaus' only source of revenue at the time was <em>The Macomber Affair</em>.</p>

<p>Sheilah Graham needled Lupino in her column: "Being a producer isn't all it's cracked up to be, eh, Ida?" Graham also suggested Lupino was on the verge of returning to Warner Brothers "because the script of <em>Early Autumn</em> has her licked."</p>

<p>Warner Brothers was indeed ramping up efforts to woo her back—but without success. <em>Early Autumn</em> may have been moribund, but Producer Lupino was not. </p>

<p><strong><em>Miracle in the Rain</em></strong></p>

<p>Lupino then attempted to re-purchase her own screenplay, <em>Miss Pennington</em>—the one she had sold to RKO a couple years earlier (see the <a href="../../2021/02/a-forgotten-chapter-in-ida-lupinos-career.html">first edition</a> of this story for a reminder), but was unable to close that deal. Yet, in less than a month, Lupino had a new project underway. Louella Parsons wrote in her July 5 column:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ida Lupino, who recently put her feet under a desk as a woman producer for Ben Bogeaus, has selected her first. She will boss and star in "Miracle in the Rain", a Ben Hecht magazine story published about four years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e49200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e49200b img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Miracle In The Rain cover" title="Miracle In The Rain cover" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e49200b-250wi" /></a>Once again the publicity for Arcadia Productions kicked into gear. <em>Miracle in the Rain</em> was being adapted by Dwight Taylor. It would go into production as soon as the screenplay was ready. Lupino and Bogeaus again wanted King Vidor to direct. <em>Early Autumn</em> was still on the books as Lupino's second vehicle. Arcadia was still planning to produce pictures other than those starring Lupino. </p>

<p>Five weeks later, alas, this project was in dire straits as well—though most of the details do not appear to have made it into print. Lupino's choice for her leading man in <em>Miracle in the Rain</em> was Robert Walker—not yet famous for the creepy murderer in Alfred Hitchcock's <em>Strangers on a Train</em> (1951), but instead for romantic leads such as opposite Judy Garland in <em>The Clock</em> (1945). MGM, however, refused to loan him out—which Erskine Johnson reported left Walker "burning". Lupino's reaction is not documented.</p>

<p>Less than two weeks after that, on August 21, 1947, Hedda Hopper reported with little fanfare that <em>Miracle in the Rain</em> had been "postponed indefinitely". No reasons given; no excuses reported. </p>

<p>Producer Lupino was soon ready to throw in the towel. On September 3, Sheilah Graham wrote, "Ida Lupino and Benedict Bogeaus have called off their picture deal. They couldn't get together on story or price." And so Arcadia Productions was no more.</p>

<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>

<p>The last weeks of Arcadia was the period where Lupino's romance with Collier Young blossomed. Given their joint ambitions as filmmakers, Lupino may have become distracted by new goals—both personal and professional. That is what is suggested in the Donati biography.</p>

<p>Some hints as to Lupino's view of her experience an attempted producer in 1947 come from later comments. In April, 1948, Bob Thomas reported her saying about producing</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never again! I passed up four pictures while I was working myself practically to death on a film that was never made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, a decade later, long after she had become a successful producer-director-writer, she was asked about the beginnings of her next attempt at an independent production company on the <em>This Is Your Life</em> television program. She said to the host, "Let me, you know, put myself completely in the clear. I did not want to become a producer." Then she laughed and added, "They're very badly-treated people." Her real goal in starting Emerald Productions and The Filmakers was discovering new talent.</p>

<p>Could it be that her disinclination to return to producing was the result of her experiences in 1947? After all, even early in her Arcadia tenure, she had said she was ready to declare a "Be Kind to Producers Week".</p>

<p>Going back to the late summer of 1947, Lupino did not let this failure as a first-time producer stop her. Even as she was shutting down Arcadia, she was hard at work piecing together her next acting gig. She had already picked a story, <em>The Dark Love</em>. Through the arrangements of her and her agent with 20th Century-Fox, this would soon become the noir classic <em>Road House</em> (1948). </p>

<p>A few months after that, despite her vow of "Never again!", she would be producing independent films—this time using unknown actors she discovered—and this time with unforgettable results.</p>

<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>

<p><em>Early Autumn</em> never made it into movie form. Ben Bogeaus made another attempt to produce it in 1956, retitled <em>Conquest</em>, but again nothing came of it.</p>

<p><em>Miracle in the Rain</em> passed through several hands before being made at Warner Brothers in 1955, starring Jane Wyman and Van Johnson, directed by Rudolf Maté.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>This is the story of a non-legendary chapter in a legendary career—the story of Ida Lupino's first attempt to become a film producer in Hollywood. It was a frustrating experience that set the stage for her later triumphs.</p>

<p>The legendary part of Lupino's story is that, in 1949, she left her career as an established Hollywood movie star to become the driving force behind an independent production company—eventually known as "The Filmakers". There, with collaborators Collier Young and Malvin Wald, she wrote, produced, and directed low-budget films, initially starring unknown actors, that told stories the major studios of the time were not addressing. </p>

<p>Less known is that Lupino's first attempt to move behind-the-scenes into film production came two years earlier. This chapter of the Lupino story is typically ignored in overviews of her career. Even the comprehensive biography by William Donati devotes only a single paragraph to it.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98cc1ee200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98cc1ee200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino portrait, circa 1945" title="Ida Lupino portrait, circa 1945" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98cc1ee200b-250wi" /></a>For this initial effort as producer, her approach was very different from her later one. Her goal was to produce films at the same level as the major studios with herself as the star—continuing her acting career, but with creative control. After many months of hard work through most of 1947, she was left with no visible accomplishments. Yet it is likely that from this discouraging episode, she learned lessons that helped make her later creative efforts successful—and that immortalized her career.</p>

<p>To set the stage, let's begin a couple years earlier—January 1945. The end of the all-consuming war was in sight, Lupino's six-year marriage had recently broken up, and Lupino was emerging from that emotional trauma contemplating her life. </p>

<p>At the age of 27, Lupino claimed she was "flummoxed" about her career and seriously considering a major change. At the time, she was a Hollywood veteran of over a decade, at the height of her fame, with a stellar reputation as one of the top dramatic actresses in the industry. But, as she told columnist Erskine Johnson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I'll go berserk if I'm still dashing around at 30 [getting up at 5 o'clock every morning making myself look beautiful and then rushing to the studio]. 
  I have a time now making myself look good—and I've got a voice like Wallace Beery's."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She had long known that her time at the top would be limited, and that she needed alternatives in order to survive in Hollywood when her leading actress days were over. Her present plan was to give up acting and become a full-time writer.</p>

<p>Her acting contract with Warner Brothers still had two more years to go. Over those two years, she used her down time to sample various plans for the next phase of her career. She worked on several screenplays, often in collaboration with others—notably her ex-husband, actor Louis Hayward, and actress Barbara Read. In early 1946, Lupino sold one of her screenplays to RKO—<em>Miss Pennington</em>—for $20,000.</p>

<p>Music was another major effort, building on what had been a passion of hers for years. She wrote numerous songs, by herself and in collaboration with Nick Arden and William MacIlwinen. In the spring of 1946, she and MacIlwinen undertook to get a musical stage show produced on Broadway. Lupino took a three-month leave-of-absence from her Warners contract to push this project to completion. Unfortunately, it did not come to fruition as a Broadway show; however, it was eventually produced at a smaller venue in 1949. (See this <a href="../../2020/05/ida-lupinos-apple-tree-farm.html">earlier article</a> for more on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>.)</p>

<p>Another approach was to continue acting, but to produce her own films. For Lupino, who had been battling studio executives for years over scripts, the lure of creative freedom beckoned. Initially she contemplated a co-producing-acting partnership with ex-husband Hayward, with whom she remained friendly and who also had self-producing ambitions. </p>

<p>But she went a different route. Enter independent producer Benedict Bogeaus. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202788011e862200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202788011e862200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Producer Benedict Bogeaus with wife, actress Dolores Moran, circa 1950s" title="Producer Benedict Bogeaus with wife, actress Dolores Moran, circa 1950s" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202788011e862200d-250wi" /></a>Ben Bogeaus was a businessman who had made a lot of money in the early years of the war, and then, in 1944, moved to Hollywood to produce films. Bogeaus' movies had name stars and respectable budgets. His company had already released three films by the end of 1945, and his ambitions were expanding. In January 1946, Lupino—with a year left on her Warners contract—signed on to star in one of Bogeaus' pictures. Initially there was no mention of her producing.</p>

<p>At this same time, Lupino claimed that she would be willing to extend her time with Warners <em>if</em> they let her pick stories and directors. While Warners likely would never cede so much control, this indicates Lupino's producing ambition had solidified. In March, 1946, it became explicit. Lupino told Hedda Hopper, "I'd like to get into writing and producing. Acting is too tortuous."</p>

<p>As the Broadway hopes for her stage show slipped away, her next Warner Brothers film suffered delays, and the one with Bogeaus was on hold, Lupino continued her writing work on music and screenplays, while also enjoying a newfound passion for sailing.</p>

<p>Late in 1946, she revealed to the press that one of the sticking points in her negotiations with Warner Brothers was that she wanted the right to independently produce one picture a year—"<em>which I've already contracted to do</em>" (emphasis added). This is the first sign I have found that her deal with Bogeaus had extended from acting into producing. She also said that she was comparing notes on the challenges of being a producer with friend and fellow actor-turned-producer John Garfield.</p>

<p>Lupino left her longtime studio in early 1947, refusing to sign the long-term exclusive contract Warners insisted on. Within days of completing her last film at Warners, <em>Deep Valley</em>, Lupino, along with Bogeaus, announced the formation of a new company to house their joint effort—a company separate from Bogeaus' own. Louella Parsons wrote on Feb. 5, 1947:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those swanky new offices being redecorated on the Ben Bogeaus lot are for Ida Lupino, who moves over to General Service Studio [Bogeaus' lot at the time] as a producer as well as star.</p>
  
  <p>She and Ben have formed the Arcadia Productions, with Ida set for one film a year for the next three years. </p>
  
  <p>Ida's first is a comedy, "New Year's Eve", an original story by Norman Reilly Raine. 
  Ida plays an heiress who gets kidnaped on New Year's Eve by a prize fighter and a G.I. and the complications that ensue can be imagined. </p>
  
  <p>I'll say for Bogeaus that he tries to keep his stars happy by letting them have their say about their movies. Gregory Peck has a "piece" of "Macomber Affair" 
  and Burgess Meredith is co-producer of "A Miracle Can Happen" and several other pictures he's made with Ben.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over much of the succeeding year, Ida Lupino would devote her prodigious energies to her new role as producer of her own films. We will see how that turned out in the next edition.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>While I am trying to ready a longer piece, here is a short post featuring guest columnist Ida Lupino. </p>

<p>She was filling in for the regular columnist of the Hollywood Citizen-News on July 27, 1945. At this time, Lupino had recently returned from nearly two months touring the northeastern U.S.—mostly visiting hospitals of the war wounded, and also making some publicity appearances for her just-released comedy, <em>Pillow to Post</em>. She was about to start work on her next film, <em>The Man I Love</em>. </p>

<p>Late in her trip she had injured herself and then collapsed from exhaustion due to the busy schedule during a heat wave. The memory of this "abominable climate" was clearly near the top of her mind when she returned to California.</p>

<p>A brief excerpt from a serious portion of this generally light-hearted essay:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The war in Europe ended while I was away from Hollywood. 
  Only in the hospitals I visited, particularly those mental wards I mentioned, the war isn't over.
  It isn't going to be over for some of those men—ever.
  I'm going visiting that was again, quite soon I hope and I think that every Hollywood player who can go is needed now as ever before.
  We are going to be needed, too, to add whatever gayety and relaxation we can
  for the sick and wounded for a long, long time to come.</p>
