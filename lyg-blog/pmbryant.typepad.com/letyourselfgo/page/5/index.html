<p>Ann Sperber and Eric Lax's biography <em>Bogart</em> is a fabulous book on the life and career of one of the most important Hollywood figures of the 20th century. The book is weighted towards Humphrey Bogart's nearly twenty years with Warner Bros., due to the extensive research done in that studio's archives. That is an understandable focus given the importance of those years and the films Bogart made in that period. The other parts of his life, particularly his Broadway and early Hollywood years, get less detailed attention, but are still significantly covered. I can’t recommend this strongly enough for anyone interested in the classic Hollywood era, in general, and Humphrey Bogart, in particular.</p>

<p>I listened to the audiobook version of <em>Miss D &amp; Me</em>, read by the author, Kathryn Cermak. Cermak was a personal assistant and later friend and surrogate daughter to Bette Davis, starting in 1979. As insight into the final decade of Bette Davis’ life, this book is excellent and unique. Critical happenings during this period include Davis‘ stroke and prolonged recovery, aided by Cermak; Davis’ daughter's betrayal of her mother via her slanderous book; plus Davis’ final trip and death in France. Cermak provides much insight into these events, plus the film work that Davis was doing during this period. I was less interested in Cermak’s diversion into her own aborted romance, but it does have some relevance to her relationship with Davis, so I understand why Cermak included it.</p>

<p><em>Miss D &amp; Me</em> is a worthwhile book for anyone interested in the last decade of Bette Davis’ life and career. Davis' personality really shines through.</p>

Its stars are now virtually forgotten. Ida Lupino, the third lead, is well-remembered—though primarily for her post-1940 acting career and as a groundbreaking woman director in Hollywood. Her stint at Paramount in the 1930s is neglected.</p>

<p>The story of the production of <em>Paris in Spring</em> begins in late 1934 as the teenage Ida Lupino was on a several-month vacation in her native London, taking time-off after an eventful first year in Hollywood. In November 1934, Paramount purchased an unproduced stage play called <em>Two on a Tower</em> as the second film vehicle for opera singer and actress Mary Ellis, who they were attempting to build into a movie star. </p>

<p>With Ellis in <em>Two on a Tower</em>, the studio aimed to replicate  Columbia's success with opera singer Grace Moore in <em>One Night of Love</em> (1934). Lewis Milestone (<em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> 1930, <em>The Front Page</em> 1931) was soon brought in as director. <em>Two on a Tower</em> was planned to be one of the studio's more prominent productions of 1935. </p>

<p>Initially, early-career Cary Grant was considered for the male lead. But Paramount decided to go in a different direction. Shortly after the year began, they signed Tullio Carminati for that role. He had starred opposite Grace Moore in <em>One Night of Love</em>, so this was another building block in replicating that success. Carminati understood he was a key part, as he held out for "plenty of money". Dorothy Parker was brought in to help write dialogue and lyrics for the film. (She did not end up in the final credits.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be40d102e200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be40d102e200d img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino, glamour shot on set of Paris in Spring" title="Ida Lupino, glamour shot on set of Paris in Spring" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be40d102e200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>At this point Ida Lupino, Paramount's young ingenue star from England, enters the story.  She was cast as the second female lead behind Ellis and Carminati. Her first three roles in Hollywood had all been leads, but those were less prestigious productions.</p>

<p>Ida was very young—she would turn 17 in early February. A veteran of prominent roles in several British films, she had signed with Paramount in the summer of 1933 and moved to Hollywood with her mother Connie. She was the most talked-about candidate in the highly-publicized search for the role of Alice in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. Ida did not get the part, but the studio nonetheless decided to promote the young actress as an up-and-coming star. They cast her in leading roles in three films released in 1934.  Over the summer, Ida had a few scary weeks recovering from an attack of infantile paralysis—polio. The studio delayed production of her next film until she recovered. After that, Ida decided to take time off to visit her father and sister in England. The studio agreed to let her take a leave for a few months.</p>

<p>In mid-January 1935, Ida arrived back in the United States aboard the Olympic with her mother and younger sister Rita, with the press reporting that she would be starting work on <em>Two on a Tower</em> immediately on her arrival in Hollywood a few days later. When she did get back to Hollywood, she was widely reported saying, "Four months abroad impressed me with the fact that I am first a Southern Californian and second an English woman," and expressing a desire for American citizenship.</p>

<p>By late January, work on the picture was underway. New York Daily News columnist Sidney Skolsky visited the set and reported that Ida looked more beautiful than before her trip to England, was as excited as a movie fan to meet Mary Ellis, and somehow had lost her heavy English accent. Ida, already well-known for playing bad-girl roles, said, "It's funny, me getting such a goody, goody role." She also said, "I fell in love, really in love for the first time, while I was in London... And now I'm to get a chance to prove I'm an actress."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bde8e4535200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bde8e4535200c img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino and Tullio Carminati in the opening scene from Paris in Spring" title="Ida Lupino and Tullio Carminati in the opening scene from Paris in Spring" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bde8e4535200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The film was a musical comedy with several operetta-style songs—all sung by Mary Ellis, though Carminati chimes in with a few verses in one of them. The original name of <em>Two on a Tower</em> came from the opening scene, where Carminati rides to the top of the Eiffel Tower feigning a desire to leap off of it, as Ellis' character has rebuffed his marriage proposals. At the top, Carminati encounters Ida Lupino's character, who appears to be more seriously attempting the same thing. Their encounter is about as charming as a double-suicide meet-cute can be. Their suicide plans are called off in an embrace, and they commence scheming to win back their true loves. For me, this charming scene is the highlight of the movie. </p>

<p>Soon, the name <em>Two on a Tower</em> had been dropped in favor of the more generic, but presumably more salable, <em>Paris in Spring</em>. The elaborate sets used in the film for the nightclub and the massive French country house indicate that Paramount was not skimping on this production. Press reports said the set was one of the largest at the studio. An item in <em>Variety</em> in June said that of recent Paramount pictures, <em>Paris in Spring</em> had the highest production cost—$800,000.</p>

<p>Rumors of a potential romance between Ida and director Lewis Milestone hit the papers in February—they were seen together many nights at various night spots. Both denied anything more than friendship. Ida was reportedly also dating actor Richard Cromwell. On March 9, Louella Parsons published an item: "Cary Grant, the object of many women's attention, beauing Ida Lupino." </p>

<p>Ida's January comments about becoming more Californian than English must have caused a stir in her native country, as in March, she was doing damage control: "[Ida Lupino] feels extremely grateful for the opportunities afforded her in this country but would consider renouncing her rights as an Englishwoman in the same way most people would think of desertion from the army."</p>

All three leads came through with gifts for the crew, which was unusual enough to merit press attention. Mary Ellis then sailed for England to appear in a play, planning to return to Paramount late in the year for another musical. Carminati gave Ida a small watch for "being a good little girl".</p>

<p>Around this same time, Ida started spending time with the famous  millionaire, film producer, and aviator, Howard Hughes. In early April, they were photographed in Palm Springs together, and by mid-April, Ida had to issue a denial of impending marriage: "We are very, very, VERY good friends, but that is all." Her dates with Hughes, all chaperoned by her mother according to Ida's later recollections, appear to have ceased not long after.</p>

<p>In early May, Ida was invited by Jackie Coogan, the child star of Charlie Chaplin's <em>The Kid</em> on a weekend outing but declined. The trip resulted in a horrendous automobile accident that killed four people in the car, including teenage actor Trent "Junior" Durkin, and severely injured Coogan, the only survivor.</p>

<p>After this tragedy, she was back working in her next pictures at Paramount: <em>Peter Ibbetson</em>, another supporting role in a prestigious production—this one starring Gary Cooper and Ann Harding; and <em>Smart Girl</em>, a comic-drama programmer where she was the lead.</p>

<p>The first public preview of <em>Paris in Spring</em> was held in San Bernardino on May 20. Ida and Lewis Milestone attended along with numerous other representatives from Paramount; Carminati and Ellis are not mentioned. (Of course Ellis was in England by this point.) The official release of the film was a week later, and it generally received favorable, though lukewarm, reviews. </p>

<p>The vast majority of reviewers' attention, almost all quite positive, was focused on Mary Ellis. Ida Lupino was not mentioned in depth by many. One reviewer for the New York Daily News, after a glowing discussion of Ellis, wrote: "Ida Lupino, who has obviously been to a new beauty parlor as well as to a new school of dramatics, where in the first she has acquired a superior pulchritude and in the second a bigger and better acting sense." A Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote that "It is Ida Lupino who offers the surprise performance, however. She plays with humor and charm and projects personality for the first time." (This seems overly harsh on Ida's earlier performances, especially in <em>Ready for Love</em> (1934) and her British films of 1933.) Modern Screen magazine wrote about the supporting players, "The lad [James Blakeley] can act. So can Ida Lupino." They added, "Ida Lupino's about as interesting a movie starlet as you'll find out there."</p>

<p>At the box office, the appeal of <em>Paris in Spring</em> appears to have been limited, though I haven't found any concrete evidence of how it performed. Despite the mixed-to-positive reviews, a handful of exhibitor comments in the <em>Motion Picture Herald</em> in the second half of 1935 are mostly negative. One of the harsher ones said, "Many of our patrons decided they did not care to visit 'Paris in Spring'". The film had started its descent into obscurity.</p>

<p>As for the players, Mary Ellis returned to Paramount later in 1935 and did only one more film there, <em>Fatal Lady</em> (1936). She continued her long career on the London stage afterwards. She lived to the age of 105, dying in 2003. Her autobiography, <em>Those Dancing Years</em>, was published in 1982. In the book, she refers to <em>Paris in Spring</em> as <em>Paris Love Song</em>, and says "working in it was one of the most enjoyable times I ever had".</p>

<p>Tullio Carminati did a substantial number of films in Europe over the rest his career. His subsequent Hollywood film appearances after <em>Paris in Spring</em> were rare, but he did have a supporting role in the well-known romantic comedy <em>Roman Holiday</em> in 1953.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino continued at Paramount for a few more years—growing  increasingly unsatisfied with the types of roles she was getting—before abruptly leaving the studio in late 1937. After a career crisis, she broke into stardom at Warner Bros. in 1940, spending most of the next decade as an acting star before transitioning to writing, producing, and directing films—and later television. </p>

<p>In Ida Lupino's brief memoir, edited and published posthumously by Mary Ann Anderson, there is no mention of <em>Paris in Spring</em>.</p>

(I originally posted a variant of this on Goodreads.)</p>
<p>This is an invaluable window into the life and times of a fascinating, but very troubled, man. The writing is excellent, if a bit scattershot. But that’s Levant&#39;s style, and his acerbic yet hilarious personality shines through. To get the most out of this book, it helps to have a passing familiarity with or interest in the Hollywood and classical music scene of the 1920s-1950s, and perhaps the television scene of the 1960s. If you do have any interest in those scenes, read this book!</p>

This brief review is my contribution to the Classic Film Reading Challenge, run by Raquel Stecher of the <a href="http://www.outofthepastblog.com/"><em>Out of the Past</em></a> blog. (I originally posted a variant of this on Goodreads.)</p>

<p>I started reading the Kindle book but switched to the audiobook after a couple chapters. This is extremely well researched and well-written. In fact, I think it is an essential book for anyone interested in the golden age of Hollywood. The Hollywood connection stretches from Herman's beginning as a writer in the 1920s to the end of Joe's career as producer-writer-director in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Both of the brothers, Herman and Joe Mankiewicz, come across as pompous asses, but they are fascinating and important characters. Joe’s patronizing and disrespectful attitude toward the women in his profession is an indication of how tough women had it in Hollywood at the time (and still, no doubt). This is especially true since I get the impression that, as bad as he was, Joe may have been one of the better of the Hollywood power players on that front.</p>

<p>The chapter on <em>Cleopatra</em> is fascinating all by itself, and the humbled Joe that emerged from that experience was a more appealing version of his character.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b img-responsive" alt="Bogart.SperberLax.Cover" title="Bogart.SperberLax.Cover" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>A few weeks ago I started reading my first biography of Humphrey Bogart. This book was written by Ann Sperber and Eric Lax, published in the late '90s, and appears to be very thoroughly researched—especially regarding anything that happened at Warner Bros. So I was curious if they mentioned anything about the dog in <em>High Sierra</em> and his relationship to Bogart.</p>

<p>Given my <a href="../../2020/05/pard-the-dog-frm-high-sierra-was-it-really-bogarts-dog.html">earlier research</a> that uncovered that Zero, the dog that played Pard, was not owned by Bogart at the time of filming <em>High Sierra</em>, I was not expecting to find anything in this thoroughly-documented biography. But, in fact, there actually is a mention of Zero in this book, and he is specified as Bogart's dog! </p>

<p>This was troubling to me. My research, based on contemporary newspaper articles, seemed highly unlikely to be outright incorrect. So I quickly turned to the end notes to try to find out the source for this brief mention.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="display: inline;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d img-responsive" alt="ZeroBogartFootnote.SperberLax" title="ZeroBogartFootnote.SperberLax" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d-500wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Ida Lupino!</p>

<p>That was certainly a surprise. She said this in a 1991 interview with author Ann Sperber, over 50 years after the filming of the movie. Given the time that had passed, and the lack of corroboration from sources of 1941, it seems clear this is a case of Lupino misremembering. </p>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="../../2020/05/pard-the-dog-from-high-sierra-was-it-really-bogarts-dog.html">earlier post</a>, a newspaper story from 1941 had reported, second-hand, that Bogart sought (unsuccessfully) to purchase Zero the dog after the movie. If I may speculate, maybe that was true, maybe Bogart talked during the filming about a desire to own Zero, and maybe, over many decades, that became, in Lupino's mind, that Bogart actually owned Zero.</p>

<p>Due to the solid reputation of the Sperber-Lax biography of Bogart, could it be the original source of all the rumors about Bogart's ownership of Zero that have been repeated so often in internet writings and other sources over the last decade or so? I am inclined to believe so for the time being—pending further discoveries, of course.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Recently a wonderful, if brief, 1972 interview with Ida Lupino was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SF53ECpj1k">posted on YouTube</a>. This interview was part of the publicity surrounding the release of the film <em>Junior Bonner</em>. </p>

<p>The video is from the archives of a long-time television reporter named Bobbie Wygant. The sound quality drops in two or three places for a few seconds, but is mostly decipherable in those places with some effort. So I took the time to transcribe it for posterity and to save others the effort of trying to interpret the words in the tough spots.</p>

<p>Television interviews of Lupino are extremely hard to find these days. In fact, other than the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UgbgrLve7A&amp;t=16s">1958 <em>This is Your Life</em></a> episode, this is the only non-scripted television appearance of Lupino's that I've seen. So this is a real treasure!</p>

<p>Here is the transcript.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p><strong>Bobbie Wygant</strong>: As I said in the introduction, Miss Ida Lupino is returning to the motion picture screen after a 17-year absence. So Miss Lupino, it just has to be the first question—what was it about this role of Elvira that tempted you back to the screen?</p>

<p><strong>Ida Lupino</strong>: Well first of all my agents said, ‘We want to send a script over to you. Mr. Joe Wizan is producing it. Mr Sam Peckinpah is directing it. Steve McQueen and Robert Preston are starring in it and would you like to play Steve McQueen’s mother?’ And without reading the script, I said, ‘I’ll play his grandmother!’  (Laughter) With that lineup—most definitely.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Well I’ve seen the picture and you’d have to have lots and lots of makeup to play his grandmother. I can tell you that.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Well I wouldn’t say that. You’re very kind.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: No, I’ve seen the picture. Now, the other thing that I would like to know is that -- the first day you went back on the set, were you at all nervous about it, Miss Lupino?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Oh yes, very, very. I think when you’ve been back of the camera for a long time and you haven’t made a motion picture for so long, there’s that natural nervousness, you know—your first day and… first couple of days.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: What were you shooting that first day on the set?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Well, actually, I was very lucky. It was the rodeo stuff. (Laughs) And I didn’t do much except stand in crowds and wave to my husband Robert Preston, who plays Ace Bonner. And who is marvelous in it.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: I’ll drink to that. He is, indeed.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: [?] I didn’t say that.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: You’ve been directing and writing for some 17 years now. When you first wanted to be a director, was it a difficult thing to convince people that you could and to give you a chance?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Well, actually I never wanted to be a director. It was just an accident. I had co-written a screenplay for a picture called ‘Not Wanted’ and was co-producing it. And our director unfortunately had a heart attack suddenly. But it had to be made for 125 thousand dollars in ten days. And we couldn’t afford another director. So I took over. Fortunately for us the picture was a success. I said, well that’s fine. I’ll go home and write some lyrics and music—which I like to do! And… but the moneymen said no, I had to direct the second one. And then it was like a snowball and you know, it kept on. And then Howard Hughes took over our company, and he insisted I direct the first three with RKO. And that’s how this ugly thing happened of me getting in back of the camera.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: But when you took over, Miss Lupino, that is really an about-face for an actress, isn’t it? You’ve been in front of the camera, but then it’s a whole ‘nother world in back of the camera, isn’t it?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Yes, a whole ‘nother world. A very good world, though. There’s a lot of nice people.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: It wasn’t a difficult adjustment for you?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Yes, I was terrified. Absolutely terrified. I was never off the phone with our editor saying ‘Have I got him coming in the room in the right direction? Is she looking in the right direction?’ I was like a bird trying, you know, trying to fly for the first time—</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Did you make any goofs?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: I made so many, I can’t even enumerate. (Laughs) But you mean on the first picture?</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Oh yeah I was always calling him up and saying, ‘You know I think I’ve reversed myself here.’ And he’d say, ‘Yes you have’. So I’d have to quickly shoot it over again.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: I’m sure you’re not the first director that’s done that––</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: You know, directions in camera––</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Yes. Now. You surely… Of all the motion pictures you’ve made, Miss Lupino, there are some that you would probably like to be remembered for more than others. Which are the ones you’d most like to be remembered for?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: You mean as an actress or director?</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: As an actress, uhuh, as an actress.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: There are so many I want to forget. (Laughter)</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Do you care to name any of those? (Laughs)</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Nooo, I’d rather not. I’d rather not.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Then the ones you’d really like to be remembered for—which ones?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: As a performer, well there’s only one I really cared enough about—that I thought I was half-way decent in, and that was a thing called “Ladies in Retirement”.  It was a New York stage play and I did —(?)—. And I thought I gave a fairly decent performance. And I didn’t shudder when I saw myself—for a change! (Laughs)</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Who were the other people in that?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: It was Elsa Lanchester. And Edith Barrett. Louis Hayward. Evelyn Keyes. And me playing the murderess.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Miss Lupino, I know you have to go now and dress for the new world premiere tonight—. I do thank you for taking the time to talk with us. And please, don’t stay away for another 17 years, will you?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: No, I won’t. If Mr Wizar will have me back playing a grandmother or an aunt, I’d be delighted! (Laughs)</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Thank you very much, Miss Ida Lupino.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Recently I uncovered some fascinating information on a forgotten aspect of Ida Lupino's multi-faceted career. Aside from her well-known contributions as a film and television actor, writer, producer, and director, she also co-authored a musical comedy that was <em>produced on stage</em> in 1949. </p>

<p>The stage production was the revelation, since it appears to have gone down a memory black hole. I have not seen such a production mentioned in any of the books and articles I have read about Ida over the last few years, even those by her biographers.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino had serious ambitions to write and produce a stage musical comedy, and she had worked quite a bit in that direction in the 1930s and '40s in her spare time. So it is pleasing to discover that this ambition of hers was realized, adding another item to long list of her show business accomplishments.</p>

<p>My presumption that none of Ida's stage musical works had been produced was based in part on <a href="https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/03/27/apple-tree-farm-a-script-by-stanley-lupino-with-revisions-by-ida-lupino/">a 2014 article</a> by MoMA associate curator Anne Morra — an informative article about a script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> that MoMA had recently acquired. At the end, Morra relates that "<em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was never realized as a stage or screen musical". </p>

<p>From my own readings, I knew <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was the play that Ida was most determined to see produced. She had taken time off from acting and spent several months of 1946 — near the height of her Hollywood stardom — with the lofty ambition of getting it to Broadway. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-classic-hollywood-lupino-centennial-20180216-story.html" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20264e2dd9ce3200d img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Stanley and Ida Lupino in 1935 (LA Times)" title="Stanley and Ida Lupino in 1935 (LA Times)" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20264e2dd9ce3200d-450wi" /></a>This play was something she clearly cared deeply about. Ida's late father Stanley had written the original book, and there was no one Ida was more determined to please than him. Her attempt to adapt Stanley's book, write a score, and produce the play may have been a way to honor him after his early death in 1942. Morra mentions that Stanley's script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was the only script that Ida retained to the end of her life. </p>

<p>Ida Lupino's push to make <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> a reality on the stage may have begun in 1943, the year after her father's death. Late that year, an item in <em>Photoplay</em> magazine relates, "Ida, by the way, is working hard on that musical comedy (she wrote all the music for it) she expects to stage very soon. Producer Lupino! Not bad." This item is consistent with <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>, though there is a chance it could be something else — she dabbled in music constantly at that time.</p>

<p>Events in Ida's personal life likely distracted her soon after that. Her husband, Louis Hayward, returned from the South Pacific a war hero, but devastated by his experiences. Helping him recover, then dealing with the break-up of their marriage in subsequent months took virtually all her energy. </p>

<p><em>Apple Tree Farm</em> doesn't re-emerge as a public priority for Ida until she was working on the film <em>Escape Me Never</em> with Errol Flynn in late 1945 and early '46. At that time, she energetically resumed work on the musical comedy. The press reported that she had written music and lyrics for five numbers and was aiming for it to be on Broadway in the fall.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino and Bill MacIlwinen work on Apple Tree Farm (Chicago Tribune, 1948)" title="Ida Lupino and Bill MacIlwinen work on Apple Tree Farm (Chicago Tribune, 1948)" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b-450wi" /></a>Around this same time, she had invited several men and women to share her household due to the post-war housing shortage. One of these, a war veteran named Bill MacIlwinen, was a talented musician, and in him, Ida found a willing and able collaborator on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>.</p>

<p>In a March 9 column, Hedda Hopper wrote that Ida was taking a three-month leave-of-absence from making pictures at Warner Bros. in order to work on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. She would "adapt it for American audiences and to collaborate on the score with an ex-soldier". Ida planned to have a cast of "unknowns" and to do a tryout on the west coast before taking it to Broadway. </p>

<p>A week later, another Hollywood columnist said Ida was "working like mad" with Bill MacIlwinen. They were expecting to finish in late April, after which they would go to New York City to sell it to Broadway. Late in March, Louella Parsons wrote that "Warners have taken an option on Ida Lupino's musical, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>, for a movie. It's all ready for its Santa Barbara tryout." </p>

<p>Next, the Hollywood press reported that "Ida has signed radio comedian Jackson McCarthy to play in it," and that she and MacIlwinen had fourteen musical numbers written for the play. Singer Tony Martin was said to be ready to try out a couple of the songs on his radio show. (I would be fascinated to know if this actually happened.)</p>

<p>So as of April 1946, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> appeared to be on track for a production in Santa Barbara in the near future. Ida and Bill were proud of their work, as columnist Erskine Johnson discovered while vising the "Lupino Asylum", as Ida referred to her household, on "a rather dull afternoon", with only 10 or 12 people there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I want you to meet Bill MacIlwinen," Ida said. "He was a lieutenant in the Navy. Now we're collaborating on a Broadway musical — 'Apple Tree Farm'. Bill is writing the music, and I'm writing the lyrics. Listen! — he's playing the piano in the living room now."</p>
  
  <p>We listened. Bill was an excellent pianist.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>"You must hear some of our songs from 'Apple Tree Farm'," Ida said. We all rushed into the living room. Bill played and Ida sang.</p>
  
  <p>"My sister's husband is designing the hats for the show," Ida said, after singing four numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next on the agenda was Ida's New York sales trip, scheduled for May 7.</p>

<p>Then something happened — at the last minute, Ida Lupino postponed her trip. </p>

<p>The reported reason for the cancellation was a "serious throat ailment". Soon,  columnist Edwin Schallert expressed doubt that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> would go further any time soon, as Ida was going to be too busy with film work. One of the films Schallert mentioned for Ida never happened, while the other, <em>Deep Valley</em>, didn't end up going before the cameras for four months.</p>

<p>On June 4, columnist Harrison Carroll reported, "Ida Lupino will do a complete re-write on the book of her musical <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. She plans to publish several songs in the meantime." </p>

<p>At that point, at least in the press, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> goes dark.</p>

<p>Six months later, by which time Ida Lupino was starring in <em>Deep Valley</em>, a United Press article about the madhouse of assorted people at Ida's home quotes her saying she is working on a musical for which "the play was written by my father." Signs of life? Or old news?</p>

<p>Another eighteen months — then, in April 1948, a Chicago Tribune layout on Ida includes an undated photograph of her working with Bill MacIlwinen on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. Again, is this signs of life or an old picture? </p>

<p>By late 1948, Ida had married Collier Young, and her household reverted to that of a traditional couple — no longer a motley assortment of people coming and going. Soon, she and Young would be writing and producing their own movies. The time for a stage production of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> had come and gone — or so I would have thought.</p>

<p>But then, on January 28, 1949, just a few days after Ida announced her plans to produce a film about unwed mothers for her independent company — the film that became <em>Not Wanted</em> and launched her celebrated directing career — an item appears in the Raleigh News and Observer with the headline "Ida Lupino's Play Will Be Presented":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chapel Hill, Jan. 27 — "Apple Tree Farm", an original play by Stanley and Ida Lupino of Hollywood, with music by Bill McIlwinnen [sic] of Fayetteville, will go into production next week on the University of North Carolina campus. </p>
  
  <p>The modern musical fantasy will be given here April 4, 5, 6, under the sponsorship of the Laboratory theatre of the Carolina Playmakers for the benefit of the Koch Memorial Fund.</p>
  
  <p>Martin Jacobs of Greensboro, who staged last year's first Memorial Fund show, "Sweep It Clean," will again be director.</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino, the famous movie star, has indicated she expects to attend the performance in Chapel Hill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amazing news!</p>

<p>As I examined the newspaper archives from North Carolina as the April production date approached, I was concerned. Did this actually happen? Did something arise to prevent it?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Apple Tree Farm rehearsal (Daily Tar Heel, Apr 6, 1949)" title="Apple Tree Farm rehearsal (Daily Tar Heel, Apr 6, 1949)" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b-450wi" /></a>But nothing got in the way — it actually happened! The original planned run of three nights was extended to five: April 4-8, 1949.</p>

<p>Ida was unable to attend the performance due to her duties on her film, <em>Not Wanted</em>, which now included directing due to the illness of the assigned director, Elmer Clifton. She did do an interview on a CBS coast-to-coast broadcast the day before the premiere in North Carolina. And she and her friend Harry Mines sent telegrams of congratulations to the cast after the first night's performance. The reviews in the local newspapers were disappointed with the book, but enthusiastic about the music and songs. </p>

<p>Ida was not yet done with <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. At the time of the North Carolina production, she was reported to be planning a meeting with 20th Century-Fox about a script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. A few months later, when Ida was acting in the film <em>Woman in Hiding</em>, working with director Michael Gordon, this item appeared in papers: "Miss Lupino owns a property she'd like to see staged, and Gordon, a Broadway veteran, is, she sighs, the man to stage it." What else could that be but <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>? Ida clearly did not relinquish her Broadway dreams easily.</p>

<p>The next month, Ida told a North Carolina reporter that she'd like to visit the state in near future to visit friends, including Bill MacIlwinen. "I'm still quite elated over Bill's and my collaboration on the musical comedy, <em>The Apple Tree Farm,</em> which the Carolina Playmakers produced this spring. Maybe we'll do another."</p>

<p>And then <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> really does go dark — eventually falling into that memory black hole.</p>

<p>Morra's article suggests that Ida worked on a screenplay version in the 1950s. By that point, Ida was heavily into film producing, directing, and writing. As her Broadway initiative kept hitting dead ends, it makes sense that she would decide to produce it herself in the medium she was expert at and had some control over. She had so many other projects going, though, that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> does not seem to have gotten much attention at that point, even from her.</p>

<p>As the years passed, Ida Lupino retained the script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> — alone amongst the numerous ones that she had collaborated on through her decades in Hollywood. It was, after all, one her father had given her.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In the classic 1941 film <em>High Sierra</em>, a small dog plays a critical part in the plot. This dog plays a stray named "Pard" that the lead character, a fugitive played by Humphrey Bogart, grows attached to and adopts. In the credits, the dog even gets billing: Pard was played by a dog named Zero.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e948b9c9200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e948b9c9200b img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="High-sierra-1941-humphrey-bogart-and-zero-the-dog-aka-pard" title="High-sierra-1941-humphrey-bogart-and-zero-the-dog-aka-pard" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e948b9c9200b-200wi" /></a>When reading modern articles about <em>High Sierra</em>, it is common to find asides asserting that Zero belonged to Humphrey Bogart in real life. This is certainly plausible, as Bogart and the dog appear to share a deep bond in the film, and there are a number of promotional shots from the movie showing Bogart playing with Zero. </p>

<p>References to Zero being Bogart's dog show up in some books. An example is <em>Crime Wave: The Filmgoer's Guide To the Great Crime Movies</em> (2006), by Howard Hughes: "Bogart's own dog Zero played Pard." Another is <em>The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies</em> (2011), by George Anastasia and Glen Macnow: "Pard is listed in the credits as Zero the Dog and was, in fact, Bogart's pet in real life." This bit of trivia has become so prevalent as to be nearly ubiquitous in mentions of the dog in <em>High Sierra</em> on social media platforms. </p>

<p>Even renowned experts on Hollywood history like TCM's Eddie Muller have promoted this bit of Hollywood trivia. In his outro to <em>High Sierra</em> from a <em>Noir Alley</em> showing in March 2019, Muller states, "The pooch who played Pard was actually Humphrey Bogart's dog, Zero. Just one more example of this film's spot-on casting."</p>

<p>But the reality appears to be different, as I stumbled across recently while reading old newspaper articles about the production of the movie. This Philadelphia Inquirer article from Jan. 31, 1941 provided the first revelation for me that Zero was not, in fact, Humphrey Bogart's dog. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263ec1a5aab200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263ec1a5aab200c img-responsive" alt="HighSierra.ZeroTheDog.PhiladelphiaInquirer.1941Jan31" title="HighSierra.ZeroTheDog.PhiladelphiaInquirer.1941Jan31" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263ec1a5aab200c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a><br />
A shocker for me! Zero belonged to a "talent scout for dogs" named Rennie Renfro. </p>

<p>Other newspaper articles from that year describing the making of the movie discuss Zero, but none that I've found suggest any connection between Bogart and Zero outside of the film production. Plenty, however, mention Renfro's connection to Zero.</p>

<p>A little more research revealed that Renfro was not just any talent scout, but one of the largest suppliers of dog actors for Hollywood at the time, and for years before and after. His most famous dog was Daisy from the long-running Blondie series of films, but he trained and managed dozens more.</p>

<p>The dog Zero had acted in at least two movies prior to <em>High Sierra</em>: Samuel Goldwyn's <em>They Shall Have Music</em> (1939) with famous violinist Jascha Heifetz, and 20th Century-Fox's <em>Daytime Wife</em> (1939) with Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell. Some more research revealed a few films that Zero was in after <em>High Sierra</em>, including MGM's <em>Men of Boys Town</em> (1941) with Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney, and Warner Bros.'s <em>Sergeant York</em> (1941) with Gary Cooper. The last film I have so far found evidence of him in is a poverty row one starring Marjorie Reynolds called <em>Law of the Timber</em> (1941).</p>

<p>While Zero was clearly not Bogart's dog at the time of <em>High Sierra</em>, filmed in the fall of 1940, could Bogart have obtained Zero afterwards?</p>

<p>In fact, there was a story reported in 1941, told second-hand, that Bogart requested to purchase Zero for $600 only to be told by Renfro that the price had increased to $6000. I presume that put an end to Bogart's efforts to obtain Zero. </p>

<p>But of course plenty of this story remains hidden. What became of Zero after 1941? Was Zero in movies in 1942 that I haven't uncovered yet? Did Renfro retire Zero from films after his assistant, Zero's trainer Neil Gazeley, entered the Army in 1941, or for other reasons? If so, could Renfro have sold him to Bogart at that time?</p>

<p>I'm certainly curious of the answers to these, as well as to how and when the urban legend that Zero was Bogart's dog began. If anyone has more info, please let me know!</p>

<p>To close, there is a <em>Life</em> magazine profile of Bogart and his wife Mayo Methot from mid-1944 that contains a posed photo of them with their three dogs. This is three-and-a-half years after the filming of <em>High Sierra</em>. In case it is meaningful, none of the dogs look anything remotely like Zero.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Time for another year-in-review post. It appears my movie watching in 2019 broke the record I had set in 2018. I watched 261 films, 233 of which were new to me. This compares to 2018's number of 226 films total and 202 new to me.</p>

<p>The decadal breakdown of the new-to-me viewings:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1910s: 1</li>
    <li>1920s: 8</li>
    <li>1930s: 88</li>
    <li>1940s: 80</li>
    <li>1950s: 47</li>
    <li>1960s: 6</li>
    <li>1970s: 1</li>
    <li>1980s-present: 2</li>
</ul>

<p>The 1930s still won, but were substantially less dominant than in 2018, with the 1940s and expesially the 1950s making gains relative to last year. </p>

<p>And once again, my rate of watching modern films has fallen to virtually nothing. The only film from the 2010s I watched this past year was a great documentary on the classic Hollywood actress Marsha Hunt: "Marsha Hunt's Sweet Adversity". The only other post-1980 film was the 1994 documentary "George Stevens: D-Day to Berlin". So even when I watch relatively modern movies, they are still about the 1930s-to-1950s.</p>
