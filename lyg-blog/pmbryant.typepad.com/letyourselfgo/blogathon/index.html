At the time the blogathon was announced, I had only seen six of her movies. My favorites were <em>Hangover Square</em> (1945) and <em>Unfaithfully Yours</em> (1948). The others were <em>A Letter to Three Wives</em> (1949), <em>It Happened Tomorrow</em> (1944), <em>Fallen Angel</em> (1945) and <em>The Mark of Zorro</em> (1940).</p>

<p>To expand my knowledge, I  chose to write about a movie I had not seen yet. I initially leaned toward <em>City Without Men</em> (1942). Unfortunately, the copy that I viewed was barely intelligible. So I eagerly switched to <em>Hotel for Women</em> (1939). While that film is also only available in rough copies, the sound quality is good enough to understand the dialogue.  </p>

<p><em>Hotel for Women</em> is the story of a group of young models who reside at a hotel in Manhattan adjacent to Central Park. This was Darnell's very first Hollywood film, yet she has the lead role. She plays a new arrival who quickly becomes a top cigarette ad model, and just as quickly is dropped. Other top roles are played by Ann Sothern as Darnell's mentor, Lynn Bari as Darnell's romantic rival, James Ellison as her status-seeking ex-boyfriend, and John Halliday as a rich womanizer and suitor to Darnell. Elsa Maxwell serves as a one woman Greek chorus and offers this concluding summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Men create the world. Women go around competing in it. All I can say is, it’s a wonder more men aren’t shot!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Monetta becomes Linda</strong></p>

<p>Monetta Darnell was born in Dallas, Texas, on October 16, 1923 to a family of modest means. Her mother had long-held ambitions to be a performer, and she transferred those ambitions to her daughter. Monetta attempted a Hollywood audition in early 1938, and even won a screen test at 20th Century-Fox. But the studio talent scout who had discovered her then told her that she was too young and should return to Dallas. A year later, she tried again. This time she was signed by Fox and moved to Hollywood in early April, 1939. Within a couple weeks, despite her lack of film experience and age of merely 15 years, she was working in the lead role in <em>Hotel for Women</em> under the new name of Linda.</p>

<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c13eb200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c13eb200c img-responsive" alt="Hotel For Women poster" title="Hotel For Women poster" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c13eb200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a><em>Hotel for Women</em> originated several months before Darnell's arrival in Hollywood as a project to exploit the trend of female-dominated shows—a trend accelerated by the success of <em>The Women</em> on Broadway over the previous two years. 20th Century-Fox chief Darryl Zanuck sent screenwriter Kathryn Scola to New York to gain first-hand experience of a "swank hostelry catering exclusively to the ladies," as Louella Parsons put it in a Feb. 2, 1939 column. "Among the guests are highly paid models, career women and others who live by themselves in the big town." </p>

<p>Zanuck signed Elsa Maxwell as a technical advisor in early February, and the film project was officially titled <em>Elsa Maxwell's Hotel for Women</em> to cash in on her notoriety. Maxwell, 56 years old in 1939, was an example of a celebrity who was famous for being famous. Her skill, other than self-promotion, lay at staging notable parties for the rich and famous, including popularizing of party gimmicks such as scavenger hunts. She parlayed this talent into a prominent media career in newspaper and radio. <em>Hotel for Women</em> would be her first foray into feature films. Maxwell not only advised on the film, but contributed to the screenplay and planned to perform a role in the movie. Louella Parsons wrote that Maxwell "will play herself in <em>Hotel for Women</em> and be hostess at an original party such as she herself might give. ... Darryl [Zanuck], who has great appreciation of Miss Maxwell's ability, told me he would give her carte blanche to let the whole world see her idea of the way society entertains."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02eeb200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02eeb200b img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Elsa Maxwell and DarrylZanuck, 1939" title="Elsa Maxwell and DarrylZanuck, 1939" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02eeb200b-300wi" /></a>Fox director Gregory Ratoff was soon assigned to direct the Elsa Maxwell project and Claudette Colbert was mentioned as a likely lead. Louella wrote in February, "The Colbert contract hasn't been signed, but rumor is strong that Claudette will arrange her schedules so she can make the picture." Colbert's possible role was not brought up again. Loretta Young also may have turned down the lead role, according to later reports.</p>

<p>With little success at finding an established star for the lead, Darryl Zanuck set his sights on casting a fresh—and cheaper—face. Wendy Barrie and Nancy Kelly were mentioned at times in February and March. But Zanuck had his eye on young Monetta Darnell as early as March, even though she was not  in Hollywood or even signed by 20th Century-Fox yet.  </p>

<p>Darnell's biographer Ronald Davis wrote that Zanuck "liked her photographs, ran her test footage, and thought she might have enough star quality to play the lead in <em>Hotel for Women</em>. But Darnell had entered a radio contest sponsored by RKO in February, so that studio held an option on her, preventing Fox from signing Darnell. The Fox reps kept quiet and waited for RKO's option to expire in early April. The starting date of <em>Hotel for Women</em> was pushed back from late March to late April.</p>

<p>In the first week of April, Darnell moved to Hollywood and went on salary at Fox at $75 a week. Studio drama coach Florence Enright began coaching her on her walking and confidence. Darnell and her family were cautioned to say little to the press, as Fox was planning a big publicity roll out in the near future--under her new name. Zanuck chose the name Linda because he felt it would "advertise her beauty and suggest a Latin quality that matched her coloring." [Davis]</p>

<p>Two weeks later, announcements hit the trade columns that a "newcomer" was on the rise. Columnist Jimmy Fidler wrote on April 20: "And now a girl named Linda Darnell, entirely innocent of dramatic experience, is to be spotted in the lead of <em>Hotel for Women</em> as a first role. ...  The old-line stars are on the way out; new faces are in demand."</p>

<p>Darnell was 15 years old, but her age was often quoted in the press as 17, or even 19. </p>

<p><strong>Production</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02ef6200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02ef6200b img-responsive" alt="Scene from Hotel for Women with June Gale, Ann Sothern and Linda Darnell" title="Scene from Hotel for Women with June Gale, Ann Sothern and Linda Darnell" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02ef6200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The day after Darnell's announcement, and just a few days before filming was to begin, Fox announced a more established actress for another of the lead roles in <em>Hotel for Women</em>. Louella Parsons' April 21 column included a subhead, "Ann Sothern Gets Lead in Hotel for Women". This is Ann Sothern in the brief period after which her breakout film of <em>Maisie</em> had been filmed, but before it had been released to far greater than expected success. Sothern had been playing substantial roles in Hollywood films for six years and was coming off a career revival after her supporting role in the previous years' <em>Trade Winds</em>. Parsons wrote that "Darryl Zanuck has made [Sothern] the femme lead, which I consider smart casting, for Ann is a capable trouper and always gives a good account of herself." </p>

<p>The Fox studio publicity people attempted to play up a rivalry between the MGM current production that was adapting the stage play <em>The Women</em> and Fox's <em>Hotel for Women</em>. A couple days after Sothern was announced for the cast, Parsons wrote that director Gregory Ratoff had told her: "This is Ratoff's answer to <em>The Women</em>. You, my dear, will have a bathtub scene that will make the play look like a bird bath." Later, a columnist quoted Elsa Maxwell as saying to Norma Shearer, star of MGM's film, "'My dear,' hissed Elsa Maxwell, 'I understand <em>The Women</em> will be released as a trailer for <em>Hotel for Women</em>.'"</p>

<p>Other publicity during production mostly centered around Elsa Maxwell's adjustment to being in front of the cameras, and director Ratoff's exuberance and broken English. An example item from Erskine Johnson: "When Elsa Maxwell pronounced Syracuse as 'Sarahcuse' for a scene in <em>Hotel for Women</em>, Director Gregory Ratoff stopped the camera and said: 'You are working with me only one week and already you can't speak Ainglish.'"</p>

<p>Later publicity claimed: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A momentary setback for Elsa was when she found that she had to stage 
  a cocktail party for the picture. This was contrary to her principles 
  as she has never given one in her life and considers them a commonplace 
  form of entertainment. "Cocktail parties," said Elsa, "are given for people 
  you do not care to invite to lunch or dinner." 
  She solved the problem by staging a lavish party that outdid all other cocktail parties, 
  and then wrote into the script her dialogue which kids this whole institution. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c1441200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c1441200c img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Linda Darnell and Elsa Maxwell walk side by side in promotional still for Hotel for Women, 1939" title="Linda Darnell and Elsa Maxwell walk side by side in promotional still for Hotel for Women, 1939" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c1441200c-300wi" /></a>In late May, as filming neared completion, director Ratoff said of Darnell, "Linda is going to be a star overnight in her first picture." The studio was also looking for Elsa Maxwell's next vehicle. Sheilah Graham wrote that "After her current <em>Hotel for Women</em>, the roly-poly party giver gets a role in 'Public Debutante Number One'. Surely they don't mean Elsa?"</p>

<p>Filming wrapped in early June, and Ratoff was immediately sent to work for David O. Selznick on <em>Intermezzo</em>, starring Leslie Howard and Ingrid Bergman, in her first Hollywood film. </p>

<p>As 20th Century-Fox planned a release of <em>Hotel for Women</em> for late summer, they also gave Linda Darnell her next assignment—in a supporting role in the big budget John Ford western <em>Drums Along the Mohawk</em>, starring Claudette Colbert and Henry Fonda, which was going to Utah for extensive location shooting starting July 1.</p>

<p><em>Hotel for Women</em> was first shown to the public at a preview in Los Angles on July 27. Los Angeles Times columnist Edwin Schallert wrote that it was a "very efficiently made contrivance featuring young feminine players especially and giving a play to romance," with a tired plot line in the final act. He calls Darnell, "Miss Barnell" twice and describes her performance as "pleasing, though as yet perhaps somewhat undefined as a screen personality." He also wrote, "Ann Sothern is very good in her semi-stellar part," and "Miss Maxwell is no Marie Dressler. That might as well be settled now. She is good because she is natural in the few scenes allotted to her, but the role she plays is pretty incidental."</p>

<p>The reviewer for the Hollywood Citizen-News described the film as "unmitigatedly tedious, vacuous and old-fashioned, ... the doings of the Elsa Maxwell smart set, as chronicled on screen, were almost as boring as the doings of the Elsa Maxwell smart set in real life. ... Linda Darnell is still mainly decorative, but she has a fresh and vivid physical appeal and won considerable favor with last night's preview goers. She ought to be in pictures. ... Miss Sothern, like the cavalry, comes on screen now and again to rescue the picture, but eventually gives it back to the Indians."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c144b200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c144b200c img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Linda Darnell and James Ellison is studio portrait for Hotel for Women, 1939" title="Linda Darnell and James Ellison is studio portrait for Hotel for Women, 1939" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c144b200c-300wi" /></a>The most influential Hollywood columnists mostly praised Linda Darnell. Louella Parsons did so repeatedly over the next few days, getting more emphatic each day.  July 30: "She is really a promising newcomer." July 31: "Producers yell 'wolf' so often about their discoveries that it's nothing short of a nine days' wonder when a girl like Linda Darnell really lives up to advance adjectives." Aug 1: "If a star can be born over-night, that's what happened to Linda Darnell after the preview of <em>Hotel for Women</em>." Mark Hellinger wrote on Aug. 3: "The Darnell lassie needs a bit of polish, but she's definitely on her way. Watch her go." Hedda Hopper wrote the same day about Darnell: "There's a real bet if I ever saw one."</p>

<p>The favorable reaction to Darnell after the preview appears to have served like a bat signal to Darryl Zanuck, who shifted Darnell into immediate star-building mode. He pulled her out of <em>Drums Along the Mohawk</em>—scrapping all her scenes already filmed in Utah, and recasting other scenes with Dorris Bowden—because he did not want Darnell to follow up her initial success in a secondary role. She was  also nixed as the leading lady opposite the studio's top male star Tyrone Power in <em>Johnny Apollo</em>. Briefly, she was announced for the lead in the upcoming 'Public Deb No. 1' before Zanuck finally settled on costarring her with Power in <em>Day-Time Wife</em>, which would begin shooting in September. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, <em>Hotel for Women</em> had begun its gradual rollout across the country, opening in some mid-size cities in early August, and more throughout the month until its scheduled openings in Los Angeles on Aug. 23 and New York City on the 25th. Darnell was sent to her hometown of Dallas for the opening of <em>Hotel for Women</em> there on Aug. 17, which became a major local event, with 2500 people greeting her arrival at the train station and another large crowd gathered outside the theater where she gave a short speech before the screening: "Words fail me when I try to express my appreciation for the marvelous reception given me by the people of Dallas. Everything was perfect and my only regret was that I can't stay longer." (Davis)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c14ca200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c14ca200c img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Linda Darnell studio portrait, 1939" title="Linda Darnell studio portrait, 1939" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c14ca200c-300wi" /></a>A week later, <em>Hotel for Women</em> hit New York City, where the reception was less than glowing. Kate Cameron wrote in the New York Daily News: "Darryl Zanuck might better have remained silent about Linda Darnell, his latest candidate for stardom, until he had been able to offer her a vehicle geared to take her to the heights of cinema fame. <em>Hotel for Women</em>, which opened at the Roxy Theatre yesterday, is made of brittle, unsubstantial material that is far more apt to throw the pretty tyro for a loss than to carry her safely to the high spot where 20th Century-Fox exploiters believe she belongs. Linda is a beauty with a sweet, fresh look that is enormously appealing. But the part she plays gives her little, if any, opportunity to show that she can act." Frank Nugent wrote in the New York Times: "Beyond this nothing really need be said about the picture except that it introduces a newcomer, one Linda Darnell, who is as pretty as a model should be and probably will not be challenging Miss Bette Davis's academy title for quite a few years." </p>

<p>Much of what few positive notices the movie received continued to go to Ann Sothern—who, since filming of <em>Hotel for Women</em> concluded, had hit it big as the title character in MGM's sleeper hit, <em>Maisie</em>. Cameron of the Daily News claimed that Sothern was the "one really bright spot of the film," while Nugent of the Times added, "Ann Sothern... handles her too-few comedy lines with an ease that demonstrates again that she is Hollywood's best least-recognized comedienne. Some day a script, a director and Miss Sothern are going to meet and bring the house down. <em>Hotel for Women</em> is, naturally, not the place for such a rendezvous." </p>

<p>Elsa Maxwell's feature film career did not last much longer, dying after another role as herself in 20th Century-Fox's <em>Elsa Maxwell's Public Deb No. 1</em> (1940). She continued her celebrity status in newspapers, magazines and radio as "America's foremost authority on how to be popular and how to have fun in life".</p>

<p>Zanuck's Linda Darnell publicity train had such momentum that the tepid reaction that her debut picture received from the New York critics could do little to derail it. Darnell would go on to near equal, above-the-title, billing with Tyrone Power in her second film, <em>Day-Time Wife</em> (1939), and then star in a role very similar to herself in a pseudo-autobiographical film, depicting some of the events of her rise to Hollywood: <em>Star Dust</em> (1940). Less than a year after her arrival in Hollywood, 16 years old, Linda Darnell placed her hand and footprints in cement at Grauman's Chinese Theater alongside long time Hollywood legends.</p>

To celebrate the memory of dear departed classic film champion and <a href="https://www.caftanwoman.com/">blogger</a> Patricia Nolan-Hall, for <a href="https://www.ladyevesreellife.com/2022/05/the-caftan-woman-blogathon.html">"The Caftan Woman Blogathon"</a>, I am covering a time in the life and career of Ida Lupino that Paddy had touched upon in her writing a few years ago. </p>

<p>Paddy contributed an article to the collection of essays <a href="https://medium.com/cinesuffragette/the-ida-lupino-files-76530b1d243c"><em>The Ida Lupino Files</em></a> entitled <em>Ida Lupino Directs The Fugitive And Creates Classic Television</em>. Lupino directed three episodes of that television show, all in its first season—1963-'64. In her essay, Paddy summarizes these episodes for those of us not familiar with them. My essay will cover events in Lupino's life in the months prior to and after working on <em>The Fugitive</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>At the time Lupino directed <em>The Fugitive</em>, she was in her mid-40s and at the height of the television-directing episode of her career.  Television director was one of several incarnations Lupino went through during her nearly five decade in show business, including roles as actress, composer, writer, producer, and motion picture director. Over three decades earlier, Lupino had begun her film career in her native England at the age of fourteen, with lead roles in six films. Within a year, she was discovered by Hollywood, signed to a multi-year contract and moved across the Atlantic. Her acting career had ups and downs in the 1930s, but by the early 1940s she had become a big name thanks to her roles in films like <em>The Light That Failed</em>, <em>They Drive By Night</em>, and <em>High Sierra</em>. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://www.ladyevesreellife.com/2022/05/the-caftan-woman-blogathon.html"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e154187f200b img-responsive" alt="Caftan Woman Blogathon 2022" title="Caftan Woman Blogathon 2022" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e154187f200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>For the next decade, she was a full-fledged movie star. Yet, as reporter Peter Bart described her later, she "was a movie star who hated stardom, a glamour queen who loathed glamour". Near the end of the 1940s, Lupino decided to shift away from acting towards the work she found more interesting. She started her own production company in partnership with then-husband Collier Young. She co-wrote and co-produced several successful low-budget pictures—and became the only woman director in Hollywood at the time.</p>

<p>By 1954, the popularity of television was revolutionizing the film industry. Lupino's company, <em>The Filmakers</em>, was a victim of the changing times. She then moved into television acting and writing, with occasional film roles added in. By the late 1950s, she and new husband Howard Duff had created a sitcom that they starred in, <em>Mr. Adams and Eve</em>, which had a brief run of popularity. The show was cancelled in 1958 after two seasons, and Lupino, now 40, decided again to move behind the scenes. She started directing television shows in late 1958 with <em>Have Gun, Will Travel</em> and soon became in-demand. She virtually gave up acting—aside from infrequent guest appearances on television.</p>

<p><strong>1963-1964</strong></p>

<p>This brings us to the year when Lupino became involved with <em>The Fugitive</em>, nearly five years into her television directing career.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1541943200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1541943200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino with Gary Clarke on The Virginian episode 'A Distant Fury', 1963" title="Ida Lupino with Gary Clarke on The Virginian episode 'A Distant Fury', 1963" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1541943200b-250wi" /></a>Lupino began 1963 with work as both actor and director on <em>Sam Benedict</em>, a detective show starring Edmond O'Brien. O'Brien had worked with Lupino in her days as a movie producer-director, starring in two of her films a decade earlier—<em>The Hitch-Hiker</em> and <em>The Bigamist</em>. Now, Lupino acted with him on his television show as a guest star, and directed two other episodes. Also in the early months of 1963, Lupino directed two episodes of <em>The Untouchables</em>, plus appeared as a guest star on an episode of <em>The Virginian</em>. </p>

<p>Both of Lupino's guest acting appearances in early 1963 were alongside her husband, Howard Duff, who she frequently tried to work with. She and Duff had been married in late 1951 immediately after Lupino had obtained a divorce from Collier Young. Lupino gave birth to their daughter in the spring of 1952. By the next year, the Lupino-Duff marriage was in trouble—very public trouble. They had several prolonged separations that were much discussed in the press. With each one, divorce seemed more likely. Yet each time they reconciled—to the amazement of their friends.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278807b8705200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20278807b8705200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino with daughter Bridget and husband Howard Duff in 1955, during filming of the film 'While the City Sleeps'" title="Ida Lupino with daughter Bridget and husband Howard Duff in 1955, during filming of the film 'While the City Sleeps'" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278807b8705200d-250wi" /></a>By 1955, with their tempestuous relationship inspiring the theme of the sitcom they were then developing, the Lupino-Duff marriage appears to have stabilized. But once <em>Mr. Adams and Eve</em> was in the past, their troubles occasionally returned. The 1963-'64 period appears to have been relatively calm, as there were no indications in the press of any personal troubles between them, and the two appeared together on television frequently. For instance, aside from their acting appearances mentioned above, they were both guests of new host Johnny Carson on the <em>Tonight Show</em> in May, 1963.  </p>

<p>Lupino and Duff also were business partners, with Lupino trying to replicate the success she had had as an independent producer with Collier Young and <em>The Filmakers</em> from 1949 to 1954. In late 1961, she and Duff formed Stanley Productions—named after her late father—to produce a thriller they had purchased entitled <em>The Plotters</em>. By May, 1963, this project was still in development, but clearly Lupino was pushing hard. An article in the Philadelphia Daily News quotes her:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My husband and I are now planning to make some films in the next couple of years. 
  We are highly encouraged by the fact that the money men and producers seem to want to keep production here in the United States and are willing to put up money for low-budget pictures.</p>
  
  <p>The story is the thing.
  About a year ago we bought a couple of books, including one called "The Plotters", which we hope to get into production next month. </p>
  
  <p>Our company is a combination of a friend of ours named Fred Hamilton, who used to be a production executive at NBC, my husband, and me. 
  They are the president and vice-president, in reverse order, and I’m treasurer.
  We call the company Stanley Productions, after my father. 
  I’ll direct some of these pictures... but I’ll keep a hand in all the rest of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The setup that Lupino sketches here sounds virtually identical to that for <em>The Filmakers</em> from a decade prior. With her earlier company, Lupino similarly had two business partners—with one her husband—plus she directed some films and kept a hand in "all the rest".</p>

<p>At this same time, Louella Parsons wrote that Lupino and Duff aimed to launch a "full-scale production program of two movie scripts and three TV pilots", while simultaneously writing a children's book.</p>

<p>Alas, while Lupino discussed Stanley Productions into at least 1966 and pursued similar projects well into the 1970s, no new productions by Lupino ever materialized. It's not clear from the public record why her aim to again independently produce and direct films was stymied. Perhaps a hint is that, a few years later, Lupino wrote an essay (<em>Me, Mother Directress</em>) where she mentioned having turned down good opportunities to direct films because they would have to be produced overseas and she did not want to spend months away from her husband and daughter.</p>

<p>So with Stanley Productions unable to move forward, Lupino maintained her directing career with work in television. In late April, 1963, shortly before her <em>Tonight Show</em> appearance, Lupino signed to direct several episodes of the new series <em>The Fugitive</em> that would air on ABC-TV in the fall. Also for the 1963-'64 season, she signed to direct episodes of <em>Mr. Novak</em>, <em>The Breaking Point</em>, <em>Dr. Kildare</em>, <em>Kraft Suspense Theater</em>, and <em>The Twilight Zone</em>. This last one, where she directed the episode titled <em>The Masks</em>, is one of her most often cited and most well-regarded directorial efforts today. She also continued her writing, and, in collaboration with her younger cousin, Richard Lupino, sold a script to Alfred Hitchcock for his television show.</p>

<p>In addition to her busy directorial schedule and behind-the-scenes efforts on Stanley Productions, Lupino continued to dabble in acting, despite some possible insecurities about aging. Columnist Sidney Skolsky quoted her in August: "I’ve never gone through that frightening period of having been a glamor girl. To be a glamor girl and then lose your looks must mean a painful emotional transition."</p>

<p>Lupino was one of several celebrity guest stars, including husband Duff, who had small roles in an episode of <em>Burke's Law</em> aired on November 8, 1963. And she had a co-starring role in an episode of Kraft Suspense Theater, <em>One Step Down</em>, with Gena Rowlands and Leslie Nielsen, that aired the next week. </p>

A few days after that, November 19, the first of the episodes she directed for <em>The Fugitive</em> aired—<em>Fatso</em>. Two weeks later, with President Kennedy's assassination happening in the interim, her second directed episode of <em>The Fugitive</em> was shown—<em>Glass Tightrope</em>. Six weeks after that, her third and final one, <em>The Garden House</em>, aired on January 14, 1964.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202942fa94124200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202942fa94124200c img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="The Twilight Zone, The Masks, 1964" title="The Twilight Zone, The Masks, 1964" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202942fa94124200c-250wi" /></a>Lupino's now most famous television directing effort—<em>The Masks</em> for <em>The Twilight Zone</em>—aired on March 30 to virtually no press notice. While that episode receives a lot of attention today, Lupino herself appears to have thought her work that season on <em>The Fugitive</em> and <em>Mr. Novak</em> was most worthy of recognition. The New York Daily News reported in September, 1963 that her ambition was to win an Emmy award for either of those shows.  Furthermore, in an interview a decade later (published in <em>People Will Talk</em> by John Kobal), Lupino mentioned her work on <em>The Fugitive</em>, <em>Mr. Novak</em> and <em>The Untouchables</em> as work she especially enjoyed. </p>

<p>An anecdote published in July 1964, said that Lupino "will go to any lengths to get the effect she wants. She was directing a show that called for a breath-taking drive down a steep mountain road. With a stuntman doing the driving, Ida climbed into the back seat with a cameraman and gave running directions to both men during the hazardous drive. The brass at the studio, which objected strenuously to Ida's taking such an active part, breathed a sigh of relief when everyone came out unscathed."</p>

<p>After November, 1963, Lupino had no further acting appearance on television that season. But she did appear with her husband on the evening premiere of the game show <em>You Don't Say</em> on Jan. 7, 1964. She and Duff also appeared on another game show the next July called <em>The Celebrity Game</em>.</p>

<p>As the 1964-'65 television season opened, Lupino's work on <em>The Fugitive</em> was in the past—but new projects beckoned. She acted and directed on <em>The Rogues</em>, a well-received comedy caper show starring Lupino's old acting colleagues David Niven, Charles Boyer and Gig Young and produced by her ex-husband Collier Young. She directed some comedy shows with <em>Gilligan's Island</em> and <em>Bewitched</em>—and more.</p>

<p>But the biggest project, finally getting underway early in 1965, was to become the first feature film she had directed in over a decade, plus her first and only feature film that she directed for a major studio—the movie initially known as <em>Mother Superior</em> and later released as <em>The Trouble With Angels</em>, starring Rosalind Russell and Haley Mills. That, of course, marked the beginning of yet another episode in Ida Lupino's storied career and is a tale for another day.</p>
