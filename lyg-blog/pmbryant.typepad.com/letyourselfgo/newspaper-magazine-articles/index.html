This article purportedly contains the words of her mother, Connie Lupino, filtered through a writer for the film magazine, <em>Hollywood</em>. </p>

<p>It was published in the February 1936 issue, and likely written around December 1935, a couple months before Ida's eighteenth birthday. At this point, Ida had already been in Hollywood for over two years, and had been a film star for over three, including a year in her native England.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>My Daughter Ida</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>By <em>Mrs. Lupino</em></strong></p>
  
  <p>Yowsah, Ida's sweet as apple cider—And her mother's right beside her!</p>
  
  <p>(As told to HARMONY HAYNES)</p>
  
  <p><em>Hollywood</em>, Feb. 1936</p>
  
  <p>This has been such a happy, carefree year that at times it is a bit difficult for me to realize that this lovely young lady with whom I play is really my own little daughter grown up.</p>
  
  <p>And how does Ida feel about me? I've never asked her but I would say that she gives me a very daughterly love and affection—but when it comes to respect? Then I'm afraid I'm just the girl friend.</p>
  
  <p>I don't mean by that remark that Ida is disrespectful for she is never that—to anyone, but instead of bowing dutifully when I speak and saying, "Yes, Mother," she'll screw up her face and say, "Well, now I thought—". And I'm always glad to hear what she thinks on any question. I never wanted my children to bow to my decisions just because I happened to be their mother.</p>
  
  <p>Ida's father, Stanley Lupino, and I were mere kids when we married. He was rapidly becoming a great favorite as a dancer and comedian on the English stage and I played as his soubrette. We had been married two and one-half years and come from the provinces to London, when Ida was born.</p>
  
  <p>We felt that his future on the London stage was secure enough so that we could safely take a house and I could devote my time to mother him and the baby. However, I returned to the stage many times at the request of producers, but managed to be at home enough to superintend the rearing of Ida and Rita, who was three years younger.</p>
  
  <p>• We had no careers mapped out for our children but felt that they would just naturally turn to the stage the minute they were old enough to talk and walk.</p>
  
  <p>However, Ida disappointed us. She didn't seem to care much about the profession nor show any marked talent for it. At school she was a very apt pupil, never satisfied with anything but the highest marks. She was very good at painting and sketching and couldn't get enough of it. She studied everything she could about acting and about the theatre in general, reading plays, reading histories of the stage, biographies of players. With equal enthusiasm she studied music and dancing.</p>
  
  <p>• She felt that the motion picture was fast robbing the stage of its time-honored place and through her cousin, Lupino Lane, obtained extra work at the British International Studios. Not long after that, she discovered that Allan Dwan, an American director, was testing girls for a small part in a picture he was to direct, called <em>Her First Affair</em>. </p>
  
  <p>Ida was very anxious to work in the picture, to be on the set and to learn all she could from this American man. She applied for a test and met Mr. Dwan. He passed her up for the part she applied for and gave her the lead—a grown-up lead and she was but thirteen-and-a-half!</p>
  
  <p>Perhaps because her father had never permitted her to play child parts, perhaps because she had always associated with grown-ups, or perhaps because Mr. Dwan was a very splendid director, she made good in that first picture and from then on played leads. </p>
  
  <p>• Once, it seemed that her career must be halted—forever. Ida was run over by an automobile. She was hurled high into the air and crashed down upon a gravel walk. Her sweet little face was literally torn to shreds. Those were pitifully anxious months waiting for the bandages to be removed—and when they were removed—scars—horrid scars! However, the doctor told us that in time they would diminish. They have—you can scarcely see them now, but at the time it was hard for us to believe. </p>
  
  <p>Ida, however, did not share our pessimism. She had read of a like accident befalling Carole Lombard. She had seen Carole on the screen and thought her the most beautiful woman in the world. If she could suffer such injury and still be so perfect to the camera eye, Ida felt she had nothing to worry about.</p>
  
  <p>She was right—and to this day, Ida almost worships the beauty of Carole Lombard. There are certain angles in pictures, where Ida resembles Carole, and I notice that those are always the pictures she drags out to show people. If anyone notices the resemblance, Ida is happy for days, feeling that they are "sisters under the scars".</p>
  
  <p>• There was much excitement at our house when Ida was invited to come to America to make a test for <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. We understood it was to be a great picture and that the girl fortunate enough to play in it would be, as the Americans say, <em>set for life</em>.</p>
  
  <p>It was Ida's big chance, we were all agreed on that, but wasn't she too young to go to a strange country all alone? I had been to America, I knew the ropes, so to speak, but if I went with her, my husband and I would be separated for the first time in our married lives. Then there was Rita who certainly was at the age when she most needed her mother. Ida would have to go alone.</p>
  
  <p>"All right," Ida said, "I don't know a thing about the country, nor the people, nor the money, and I've heard Hollywood is a dangerous place, but I'll go alone. It'll be better than breaking up the family."</p>
  
  <p>She said it as bravely as a sixteen-year-old could say anything, but we couldn't help but feel the trembling in her heart. Our decision was reached, I was to accompany her and Rita was to stay with her father.</p>
  
  <p>I didn't know just how long I would be gone but I determined that for Ida's sake, I would make it a lovely holiday. Ida, of course, would have to work hard, but she must have a good time, too, so that if nothing came of the venture, we could go home with happy memories. </p>
  
  <p>• When Ida was tested for the role of <em>Alice</em>, it was found that she didn't photograph childish enough. However, she was placed under a long-term contract and so began her American career.</p>
  
  <p>She is very nervous and easily discouraged when she is starting a picture, but once the picture is under way she is sure of herself and everything goes along smoothly.</p>
  
  <p>She liked Hollywood and its people—she became a little "Yankee" overnight, bringing home to me bits of American slang and American phrases. Americans like her, too, and took her up professionally as well as socially. They were equally as kind to me—scarcely an invitation comes to Ida that does not include me, and usually, I accept, because this is my holiday.</p>
  
  <p>• When Ida is on a picture, we lead very quiet lives, reading, writing letters, listening to the radio—anything and everything but knit and we've threatened to take that up soon. Ida studies a great deal—it is her ambition to be a very well informed person. No matter what subject comes up during the day, if it is foreign to Ida, you may be sure she'll be surrounded with a flock of books that evening doing research work.</p>
  
  <p>She always says, "I never want to have to sit in a corner and keep quiet just because I don't know what people are talking about." It has always been her theory, and I think a good one, that anything she takes the trouble to look up will remain a permanent part of her education.</p>
  
  <p>Since I came to America solely in the interests of Ida's career, she insisted that she take care of all financial obligations. She has done so in a manner that makes me very proud of her.</p>
  
  <p>We have always had a home, so she wanted one in Hollywood. It was not sensible to buy a home at first so we rented a furnished house. Ida was not pleased with the way it was furnished but rather than put a lot of money into furniture, she merely had the old upholstered pieces covered with brightly colored glazed chints.</p>
  
  <p>She employs a cook, a driver and a maid. She thought at first that she could do without the driver but driving makes her very nervous.</p>
  
  <p>At times when I think she is being a bit extravagant, I quietly talk things over with her, and we cut down on bills. Outside of spending money on others, Ida is not extravagant. She has quite simple tastes. She doesn't care for clothes, especially fluffy, girlish things. Her street clothes and party clothes are always neat and conservative. Her home clothes consist of pajamas or slacks. She does like shoes and can never seem to buy enough of these lovely American styles. </p>
  
  <p>She doesn't like beauty parlors—they make her very nervous. On the set her maid does her hair and at home, she likes to do it herself. It really takes very little "doing" since she never looks sweeter than when it is combed back of her ears and a little ribbon tied on the top of her head. </p>
  
  <p>A few months ago, we went to London for a visit. Our first trip home after coming to American in 1933. Rita was just beginning to grow into a tall shy girl. Ida felt that Rita was developing an inferiority complex from having a father busy on the stage and in pictures and from having a mother and sister in Hollywood. She insisted on bringing Rita to Hollywood with her and ridding her of her self-consciousness.</p>
  
  <p>Rita has had the time of her young life permitting Ida to play guardian. Rita has dancing lessons, tennis lessons, riding lessons and skating lessons. Since Ida wanted the responsibility, I do not interfere with the "lessons".</p>
  
  <p>• When it comes to love affairs, Ida is a lover of love. She comes by it naturally. Stanley was the one love of my life and I have never gotten beyond the lover stage. The nearest to a cross word Stanley has ever spoken to me is to boyishly say, "Three women in the house and I'm out of shaving cream!"</p>
  
  <p>So when Ida fancies herself in love, which she does quite often, she takes it seriously for a while. Then it doesn't go as smoothly as she feels that it should, and she comes to me heart-broken. I let her wait about it for a while because I know that young girls must enjoy their "heartache" a little bit. If she doesn't snap out of it then, all I have to do is to accuse her of being dramatic. Then the funny side of it appeals to her sense of humor and she is able to laugh at herself. And I know that when the right man comes along, it will be all laughter—no tears.</p>
  
  <p>Stanley has just arrived in Hollywood for a visit. When he must return to England, I am going with him and taking Rita. I shall be very happy to be home once more but it will be a long, long time before I forget my wonderful Hollywood holiday with my <em>daughter-friend</em>, Ida Lupino.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Post-script: Connie Lupino did not, in fact, return to England with Stanley in early 1936. She stayed in Hollywood with her daughters.</p>

  <p><strong>Your Soldier and Mine...</strong></p>
  
  <p><em>by Ida Lupino</em></p>
  
  <p>(In <em>Screen Stars, June 1944</em>)</p>
  
  <p><em>It is our proud privilege to present Ida Lupino's own story, written especially for you. This fine actress dwells on a subject closest to her heart -- and yours -- our soldiers. It will awaken you anew to the debt and deep gratitude we owe these wonderful boys.</em></p>
  
  <p>OUR returning men will require an even greater courage to face the problems of eventual peace than the blind disregard of physical danger demanded of them to face the enemy.</p>
  
  <p>Even as we have depended on them, now they must depend on us as civilian individuals to make "home" a decent place to come back to. We civilians have only begun our war. A war to do our share in evening the score for our men when they return as veterans to look for jobs—to resume their part in civilian life.</p>
  
  <p>Our men must never feel that they are neglected outsiders. They must never wonder why, and for what reason, they are carrying an empty sleeve, crutches, or a cane.</p>

  <p>Every citizen should pledge him or herself to find one job for one ex-serviceman. Suppose there are no jobs—<em>then we must make them</em>. If there are four passengers to be crowded into the back seat of a car which would normally accommodate three—you crowd over—double up. That's the way it must be with jobs.</p>
  
  <p>There must be no "sorry, come back another day." No weeks of trudging the streets, trying to find some way to re-enter civilian life!</p>
  
  <p>Just visit the hospitals! Talk to our men returning from action overseas. Count the cost for them!</p>
  
  <p>There's a kid whose whole life centered on his ability to lift high tension wires. He took considerable pride in this feat. A neck nerve was severed in battle at Attu. He can't lift with either left or right arm. But he has been re-established in the American way of life. Warner Brothers gave him a job in the mailing department. He is no longer conscious of his disabilities as a permanent insurmountable handicap!</p>
  
  <p>There's the great ace pilot who today wears steel plates in his head from World War I. He has trained hundreds of men for the R.A.F. and also ferried planes until his health cracked. True, he could no longer fly, but he said, "I can do so many other things. I', only 40. I can fit in somewhere. I can do something, if I can get a job."</p>

  <p>For four weeks, he tried unsuccessfully. Some of us took it upon ourselves to see that he found one. We went scouting around and now he's handling actors. He is again in the active scheme of useful civilian life. And he's happy.</p>
  
  <p>Craig Reynolds returned from Guadalcanal wearing a brace from his knee to his foot. Immediately he was given a job by RKO and a good contract. That is the way it should be. Immediate jobs for every veteran.</p>
  
  <p>Each civilian must say, "I personally will see that the guy who needs a job—gets work." So you go to town and you start contacting people. Come hell or high water you take the individual responsibility. You fight this battle—as only a civilian can.</p>
  
  <p>I may be pretty rabid on this subject, but I have 10,000,000 men who will back me up—and tens of thousands of civilians, too. So it's going to be a little tough to do a job for every soldier. Okay, the war is tough. And battle is tough. And we civilians have been affected the least. Our personal war is this responsibility now—planning a sound post-war world for our boys. </p>
  
  <p>In the meantime, I wonder if civilians understand that they don't have to belong to organizations, nor wait to be asked by special committees to make good-cheer visits to our wounded who have already returned. No one can realize how much it means until they have talked to these boys. Just a smile, an exchange of words—a short chat is
  enough to brighten their day.</p>
  
  <p>I visit the Norco Naval Hospital at Corona, California, regularly. It is here that you find the real casualties from overseas, It would take three months to go through the tremendous hospital at Norco and give individual attention to each patient, but since I have been free from studio work in the past few months I have visited there weekly—and eventually I hope to be able to say I have met and talked with every man in that hospital.</p>
  
  <p>The great courage and philosophy and sense of humor of these kids—for so many are just kids—is inspirational. I have been privileged to meet some of them on a common ground—through kinship with my own experiences. In the skin grafting wards, for instance, the most amazing miracles of medical science and skill are being effected. There was the boy whose plane crashed. A flaming torch, he managed to drag two of his buddies from the burning wreckage. In a few months, he will leave that hospital with a complete new face. There will never be any surface evidence of the untold horror and suffering he has experienced. </p>
  
  <p>It is fascinating to mark the progress of new noses, new chins, new hands and fingers. These boys and I, as I said, have something in common. When I was thirteen I was run over by a speeding automobile. My face was terribly lacerated. My thumb and knee cap we're practically torn off. I couldn't tell you how many times I've told my story to the kids at the hospital. To help encourage them—to point out how, even in the infancy of plastic surgery, my finger and knee cap mended. I still have the slight scars to prove my story—and the boys who are awaiting their skin grafts and plastic work seem to worry just a little less after we finish talking. Quite justifiably they have the greatest confidence in these surgeons whose results beggar description. They are accomplishing miracles. One has to <em>see</em> them, to believe.</p>
  
  <p>Having fully recovered from an attack of infantile paralysis, I can talk about that, too, with the boys in these wards. We chin by the hour on our "case histories."</p>
  
  <p>I had been visiting at the hospital one day when the C.O. asked me if I'd mind staying to meet some of the new boys. I saw them that night—the kids coming in direct from the South Pacific—hundreds of them. Those that could walk came in with their duffle bags slung cockily over their shoulders. They walked down the corridor of the hospital—and past me.</p>
  
  <p>"Holy Smoke—what a paradise!" they ejaculated. Suddenly, someone recognized me. "Gad awmighty, if it isn't Ida Lupino!"</p>
  
  <p>"Say," somebody else sighed, "I think we're going to <em>love</em> this place. It looks like a regular class hotel and here's an actress from Hollywood to greet us." I wouldn't take anything for the privilege of meeting those kids as they came in that night. I don't care how corny I may sound—it hit me, down deep inside.</p>
  
  <p>Since I am a Marine's wife, I think I am entitled to say just a word or two about my own husband, Captain Louis Hayward, even though he is "set" against any kind of publicity for himself. When he came home from the battle of Tarawa, he was scared stiff by the deluge of requests for photographs and interviews.</p>
  
  <p>"I'm through being an actor," he said sincerely, "for the duration. Why should I pose for pictures? Who am I to spout off about my part at Tarawa? I fought beside heroes—and I saw them die. And you can't talk about that." And he didn't.</p>
  
  <p>It was with Louis that I first visited the Tarawa casualties at Norco. I was little Miss Nobody that day. A moving picture actress didn't mean a thing. The boys were polite, but it was "the Captain we want to see. Where is he?"</p>
  
  <p>There was a bad shrapnel case. "Why Cap," the lad grinned through me at Louis, "why not move in? You don"t look so hot?"</p>
  
  <p>Louis smiled back, "Well maybe I will."</p>
  
  <p>I'm glad I was with him that day. It was inexplicable—the exchange of looks between the Captain and these kids. They'd been through it together, and no one except one who had, could crash the understanding they shared.</p>
  
  <p>To get back to the important business of our Civilian War Front. No one can underestimate the responsibility every individual should assume, in doing their part for the boys who have returned. The honorably discharged... the wounded... require everyone's help in erasing the scars of battle—in helping to restore them to a normal life again—to a feeling of security in the freedom of a land that is theirs, and all of ours. When one gets an opportunity to talk to these boys, they tell you enthusiastically about some of Hollywood's own, to whom they are grateful.</p>
  
  <p>Kay Francis is one of the great unsung heroines of this war. Quietly, without fanfare, she spends every other day of her life visiting the hospitals. And the men virtually worship her.</p>
  
  <p>Humphrey Bogart is the tops of all time. He's so tough, and real, and down-to-earth. Louis told me that the men would wait hours in the rain in the South Pacific, to catch even one sequence of a Bogart picture.</p>
  
  <p>And Joe E. Brown—they can't rave enough about him. No island has been too obscure for him to visit. He is likely to turn up anywhere—unheralded. He just arrives with, "well, here I am, boys"—and the show is on.</p>
  
  <p>Bob Hope, of course, is tireless—one of the great civilian heroes of this, or any war. To say the boys worship him would be understating it.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, few of us can even attempt to compete with his socko entertainment for the men. Since this is a fact, most of us have discovered we do better on a program designed so the boys can join in the fun.</p>
  
  <p>Irene Dunne arrived at a camp to sing a few songs and found there was no accompaniest. Thousands of soldiers sat there quietly, waiting to see what she was going to do. </p>
  
  <p>Irene broke down, and broke them down, with the blunt admission, "Hey, fellas, this is new to me. My accompaniest isn't here—but I can sing a couple of songs if you'll help me out!" A barrage of applause gave their approval. And without accompaniment, Irene started to sing—familiar, popular songs everyone knew. Pretty soon everyone was singing with her—and they kept right on singing—for forty-five minutes.</p>
  
  <p>The kids are wonderful! They don't expect you to be an artist—or put on a terrific act. All they want—and the thing they appreciate most—is for you to be yourself—regular! </p>
  
  <p>My sister, Rita, and I, and Lela Anderson dropped in at March Field one morning. We had no show. We'd had no breakfast, and we'd been driving for hours in an open car. We walked across the field—it seemed miles—in more wind. The rats and hairpins had long since fallen from our fancy hair-dos. But as far as the boys were concerned, we were positive okay. They were glad to see us. They made us feel like we were queens. We were simply visiting. We had no act, nothing planned. But we walked into one of the wards, and Rita started things with the crack: "Say, boys, six doctors rushed us at the front office. They said, 'Okay, casualties ... what campaigns, please ...' and ordered us to this ward!"</p>
  
  <p>The boys roared. And Rita kept right on cracking. We walked through so many wards, we were limp. The docs finally put us in wheelchairs and tagged us the "Sulpha Sisters"—fastest cure they'd ever had in the hospital. By the time we'd completed our "visit" we'd covered 26 acres!</p>
  
  <p>The incredibly high morale of our body who have returned from Attu, from the Marshalls, from the South Pacific—everywhere, is so wonderful that it cannot be described in words. Their great courage, the philosophy they've adopted, their sense of humor is inspirational for all of us. Some of them are expressing themselves in writing—songs, stories, poems. I'd like to conclude by letting you read one of the latter, written by Lieutenant W. D. Del Maestro at Norco Naval Hospital who expresses, far better than I, just how they feel about—

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Background: The article here describes events on the set of the movie <em>On Dangerous Ground</em> (1951), starring Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan, and directed by Nicholas Ray. The movie is referred to by its working title, <em>Mad With Much Heart</em>. </p>

<p>Just before starting her work in this movie, Lupino had completed producing and directing her third independent production, <em>Outrage</em>. As we will see, even while acting, Lupino had her mind on her future productions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Los Angeles Daily News, May 8, 1950</em></strong></p>
  
  <p><em>by Darr Smith</em><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1555679200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1555679200b img-responsive" alt="Darr Smith article in Los Angeles Daily News for May 8, 1950" title="Darr Smith article in Los Angeles Daily News for May 8, 1950" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1555679200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>
  
  <p>On the set of RKO's picture, "Mad With Much Heart," there are two directors—one active, one inactive. Nick Ray, tall, quiet and toothy, is the active one, while Actress Ida Lupino is inactive—at least as far as directing the picture is concerned. As an actress in it, she is anything but inactive.</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino has her own picture producing organization called The Filmakers, and, as most people know, she has been functioning as the director of its product.</p>
  
  <p>In "Mad With Much Heart" she has been intently observing the technique of Ray, who just happens to be one of the best directors in the directing dodge.</p>
  
  <p>One morning last week after a difficult scene, Miss Lupino, a slim-hipped wench who speaks in what might be called a whisky baritone and who acts as though she had at least two built-in furnaces, threw her arms around Ray's neck and said:</p>
  
  <p>"Oh, darling! You're wonderful!"</p>
  
  <p><strong>The fan</strong></p>
  
  <p>Then she backed away from him and said: "If we're going to make love, let's get over in front of that fan."</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino turned to us and added, "He's wonderful, but he's also a bum. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to expose him.</p>
  
  <p>"He read the script for Filmakers' next picture-which just happens to be called 'The Lowdown' and said that there was one part in it he'd like to play.</p>
  
  <p>"And he was so right! It is perfect for him—a guy who's tall, suave and bad. So every time we thought of the part we thought of Nick Ray. Then we started to do some rewrites on the script and we did them thinking of this lug.</p>
  
  <p>"Now the part is tailored to him and he's being coy. He won't say yes or no. His agent says Nick will cost a lot of money as an actor. I say he won't because even though his salary is established as a director, it's not established as an actor. I say we should get him for peanuts because of all the trouble he's already cost us."</p>
  
  <p>Nick Ray broke in with: "When do you start?"</p>
  
  <p>"You know very well when we start, but you've said you'd be cutting this picture then. Besides, I don't know whether I want to direct you as an actor. You'd probably sit back and think, 'There she goes, lousing it up again!'"</p>
  
  <p>"No," said Nick, "I'd probably be thinking, 'What a great actress she is!'"</p>
  
  <p>From Miss Lupino: "Drop dead!"</p>
  
  <p><strong>New shot</strong></p>
  
  <p>An assistant director saved anybody from doing anything violent by announcing that everything was ready for the next shot. They all trooped off to accomplish it.</p>
  
  <p>The fun was over and the serious work was at hand. </p>
  
  <p>Ray, a quiet man, as we have said, practically whispers directions to his actors. He took co-star Robert Ryan aside and solemnly whispered in his ear. Ryan nodded. Then Ray went to Miss Lupino and whispered to her. She nodded; Ray moved back behind the camera, and the scene was shot.</p>
  
  <p>They did it again. More whispering. Miss Lupino took more preparation, and it was done. </p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino threw her arms around Ray's neck again and said, "Darling, how about it? Will you play the part?"</p>
  
  <p>Ray said, "Let's move over in front of the fan where I can think."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Post-script: <em>The Lowdown</em>, after multiple re-writes over several years, eventually became <em>Private Hell 36</em> (1954)—one of the last films produced by The Filmakers. Lupino did not direct it, but starred in it with Steve Cochran and then-husband Howard Duff. Nicholas Ray did not play a part in that film.</p>

  <p>HOLLYWOOD, Jan. 15. — Ida Lupino is known in Hollywood as the girl who loves to suffer for her art.</p>
  
  <p>In "Greed," her latest sadistic cinema showcase, Ida sprained her sacroiliac and broke two ribs. In "Roadhouse," Robert Widmark [sic, Richard Widmark] smacked her face and loosed two front teeth. In "In Our Time," Ida passed out with suffocation from a fire. </p>
  
  <p>"In 'Deep Valley,' says Ida, "my big toe was almost severed on a rock and it was hanging by a thread. I couldn't feel it because it was so cold." This was the movie where Ida caught pneumonia from wearing a thin cotton dress in the snow at Big Bear. </p>
  
  <p>"And the payoff is,'" continues Miss Lupino, "when you get through doing it; the public says: 'Aw, that wasn't her; she used a stunt man.' "</p>
  
  <p>"Well, don't you?" queries this skeptical reporter.</p>
  
  <p>"Sure I do for the long shote," replies the always candid star. "I have a wonderful stunt girl who walks like me and thinks like I do and gets hurt in exactly the same places that I do.</p>
  
  <p>"In 'Greed,' for example, she tore her ribs, hurt her knee and cut her elbow in the same places that I did, She did 'em in the long shots, me in the close shots. </p>
  
  <p>"Something more should be done," asserts Ida, "for the unsung heroes of pictures—the stunt people who take these terrible risks. They do such horrible things, risking their lives for these stunts. Through the years they've taught me how to do them. When I can, I do my own stunts. It makes a better picture."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It all started when Ida rebelled against cute ingenue roles on the screen. She came to Hollywood from England at the age of 15 to star in "Alice in Wonderland" with her father's final advice in her ear: "No daughter of mine is going to be an acrobat."</p>
  
  <p>"That," says Ida, "was because his family (the famous Lupino family) had been acrobats, tumblers and circus performers for centuries back. But just to be sure that his two daughters were equipped for the hazards of the acting profession, poppa Stanley Lupino had them taught how to take falls.</p>
  
  <p>"And how right he was. In my very first picture, 'Her First Affair,' before I even came to Hollywood I had to fall from a three-story building on fire into a lake below. I was 13 at the time."</p>
  
  <p>In Hollywood, the producer of "Alice in Wonderland" took one listen at Ida's deep voice, "looked at my face and said it was 'off beat.' He gave the part to Charlotte Henry instead."</p>
  
  <p>"For years I was stuck in ingenue roles," says Ida who still has that angelic look which now adds a double impact to the tough, witchy roles she plays.</p>
  
  <p>"My first crack at an action picture in Hollywood was 'Come on Marines,' with Ann Sheridan. I was 16 then, and Annie and I lived together. She had just won a 'Search For Beauty' competition. We were both very discouraged with Hollywood, and both wanted to go home and raise families."</p>
  
  <p>Now, 16 years later, they both will probably get their wish, Ida recently married family-loving man Collier Young, after an unhappy marital session with Louis Hayward, Annie is about to become the bride of Steve Hannagan, after two marriage flops with Ed Norris and George Brent.</p>
  
  <p>"In 'Come on Marines,' continues Ida, "I had to stand in an ice-cold mountain lake, I caught a terrible cold that put me in bed for a month.</p>
  
  <p>"In 'In Our Time,' there was a big scene where we all had to fall on the ground while we were strafed by planes." In pictures, when a plane strafes you, it isn't done by the plane. The ground is dynamited and at a given signal it pops off to coincide with the machine gun in the plane,</p>
  
  <p>"You have to be sure to fall in the right place," says Ida, "or you get dynamited. A couple of us in that picture fell in the wrong places and injured our hands."</p>
  
  <p>In the same picture Ida and Paul Henreid had to dash out of a burning house through a chalk-marked passaged. Ida slipped, swallowed smoke and scared herself into a faint.</p>
  
  <p>"It was almost funny in 'Roadhouse,'" declares Ida, who has a British sense of humor. "Richard Widmark had to sock me. He hated to hit women in real life, and he missed me on the timing. So I got it full on the chin. It jarred my neck and loosened my teeth.</p>
  
  <p>"Then Cornel Wilde had to swing on Widmark. He missed, went into Widmark's eye and put two of his fingers out. Then Celeste Holm ran through the woods breathing so heavily that she passed out and we all landed in the studio hospital!"</p>
  
  <p>The torn ribs on "Greed" happened when Glenn Ford pushed a big rock at Ida on a mountain path. In avoiding the rock, Ida caught her heel in her long skirt.</p>
  
  <p>"In saving myself, part of the rock went into my rib and I had a bump on my head the size of an egg, to say nothing of being black and blue from head to foot," explains Ida. Would you risk all this—for a fortune?</p>

                                <p>While I am trying to ready a longer piece, here is a short post featuring guest columnist Ida Lupino. </p>

<p>She was filling in for the regular columnist of the Hollywood Citizen-News on July 27, 1945. At this time, Lupino had recently returned from nearly two months touring the northeastern U.S.—mostly visiting hospitals of the war wounded, and also making some publicity appearances for her just-released comedy, <em>Pillow to Post</em>. She was about to start work on her next film, <em>The Man I Love</em>. </p>

<p>Late in her trip she had injured herself and then collapsed from exhaustion due to the busy schedule during a heat wave. The memory of this "abominable climate" was clearly near the top of her mind when she returned to California.</p>

<p>A brief excerpt from a serious portion of this generally light-hearted essay:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The war in Europe ended while I was away from Hollywood. 
  Only in the hospitals I visited, particularly those mental wards I mentioned, the war isn't over.
  It isn't going to be over for some of those men—ever.
  I'm going visiting that was again, quite soon I hope and I think that every Hollywood player who can go is needed now as ever before.
  We are going to be needed, too, to add whatever gayety and relaxation we can
  for the sick and wounded for a long, long time to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See below for the entire thing. It is a fun read.</p>
