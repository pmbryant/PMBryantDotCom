		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b img-responsive" alt="Bogart.SperberLax.Cover" title="Bogart.SperberLax.Cover" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>A few weeks ago I started reading my first biography of Humphrey Bogart. This book was written by Ann Sperber and Eric Lax, published in the late '90s, and appears to be very thoroughly researched—especially regarding anything that happened at Warner Bros. So I was curious if they mentioned anything about the dog in <em>High Sierra</em> and his relationship to Bogart.</p>

<p>Given my <a href="../../../2020/05/pard-the-dog-frm-high-sierra-was-it-really-bogarts-dog.html">earlier research</a> that uncovered that Zero, the dog that played Pard, was not owned by Bogart at the time of filming <em>High Sierra</em>, I was not expecting to find anything in this thoroughly-documented biography. But, in fact, there actually is a mention of Zero in this book, and he is specified as Bogart's dog! </p>

<p>This was troubling to me. My research, based on contemporary newspaper articles, seemed highly unlikely to be outright incorrect. So I quickly turned to the end notes to try to find out the source for this brief mention.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="display: inline;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d img-responsive" alt="ZeroBogartFootnote.SperberLax" title="ZeroBogartFootnote.SperberLax" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d-500wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Ida Lupino!</p>

<p>That was certainly a surprise. She said this in a 1991 interview with author Ann Sperber, over 50 years after the filming of the movie. Given the time that had passed, and the lack of corroboration from sources of 1941, it seems clear this is a case of Lupino misremembering. </p>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="../../../2020/05/pard-the-dog-from-high-sierra-was-it-really-bogarts-dog.html">earlier post</a>, a newspaper story from 1941 had reported, second-hand, that Bogart sought (unsuccessfully) to purchase Zero the dog after the movie. If I may speculate, maybe that was true, maybe Bogart talked during the filming about a desire to own Zero, and maybe, over many decades, that became, in Lupino's mind, that Bogart actually owned Zero.</p>

<p>Due to the solid reputation of the Sperber-Lax biography of Bogart, could it be the original source of all the rumors about Bogart's ownership of Zero that have been repeated so often in internet writings and other sources over the last decade or so? I am inclined to believe so for the time being—pending further discoveries, of course.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Recently a wonderful, if brief, 1972 interview with Ida Lupino was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SF53ECpj1k">posted on YouTube</a>. This interview was part of the publicity surrounding the release of the film <em>Junior Bonner</em>. </p>

<p>The video is from the archives of a long-time television reporter named Bobbie Wygant. The sound quality drops in two or three places for a few seconds, but is mostly decipherable in those places with some effort. So I took the time to transcribe it for posterity and to save others the effort of trying to interpret the words in the tough spots.</p>

<p>Television interviews of Lupino are extremely hard to find these days. In fact, other than the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UgbgrLve7A&amp;t=16s">1958 <em>This is Your Life</em></a> episode, this is the only non-scripted television appearance of Lupino's that I've seen. So this is a real treasure!</p>

<p>Here is the transcript.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p><strong>Bobbie Wygant</strong>: As I said in the introduction, Miss Ida Lupino is returning to the motion picture screen after a 17-year absence. So Miss Lupino, it just has to be the first question—what was it about this role of Elvira that tempted you back to the screen?</p>

<p><strong>Ida Lupino</strong>: Well first of all my agents said, ‘We want to send a script over to you. Mr. Joe Wizan is producing it. Mr Sam Peckinpah is directing it. Steve McQueen and Robert Preston are starring in it and would you like to play Steve McQueen’s mother?’ And without reading the script, I said, ‘I’ll play his grandmother!’  (Laughter) With that lineup—most definitely.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Well I’ve seen the picture and you’d have to have lots and lots of makeup to play his grandmother. I can tell you that.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Well I wouldn’t say that. You’re very kind.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: No, I’ve seen the picture. Now, the other thing that I would like to know is that -- the first day you went back on the set, were you at all nervous about it, Miss Lupino?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Oh yes, very, very. I think when you’ve been back of the camera for a long time and you haven’t made a motion picture for so long, there’s that natural nervousness, you know—your first day and… first couple of days.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: What were you shooting that first day on the set?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Well, actually, I was very lucky. It was the rodeo stuff. (Laughs) And I didn’t do much except stand in crowds and wave to my husband Robert Preston, who plays Ace Bonner. And who is marvelous in it.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: I’ll drink to that. He is, indeed.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: [?] I didn’t say that.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: You’ve been directing and writing for some 17 years now. When you first wanted to be a director, was it a difficult thing to convince people that you could and to give you a chance?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Well, actually I never wanted to be a director. It was just an accident. I had co-written a screenplay for a picture called ‘Not Wanted’ and was co-producing it. And our director unfortunately had a heart attack suddenly. But it had to be made for 125 thousand dollars in ten days. And we couldn’t afford another director. So I took over. Fortunately for us the picture was a success. I said, well that’s fine. I’ll go home and write some lyrics and music—which I like to do! And… but the moneymen said no, I had to direct the second one. And then it was like a snowball and you know, it kept on. And then Howard Hughes took over our company, and he insisted I direct the first three with RKO. And that’s how this ugly thing happened of me getting in back of the camera.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: But when you took over, Miss Lupino, that is really an about-face for an actress, isn’t it? You’ve been in front of the camera, but then it’s a whole ‘nother world in back of the camera, isn’t it?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Yes, a whole ‘nother world. A very good world, though. There’s a lot of nice people.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: It wasn’t a difficult adjustment for you?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Yes, I was terrified. Absolutely terrified. I was never off the phone with our editor saying ‘Have I got him coming in the room in the right direction? Is she looking in the right direction?’ I was like a bird trying, you know, trying to fly for the first time—</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Did you make any goofs?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: I made so many, I can’t even enumerate. (Laughs) But you mean on the first picture?</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Oh yeah I was always calling him up and saying, ‘You know I think I’ve reversed myself here.’ And he’d say, ‘Yes you have’. So I’d have to quickly shoot it over again.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: I’m sure you’re not the first director that’s done that––</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: You know, directions in camera––</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Yes. Now. You surely… Of all the motion pictures you’ve made, Miss Lupino, there are some that you would probably like to be remembered for more than others. Which are the ones you’d most like to be remembered for?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: You mean as an actress or director?</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: As an actress, uhuh, as an actress.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: There are so many I want to forget. (Laughter)</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Do you care to name any of those? (Laughs)</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Nooo, I’d rather not. I’d rather not.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Then the ones you’d really like to be remembered for—which ones?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: As a performer, well there’s only one I really cared enough about—that I thought I was half-way decent in, and that was a thing called “Ladies in Retirement”.  It was a New York stage play and I did —(?)—. And I thought I gave a fairly decent performance. And I didn’t shudder when I saw myself—for a change! (Laughs)</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Who were the other people in that?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: It was Elsa Lanchester. And Edith Barrett. Louis Hayward. Evelyn Keyes. And me playing the murderess.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Miss Lupino, I know you have to go now and dress for the new world premiere tonight—. I do thank you for taking the time to talk with us. And please, don’t stay away for another 17 years, will you?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: No, I won’t. If Mr Wizar will have me back playing a grandmother or an aunt, I’d be delighted! (Laughs)</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Thank you very much, Miss Ida Lupino.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Recently I uncovered some fascinating information on a forgotten aspect of Ida Lupino's multi-faceted career. Aside from her well-known contributions as a film and television actor, writer, producer, and director, she also co-authored a musical comedy that was <em>produced on stage</em> in 1949. </p>

<p>The stage production was the revelation, since it appears to have gone down a memory black hole. I have not seen such a production mentioned in any of the books and articles I have read about Ida over the last few years, even those by her biographers.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino had serious ambitions to write and produce a stage musical comedy, and she had worked quite a bit in that direction in the 1930s and '40s in her spare time. So it is pleasing to discover that this ambition of hers was realized, adding another item to long list of her show business accomplishments.</p>

<p>My presumption that none of Ida's stage musical works had been produced was based in part on <a href="https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/03/27/apple-tree-farm-a-script-by-stanley-lupino-with-revisions-by-ida-lupino/">a 2014 article</a> by MoMA associate curator Anne Morra — an informative article about a script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> that MoMA had recently acquired. At the end, Morra relates that "<em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was never realized as a stage or screen musical". </p>

<p>From my own readings, I knew <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was the play that Ida was most determined to see produced. She had taken time off from acting and spent several months of 1946 — near the height of her Hollywood stardom — with the lofty ambition of getting it to Broadway. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-classic-hollywood-lupino-centennial-20180216-story.html" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20264e2dd9ce3200d img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Stanley and Ida Lupino in 1935 (LA Times)" title="Stanley and Ida Lupino in 1935 (LA Times)" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20264e2dd9ce3200d-450wi" /></a>This play was something she clearly cared deeply about. Ida's late father Stanley had written the original book, and there was no one Ida was more determined to please than him. Her attempt to adapt Stanley's book, write a score, and produce the play may have been a way to honor him after his early death in 1942. Morra mentions that Stanley's script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was the only script that Ida retained to the end of her life. </p>

<p>Ida Lupino's push to make <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> a reality on the stage may have begun in 1943, the year after her father's death. Late that year, an item in <em>Photoplay</em> magazine relates, "Ida, by the way, is working hard on that musical comedy (she wrote all the music for it) she expects to stage very soon. Producer Lupino! Not bad." This item is consistent with <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>, though there is a chance it could be something else — she dabbled in music constantly at that time.</p>

<p>Events in Ida's personal life likely distracted her soon after that. Her husband, Louis Hayward, returned from the South Pacific a war hero, but devastated by his experiences. Helping him recover, then dealing with the break-up of their marriage in subsequent months took virtually all her energy. </p>

<p><em>Apple Tree Farm</em> doesn't re-emerge as a public priority for Ida until she was working on the film <em>Escape Me Never</em> with Errol Flynn in late 1945 and early '46. At that time, she energetically resumed work on the musical comedy. The press reported that she had written music and lyrics for five numbers and was aiming for it to be on Broadway in the fall.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino and Bill MacIlwinen work on Apple Tree Farm (Chicago Tribune, 1948)" title="Ida Lupino and Bill MacIlwinen work on Apple Tree Farm (Chicago Tribune, 1948)" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b-450wi" /></a>Around this same time, she had invited several men and women to share her household due to the post-war housing shortage. One of these, a war veteran named Bill MacIlwinen, was a talented musician, and in him, Ida found a willing and able collaborator on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>.</p>

<p>In a March 9 column, Hedda Hopper wrote that Ida was taking a three-month leave-of-absence from making pictures at Warner Bros. in order to work on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. She would "adapt it for American audiences and to collaborate on the score with an ex-soldier". Ida planned to have a cast of "unknowns" and to do a tryout on the west coast before taking it to Broadway. </p>

<p>A week later, another Hollywood columnist said Ida was "working like mad" with Bill MacIlwinen. They were expecting to finish in late April, after which they would go to New York City to sell it to Broadway. Late in March, Louella Parsons wrote that "Warners have taken an option on Ida Lupino's musical, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>, for a movie. It's all ready for its Santa Barbara tryout." </p>

<p>Next, the Hollywood press reported that "Ida has signed radio comedian Jackson McCarthy to play in it," and that she and MacIlwinen had fourteen musical numbers written for the play. Singer Tony Martin was said to be ready to try out a couple of the songs on his radio show. (I would be fascinated to know if this actually happened.)</p>

<p>So as of April 1946, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> appeared to be on track for a production in Santa Barbara in the near future. Ida and Bill were proud of their work, as columnist Erskine Johnson discovered while vising the "Lupino Asylum", as Ida referred to her household, on "a rather dull afternoon", with only 10 or 12 people there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I want you to meet Bill MacIlwinen," Ida said. "He was a lieutenant in the Navy. Now we're collaborating on a Broadway musical — 'Apple Tree Farm'. Bill is writing the music, and I'm writing the lyrics. Listen! — he's playing the piano in the living room now."</p>
  
  <p>We listened. Bill was an excellent pianist.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>"You must hear some of our songs from 'Apple Tree Farm'," Ida said. We all rushed into the living room. Bill played and Ida sang.</p>
  
  <p>"My sister's husband is designing the hats for the show," Ida said, after singing four numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next on the agenda was Ida's New York sales trip, scheduled for May 7.</p>

<p>Then something happened — at the last minute, Ida Lupino postponed her trip. </p>

<p>The reported reason for the cancellation was a "serious throat ailment". Soon,  columnist Edwin Schallert expressed doubt that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> would go further any time soon, as Ida was going to be too busy with film work. One of the films Schallert mentioned for Ida never happened, while the other, <em>Deep Valley</em>, didn't end up going before the cameras for four months.</p>

<p>On June 4, columnist Harrison Carroll reported, "Ida Lupino will do a complete re-write on the book of her musical <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. She plans to publish several songs in the meantime." </p>

<p>At that point, at least in the press, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> goes dark.</p>

<p>Six months later, by which time Ida Lupino was starring in <em>Deep Valley</em>, a United Press article about the madhouse of assorted people at Ida's home quotes her saying she is working on a musical for which "the play was written by my father." Signs of life? Or old news?</p>

<p>Another eighteen months — then, in April 1948, a Chicago Tribune layout on Ida includes an undated photograph of her working with Bill MacIlwinen on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. Again, is this signs of life or an old picture? </p>

<p>By late 1948, Ida had married Collier Young, and her household reverted to that of a traditional couple — no longer a motley assortment of people coming and going. Soon, she and Young would be writing and producing their own movies. The time for a stage production of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> had come and gone — or so I would have thought.</p>

<p>But then, on January 28, 1949, just a few days after Ida announced her plans to produce a film about unwed mothers for her independent company — the film that became <em>Not Wanted</em> and launched her celebrated directing career — an item appears in the Raleigh News and Observer with the headline "Ida Lupino's Play Will Be Presented":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chapel Hill, Jan. 27 — "Apple Tree Farm", an original play by Stanley and Ida Lupino of Hollywood, with music by Bill McIlwinnen [sic] of Fayetteville, will go into production next week on the University of North Carolina campus. </p>
  
  <p>The modern musical fantasy will be given here April 4, 5, 6, under the sponsorship of the Laboratory theatre of the Carolina Playmakers for the benefit of the Koch Memorial Fund.</p>
  
  <p>Martin Jacobs of Greensboro, who staged last year's first Memorial Fund show, "Sweep It Clean," will again be director.</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino, the famous movie star, has indicated she expects to attend the performance in Chapel Hill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amazing news!</p>

<p>As I examined the newspaper archives from North Carolina as the April production date approached, I was concerned. Did this actually happen? Did something arise to prevent it?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Apple Tree Farm rehearsal (Daily Tar Heel, Apr 6, 1949)" title="Apple Tree Farm rehearsal (Daily Tar Heel, Apr 6, 1949)" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b-450wi" /></a>But nothing got in the way — it actually happened! The original planned run of three nights was extended to five: April 4-8, 1949.</p>

<p>Ida was unable to attend the performance due to her duties on her film, <em>Not Wanted</em>, which now included directing due to the illness of the assigned director, Elmer Clifton. She did do an interview on a CBS coast-to-coast broadcast the day before the premiere in North Carolina. And she and her friend Harry Mines sent telegrams of congratulations to the cast after the first night's performance. The reviews in the local newspapers were disappointed with the book, but enthusiastic about the music and songs. </p>

<p>Ida was not yet done with <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. At the time of the North Carolina production, she was reported to be planning a meeting with 20th Century-Fox about a script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. A few months later, when Ida was acting in the film <em>Woman in Hiding</em>, working with director Michael Gordon, this item appeared in papers: "Miss Lupino owns a property she'd like to see staged, and Gordon, a Broadway veteran, is, she sighs, the man to stage it." What else could that be but <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>? Ida clearly did not relinquish her Broadway dreams easily.</p>

<p>The next month, Ida told a North Carolina reporter that she'd like to visit the state in near future to visit friends, including Bill MacIlwinen. "I'm still quite elated over Bill's and my collaboration on the musical comedy, <em>The Apple Tree Farm,</em> which the Carolina Playmakers produced this spring. Maybe we'll do another."</p>

<p>And then <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> really does go dark — eventually falling into that memory black hole.</p>

<p>Morra's article suggests that Ida worked on a screenplay version in the 1950s. By that point, Ida was heavily into film producing, directing, and writing. As her Broadway initiative kept hitting dead ends, it makes sense that she would decide to produce it herself in the medium she was expert at and had some control over. She had so many other projects going, though, that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> does not seem to have gotten much attention at that point, even from her.</p>

<p>As the years passed, Ida Lupino retained the script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> — alone amongst the numerous ones that she had collaborated on through her decades in Hollywood. It was, after all, one her father had given her.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Let's try something fairly straightforward to get this blog back on track. What were my favorite movies that I watched in August that were new to me?</p>

<p>Of the 21 new watches, 6 made the finals, with at least 4 stars in my Letterboxd rating. In the order I watched them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Craig's Wife (1936)</li>
<li>It Should Happen To You (1954)</li>
<li>In the Heat of the Night (1967)</li>
<li>Sherlock, Jr. (1924)</li>
<li>Gold Rush Maisie (1940)</li>
<li>Woman in Hiding (1949)</li>
</ul>

<p>The bottom of these is <em>It Should Happen to You</em>, which was fabulous for 80% of the film. Alas, it suffers from a very weak denouement, with Judy Holliday's character suddenly throwing away her ambition and uniqueness to fall into a routine romantic ending.</p>

<p>Moving up, next is <em>Craig's Wife</em>, starring Rosalind Russell and directed by Dorothy Arzner. This is an excellent film, but does have some relatively  small flaws, including a slow opening and a heavy-handed message.</p>

<p><em>Sherlock, Jr</em> and <em>In the Heat of the Night</em> are next. Both are great watches, albeit extremely different from each other. Neither film entirely suits my tastes, which may explain why I do not rate them even higher.</p>

<p><em>Woman in Hiding</em> is my second favorite new watch of last month. It is a suspenseful, engaging thriller from the opening. And it has the wonderful Ida Lupino in the lead role, which is another huge plus for me.</p>

<p>Finally, my absolute favorite new watch in August was the third film in the Maisie series <em>Gold Rush Maisie</em>. I had watched the first two Maisie movies back-to-back well over a year ago. The original, <em>Maisie</em>, was fabulous. The second, <em>Congo Maisie</em>, was entertaining, but didn't inspire me to move on to the others. That was a mistake, as the third film is the best yet and  hooked me on Ann Sothern's "Maisie" character and how good-hearted and empathetic she is---a super-hero without super-powers. It was heart-breaking to see her drive off alone at the end of the movie, leaving her new friends, setting off on her next adventure.</p>

                                <p>If you want to learn more about Ida Lupino and her fascinating life and career, here are the essential books:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Ida Lupino: Beyond the Camera</em>, by Mary Ann Anderson with Ida Lupino, originally published 2011. 100th birthday special edition published 2018.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the closest thing we will ever have to an Ida Lupino memoir. Alas it is thin on detail on Ida's life prior to 1983, and some of her early career detail appears chronologically inconsistent (likely relying on Ida's memory decades later). Yet this is a fascinating and crucial book for anyone who wants to get an understanding of Ida as a person. Mary Ann Anderson knew Ida better than anyone from 1983 until Ida's death in 1995.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><em>Ida Lupino: A Biography</em>, by William Donati, originally published 1995.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>A wonderful and detailed biography, published shortly after Ida's death, by someone who clearly highly respected her, faults and all. If you read Anderson's book, you learn that Ida and Donati had a falling out. You would never know from reading Donati's book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Supplemental material:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Ida Lupino, Director: Her Art and Resilience in Times of Transition</em>, by Therese Grisham, Julie Grossman, published 2017.</li>
</ul>

<p>An academic-style book on Ida's directing career, both film and television.</p>

<ul>
<li>_Mr. Adams and Eve, Illustrated*, by Mary Ann Anderson, published 2010.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>More stories straight from the source, and lots of great pictures as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><em>The Making of the Hitch-Hiker, Illustrated</em>, by Mary Ann Anderson, published 2013.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>More from Anderson, so always worthwhile.</p>

                                <p>Ida Lupino directed a large number of television shows on numerous programs between the late ‘50s and the late ‘60s, including shows such as <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, <em>Have Gun Will Travel</em>, <em>The Fugitive</em>, <em>Thriller</em>, and <em>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</em>.</p>

<p>This prolific TV directing career began in early 1956 with a half-hour episode of <em>Screen Directors Playhouse</em>. The show, titled <em>No. 5 Checked Out</em>, was based on a story Ida wrote. It starred Teresa Wright, William Talman, and Peter Lorre.</p>

                                <p><em>Pillow to Post</em> (1945). A rare and very fun Ida Lupino comedy film, where she plays a traveling saleslady posing as a military spouse in order to find a place to sleep in the wartime housing shortage.</p>

<p>From the Donati bio of Ida:</p>

<p>“Ida told [director] Vincent Sherman that Pillow to Post brought her more fan mail than any other film in her career. Servicemen wrote to her from around the world.”</p>

<p>Vincent Sherman, quoted in Mary Ann Anderson’s book:</p>

<p>“Soldiers just loved this film. Ida was delightful. There wasn’t any kind of part that she couldn’t have done, comedy or drama.”</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>After her production company The Filmakers folded in 1954, Ida Lupino was invited by Dick Powell, David Niven, and Charles Boyer to join their regular television production, <em>Four Star Playhouse</em>.</p>

<p>Her new television career eventually led to her starring in a hit sitcom called <em>Mr. Adams and Eve</em> for two years in 1957-58, receiving an Emmy nomination in the process. She starred with her current husband, Howard Duff, while her ex-husband and former partner at The Filmakers, Collier Young, was the producer.</p>

<p>Ida said: “We liked to think it was a sophisticated kind of comedy showing the behind the scenes antics of a couple of movie stars.”</p>

<p>Three episodes of the 66 filmed are on YouTube.</p>

<p>In one episode I haven’t found, Ida plays a dual role: her usual character, “Eve, the movie star”, and “Ida Lupino, the director” who was brought in to direct the fictional acting couple. I would love to be able to see that episode!</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>After a tremendous run of successful roles at Warner Bros. in 1940-41, Ida Lupino starred in <em>Ladies in Retirement</em> (1941) for Columbia—-opposite her then-husband Louis Hayward. This is an excellent, tense thriller that deserves more attention.</p>

<p>The lead role in the original hit play was played to great acclaim by Flora Robson and meant for a woman of sixty. Director Charles Vidor imagined the film character to be forty. Ida was 23 and an eight-year veteran of motion pictures.</p>

<p>Columbia mogul Harry Cohn exclaimed to the producer, “You are out of your mind choosing this child to play that role.”</p>

<p>As William Donati writes in his bio of Lupino: “Ida's performance was one of her greatest. Her restraint as the cold-blooded Ellen made her all the more frightening.”</p>
