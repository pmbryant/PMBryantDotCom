A few weeks before filming of &lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt; began in November, 1941, Ida was quoted saying: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Everyone has been hoping to get the lead opposite Gabin in his first picture. 
  It may be a little catty, but I&#39;m very happy I got it. 
  &lt;em&gt;(Knoxville News-Sentinel, Oct. 5, 1941)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt; project had been announced seven months earlier, in April 1941, but had been immediately put on hold to allow Gabin several months in which to learn sufficient English. So during that time, which actresses besides Ida were strongly considered for the role opposite Gabin? Here are the candidates I have heard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joan Bennett&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d-pi&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Joan Bennett&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d-120wi&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&quot; title=&quot;Joan Bennett&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In a short film on the making of &lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt;, produced in 2008 for the DVD release, well-known film historian and TCM personality Robert Osborne gives this information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The leading lady of the film was actually supposed to be Joan Bennett, 
  who had a contract with 20th Century-Fox. But she got pregnant. 
  So what they did is they borrowed Ida Lupino from Warner Bros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t have access to internal studio documents, but from publicly available information, I have not been able to corroborate any of this. Taking the items from Osborne&#39;s statement in reverse order: first, Lupino had a separate contract with 20th Century-Fox and so was not &quot;borrowed&quot;. Second, Joan Bennett was making films almost continually throughout 1941. Any pregnancy she may have had did not interfere with the making of any of the other several films she did that year. Also note that her next child was born in mid-1943, a year-and-a-half after &lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt; was in production. Finally, I have not found any mention of Bennett&#39;s name in connection with &lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt; in those newspapers or trade papers whose archives are available online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not, of course, preclude the possibility that Joan Bennett was the studio&#39;s initial choice internally. But the apparent factual problems with the rest of Osborne&#39;s statement make me skeptical of the claim that Bennett was ever the top choice. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to find more conclusive evidence one way or the other at some point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linda Darnell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b-popup&quot; onclick=&quot;window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Linda Darnell&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b-120wi&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&quot; title=&quot;Linda Darnell&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt; was first announced in mid-April 1941, shortly after Jean Gabin arrived in Hollywood after escaping his French homeland, which had been conquered by the German army the previous summer. No other definitive cast members were mentioned in the announcement, but influential Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons offered this tidbit: &quot;Don&#39;t say I told you—but Linda Darnell is the leading candidate for the femme role.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darnell was 17 years old and still in high school in early 1941. Despite her youth, she had made a big splash over the previous two years at 20th Century—co-starring in several significant films with established star Tyrone Power, including &lt;em&gt;The Mark of Zorro&lt;/em&gt; (1940) and &lt;em&gt;Blood and Sand&lt;/em&gt; (1941). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, after that initial hint from Louella Parsons, Darnell&#39;s name is never again mentioned in associate with &lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt;—at least not in anything I have been able to find. But there was another possibility that may have paired Darnell with Gabin in his first Hollywood movie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a brief time in late May and early June, rumors hit the press that Gabin could be the star of fellow Frenchman Jean Renoir&#39;s first American film, &lt;em&gt;Swamp Water&lt;/em&gt;. Darnell was lined up for the leading lady. By mid-June, however, this was shot down and &lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt; was again first on tap for Gabin, with Ida Lupino mentioned as his co-star. Darnell was dropped from the &lt;em&gt;Swamp Water&lt;/em&gt; cast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ida Lupino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d-pi&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ida Lupino&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d-120wi&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&quot; title=&quot;Ida Lupino&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After Louella Parsons&#39; one-time mention of Linda Darnell in April, the next woman named for Gabin&#39;s co-star was Ida Lupino. On April 23, barely a week after &lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt; was first announced, a brief item in the Los Angeles Times entitled &quot;Gabin&#39;s Luck&quot; said &quot;Ida Lupino is reported scheduled to appear opposite Jean Gabin in &#39;Moontide&#39;, his first film for 20th Century-Fox, which is tabbed to start shooting in September.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s that, then. Ida had won the role almost immediately, even though the film was still many months away from shooting due to Gabin&#39;s need to perfect his English. If Linda Darnell or Joan Bennett or anyone else was considered, it was not for long and none of the competitors&#39; press agents were able to get traction in print. Is that the end of the story? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly, but not quite. Six months is an eternity in Hollywood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ginger Rogers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d-pi&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ginger Rogers&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d-120wi&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;&quot; title=&quot;Ginger Rogers&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On May 5, columnist Louella Parsons struck again, writing that Gabin, who was seen around town with Ginger Rogers frequently at this time, wanted Ginger for his co-star and was working on convincing her to take the role. Parsons mentions Ida Lupino as &quot;also in the running&quot;. This was just a few months after Ginger Rogers had won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her work the previous year in &lt;em&gt;Kitty Foyle&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, Parsons&#39; reporting led to nothing, as Ginger Rogers&#39; name not does not appear again in connection with the &lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt; role. Soon Gabin was seen all around town with Marlene Dietrich. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to Ida Lupino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By July 1941, still several months ahead of the scheduled production date, Ida Lupino appears to have been firmly established as Gabin&#39;s co-star—both their names are included when 20th Century-Fox hypes their next season&#39;s films. And while circumstances could certainly have changed after that point, they did not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw at the very beginning of this essay, in October, Ida, who was then in a months-long dispute with Warner Bros. over the roles they were assigning her, was publicly expressing her pleasure with the role 20th Century-Fox had given her. When filming of &lt;em&gt;Moontide&lt;/em&gt; finally began in November, Ida Lupino was on the job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;asset-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b-pi&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin in Moontide&quot; class=&quot;asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b-500wi&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; title=&quot;Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin in Moontide&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Honor Among Lovers (1931) was the fifth of Ginger Rogers&#39; 73 films and the one with her smallest role. But it is a very entertaining film nonetheless, starring Claudette Colbert and Fredric March and directed by Dorothy Arzner.</p>
<p>I just watched it tonight for the first time--on a copy with very deteriorated video quality such that it was frequently hard to make out the actors&#39; faces.</p>
<p>Given that it&#39;s a very good film, I was happy to discover that it has apparently been restore<span class="text_exposed_show">d by UCLA and is being shown there in September as part of an Arzner retrospective. </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>I&#39;ve found older news items about similar Arzner retrospectives in other locations, so hopefully we can get the chance to see the restored version ourselves at some point.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Professional Sweetheart. RKO, 1933. A young Ginger Rogers stars in this comedy about a star radio singer trying to break out of the confines of her image as the &#39;Purity Girl&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several excellent actors and comedians in supporting roles in this film--notably Frank McHugh, Zasu Pitts, and Franklin Pangborn. And they all all great. Yet Ginger dominates the film in the role of the spoiled, manipulative, overgrown adolescent celebrity radio singer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, for those of u&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;s who thoroughly enjoy Ginger&#39;s singing, her voice is dubbed by someone with a very different style (Etta Moten). This is fortunately the only film where that was done. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of the film is extremely funny and entertaining. Alas, the last few minutes don&#39;t make much sense. Ginger&#39;s character undergoes a sudden personality transplant. The script suggests that she suddenly becomes a &quot;good woman&quot; after getting punched in the face by her new husband (played by Norman Foster).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the film up until then is so fun that the off-kilter finale can&#39;t spoil it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Perfect Strangers. Warner Brothers, 1950. Ginger Rogers stars with Dennis Morgan in this drama about a clandestine romance between two jury members who are married to other people. Morgan was also Ginger&#39;s love interest in her Academy Award-winning performance in Kitty Foyle a decade earlier.</p>
<p>The supporting cast includes Thelma Ritter and Alan Reed. I don&#39;t know Alan Reed as an actor aside from this film, but he later was the voice of Fred Flintstone. The director has the fa<span class="text_exposed_show">bulous name of Bretaigne Windust. He is most well-known for his Broadway work in the 1940s. </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>I really enjoyed the complicated dynamics of the love story between Ginger and Dennis Morgan. The film also focused on the interpersonal dynamics of a sequestered jury in a highly-publicized murder case, which leads to a number of very amusing situations. The character played Anthony Ross, who keeps hitting on Ginger unsuccessfully, was particularly entertaining. The courtroom protocol stuff could have been cut down substantially.</p>

Much of the negativity concerned the love story allegedly distracting from the courtroom story. I find that interpretation backwards. The love story *is* the movie. The rest is amusing and moderately interesting, but just background.</p>
<p>So if you want a courtroom drama uninterrupted by messy romance, this movie isn&#39;t for you. But if you care to watch a romantic drama that just happens to be set in a courtroom, then you may well enjoy this film after all!</p>

<p>When she was still a teenager and working on Broadway in Top Speed and Girl Crazy, Ginger Rogers made five films at Paramount&#39;s Astoria studios on Long Island. Young Man of Manhattan, which I wrote about a few weeks ago, was the first. Queen High, which we just watched this week, was the second. (Some sources say it&#39;s the third.)</p>
<p>Ginger is the female lead and gets to sing and dance a little, but the real stars are Charles Ruggles and Frank Morgan, who are very amusing actor<span class="text_exposed_show">s. (Morgan would become immortalized nine years later as the Wizard of Oz.) </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Ginger&#39;s character, once again with a high-pitched voice, though not so exaggerated as in Young Man, is referred to early on by Ruggles as a &quot;half-baked flapper.&quot; But the plot reveals her to be far more baked than that as she works to get her way this time around, unlike in the earlier film.</p>
<p>The film starts off great. It gets erratic in the second half, though, when some of the comedy gets a bit mean-spirited. Still, it is a fun movie -- primarily a comedic farce with some short musical bits thrown in. The copy I have suffers a bit in quality, but was still watchable.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll Be Seeing You. Selznick, 1944. This wartime romantic drama, starring Ginger Rogers and Joseph Cotten, is yet another of Ginger&#39;s films that deserves to be more widely recognized as a classic. Yet it clearly has a fair number of devoted fans. I had heard virtually universally positive things about this movie since learning about it last year. And I was not disappointed when we finally watched it last week.</p>
<p>It certainly is a tear-jerker. But not in an manipulative way. Gi<span class="text_exposed_show">nger plays a woman on a Christmas furlough from prison, while Joseph Cotten plays a traumatized soldier on a similar furlough from a psychiatric hospital. They meet and then the story unfolds. </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>The supporting cast, including a teenage Shirley Temple and the always-welcome Spring Byington, is excellent. With the Christmas and New Years setting, this has deservedly become a favorite holiday film of many of those who have been fortunate enough to discover it.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>From my Facebook archives, April 22, 2015:</p>
<p>Last week we watched a Paramount film from 1930 that may well be the oldest movie I&#39;ve yet seen in full (as I haven&#39;t yet gotten into silents). It was called Young Man of Manhattan and starred Claudette Colbert and Norman Foster.</p>
<p>For me, it is notable as it marked the on-screen debut of Ginger Rogers--who at age 18 was playing a rich 16-year old flapper with a Helen Kane/Betty Boop-like voice. It&#39;s actually a rather large role for a newcomer. She plays an important part in t<span class="text_exposed_show">he plot, gets to sing a couple short songs (and this isn&#39;t even a musical), and has a line that apparently became a catch-phrase of that era: &quot;Cigarette me, big boy!&quot; It&#39;s a trip seeing her so early in her career, with a rather different appearance from when she became a huge star four years later, after about twenty more films. </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>This film itself is quite enjoyable, as a drama about the relationship between a talented, ambitious woman reporter (Colbert) and her insecure husband and colleague (Foster). These two were married in real life at the time.</p>
<p><span class=" UFICommentActorAndBody"> <span data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}"><span class="UFICommentBody _1n4g">Ginger is certainly fun to watch in this film, though I do think her character is meant to be somewhat annoying. She plays the one who gets &#39;in the way&#39; of the happy marriage. <br /><br />The sound quality of the print I have is not as good as films I&#39;ve seen from 1933 on. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s because this was so much earlier in sound movie history (3 years was a lot at that time) or because it was a lower budget film or because it needs some restoration work. But it was quite watchable fortunately.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Kitty Foyle. RKO, 1940. This is the film Ginger Rogers won her Academy award for. I&#39;ve put off seeing it longer than I should have, perhaps because it&#39;s a serious drama while I have been mainly focused on comedies and fun musicals.</p>
<p>We finally watched it last week and it&#39;s an excellent movie all-around. Ginger dominates the picture and of course is superb. Her two male leads are also very good--Dennis Morgan and James Craig--neither of whom I&#39;d been familiar with before. I pa<span class="text_exposed_show">rticularly liked Craig and the amusing scenes where he first meets and &quot;dates&quot; Ginger-as-Kitty Foyle, spending the evening playing cards in the cramped apartment she shares with two other women.</span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Ginger&#39;s scene where she describes her expectant child as her &quot;candidate for the year 2000&quot; is haunting.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2022ad392da14200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Kf4" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2022ad392da14200d img-responsive" src="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2022ad392da14200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Kf4" /></a>The only issue I have with the film is that it could have been a bit longer. This is an &quot;epic&quot; storyline that takes place over a number of years and involves plenty of twists and turns. I wouldn&#39;t have minded it being spread out over a longer playing time than its actual 108 minutes. (Of course that&#39;s easy for me to say watching from comfort of my own home with flexibility to shut it off and pick up again the next night.)</p>
<p>This film, as with so many of Ginger&#39;s movies, deserves to be more widely remembered today.</p>

<p>You Said A Mouthful. Warner Bros./First National, 1932.</p>
<p>This is a Joe E. Brown comedy with an early-career Ginger Rogers in a supporting role. It was filmed a few months before 42nd Street, making it the earliest of the 30 films of Ginger&#39;s that we&#39;ve now seen. (There were 11 she made before this one according to the list in the back of her book.)</p>
<p>Brown was a big comedy star in the early &#39;30s. This is the first vehicle of his that we&#39;ve seen. (He had a supporting role in the<span class="text_exposed_show"> 1944 Betty Grable film Pin Up Girl that we saw a few weeks ago.) I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to enjoy his style of physical comedy, but this film was hilarious. It is a quick-paced 70 minutes, making it seem even shorter than it was. </span></p>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>To simplify the amusing, convoluted plot a bit, Brown plays an aqua-phobic non-swimmer impersonating a swimming champion so he can impress the wealthy swimming-groupie character played by Ginger Rogers. Brown&#39;s character has a recently-adopted young black son, played by Allen Hoskins, who turns into Brown&#39;s coach and mentor. An allegedly unsinkable swimming suit also plays a significant role.</p>
<p>Hoskins is most famous as &#39;Farina&#39; from numerous Our Gang shorts in the &#39;20s and early &#39;30s. By this point in his career, he had grown too old for that role and had been released. This was one of his last film appearances.</p>
<p>Ginger&#39;s role as the love interest is relatively modest, but she is always compelling to watch. She disliked her outfits in this film (designed by Orry-Kelly), which I can mostly understand. But the huge hat she wears during the beach scene was quite memorable.</p>
<p>Particularly neat for this former Los Angeles resident was seeing the numerous location shots on Catalina Island.</p>

<p>From my Facebook archives, February 15, 2015:</p>
<p>It Had To Be You. Columbia, 1947. This is a zany romantic comedy film, with an odd, surrealistic plot.</p>
<p>Ginger Rogers&#39; character is a bit looney, but in a very funny and loveable way. She is portraying someone ten years younger than her actual age (26 versus 36), yet her appearance is youthful enough to make that quite plausible. Cornel Wilde, who I was not familiar with before, is appropriately amusing, obnoxious, and charming in his dual role. The supporting characters, which include Spring Byington, all do an excellent job. It&#39;s quite an enjoyable film if you&#39;re in the mood for an over-the-top outrageous goofball comedy. For Ginger Rogers fans, which of course includes me, it is a must-see.</p>
