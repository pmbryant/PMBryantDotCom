<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Over the last few years, I've done a substantial amount of research and writing on Ida Lupino's career. Here is a summary of the articles I've written in that time, ordered roughly chronologically by the time period they are about. </p>

<p>There is clearly a big gap between 1949 and 1963, a period that encompasses many different fascinating periods of Lupino's life—including virtually her entire time as independent producer-director, her transition to acting and producing for television, her successful sitcom, and her transition to television director. There is almost too much in that period to write about! I have tried—and continue to try to finish an article about a small portion of that period.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The articles:</p>
