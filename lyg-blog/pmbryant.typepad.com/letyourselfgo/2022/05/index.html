                                <p>Here is an article, written by Ida Lupino herself during the height of World War 2, about her experiences visiting with wounded veterans. Her husband at the time, Louis Hayward, had returned a few months earlier from his harrowing experience overseas at the Battle of Tarawa in the South Pacific. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202942fabe4dd200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202942fabe4dd200c img-responsive" alt="Your Soldier And Mine, by Ida Lupino, page 1" title="Your Soldier And Mine, by Ida Lupino, page 1" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202942fabe4dd200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>

  <p><strong>Your Soldier and Mine...</strong></p>
  
  <p><em>by Ida Lupino</em></p>
  
  <p>(In <em>Screen Stars, June 1944</em>)</p>
  
  <p><em>It is our proud privilege to present Ida Lupino's own story, written especially for you. This fine actress dwells on a subject closest to her heart -- and yours -- our soldiers. It will awaken you anew to the debt and deep gratitude we owe these wonderful boys.</em></p>
  
  <p>OUR returning men will require an even greater courage to face the problems of eventual peace than the blind disregard of physical danger demanded of them to face the enemy.</p>
  
  <p>Even as we have depended on them, now they must depend on us as civilian individuals to make "home" a decent place to come back to. We civilians have only begun our war. A war to do our share in evening the score for our men when they return as veterans to look for jobsâ€”to resume their part in civilian life.</p>
  
  <p>Our men must never feel that they are neglected outsiders. They must never wonder why, and for what reason, they are carrying an empty sleeve, crutches, or a cane.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e156b49e200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e156b49e200b img-responsive" alt="Your Soldier And Mine, by Ida Lupino, page 2" title="Your Soldier And Mine, by Ida Lupino, page 2" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e156b49e200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every citizen should pledge him or herself to find one job for one ex-serviceman. Suppose there are no jobsâ€”<em>then we must make them</em>. If there are four passengers to be crowded into the back seat of a car which would normally accommodate threeâ€”you crowd overâ€”double up. That's the way it must be with jobs.</p>
  
  <p>There must be no "sorry, come back another day." No weeks of trudging the streets, trying to find some way to re-enter civilian life!</p>
  
  <p>Just visit the hospitals! Talk to our men returning from action overseas. Count the cost for them!</p>
  
  <p>There's a kid whose whole life centered on his ability to lift high tension wires. He took considerable pride in this feat. A neck nerve was severed in battle at Attu. He can't lift with either left or right arm. But he has been re-established in the American way of life. Warner Brothers gave him a job in the mailing department. He is no longer conscious of his disabilities as a permanent insurmountable handicap!</p>
  
  <p>There's the great ace pilot who today wears steel plates in his head from World War I. He has trained hundreds of men for the R.A.F. and also ferried planes until his health cracked. True, he could no longer fly, but he said, "I can do so many other things. I', only 40. I can fit in somewhere. I can do something, if I can get a job."</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For four weeks, he tried unsuccessfully. Some of us took it upon ourselves to see that he found one. We went scouting around and now he's handling actors. He is again in the active scheme of useful civilian life. And he's happy.</p>
  
  <p>Craig Reynolds returned from Guadalcanal wearing a brace from his knee to his foot. Immediately he was given a job by RKO and a good contract. That is the way it should be. Immediate jobs for every veteran.</p>
  
  <p>Each civilian must say, "I personally will see that the guy who needs a jobâ€”gets work." So you go to town and you start contacting people. Come hell or high water you take the individual responsibility. You fight this battleâ€”as only a civilian can.</p>
  
  <p>I may be pretty rabid on this subject, but I have 10,000,000 men who will back me upâ€”and tens of thousands of civilians, too. So it's going to be a little tough to do a job for every soldier. Okay, the war is tough. And battle is tough. And we civilians have been affected the least. Our personal war is this responsibility nowâ€”planning a sound post-war world for our boys. </p>
  
  <p>In the meantime, I wonder if civilians understand that they don't have to belong to organizations, nor wait to be asked by special committees to make good-cheer visits to our wounded who have already returned. No one can realize how much it means until they have talked to these boys. Just a smile, an exchange of wordsâ€”a short chat is
  enough to brighten their day.</p>
  
  <p>I visit the Norco Naval Hospital at Corona, California, regularly. It is here that you find the real casualties from overseas, It would take three months to go through the tremendous hospital at Norco and give individual attention to each patient, but since I have been free from studio work in the past few months I have visited there weeklyâ€”and eventually I hope to be able to say I have met and talked with every man in that hospital.</p>
  
  <p>The great courage and philosophy and sense of humor of these kidsâ€”for so many are just kidsâ€”is inspirational. I have been privileged to meet some of them on a common groundâ€”through kinship with my own experiences. In the skin grafting wards, for instance, the most amazing miracles of medical science and skill are being effected. There was the boy whose plane crashed. A flaming torch, he managed to drag two of his buddies from the burning wreckage. In a few months, he will leave that hospital with a complete new face. There will never be any surface evidence of the untold horror and suffering he has experienced. </p>
  
  <p>It is fascinating to mark the progress of new noses, new chins, new hands and fingers. These boys and I, as I said, have something in common. When I was thirteen I was run over by a speeding automobile. My face was terribly lacerated. My thumb and knee cap we're practically torn off. I couldn't tell you how many times I've told my story to the kids at the hospital. To help encourage themâ€”to point out how, even in the infancy of plastic surgery, my finger and knee cap mended. I still have the slight scars to prove my storyâ€”and the boys who are awaiting their skin grafts and plastic work seem to worry just a little less after we finish talking. Quite justifiably they have the greatest confidence in these surgeons whose results beggar description. They are accomplishing miracles. One has to <em>see</em> them, to believe.</p>
  
  <p>Having fully recovered from an attack of infantile paralysis, I can talk about that, too, with the boys in these wards. We chin by the hour on our "case histories."</p>
  
  <p>I had been visiting at the hospital one day when the C.O. asked me if I'd mind staying to meet some of the new boys. I saw them that nightâ€”the kids coming in direct from the South Pacificâ€”hundreds of them. Those that could walk came in with their duffle bags slung cockily over their shoulders. They walked down the corridor of the hospitalâ€”and past me.</p>
  
  <p>"Holy Smokeâ€”what a paradise!" they ejaculated. Suddenly, someone recognized me. "Gad awmighty, if it isn't Ida Lupino!"</p>
  
  <p>"Say," somebody else sighed, "I think we're going to <em>love</em> this place. It looks like a regular class hotel and here's an actress from Hollywood to greet us." I wouldn't take anything for the privilege of meeting those kids as they came in that night. I don't care how corny I may soundâ€”it hit me, down deep inside.</p>
  
  <p>Since I am a Marine's wife, I think I am entitled to say just a word or two about my own husband, Captain Louis Hayward, even though he is "set" against any kind of publicity for himself. When he came home from the battle of Tarawa, he was scared stiff by the deluge of requests for photographs and interviews.</p>
  
  <p>"I'm through being an actor," he said sincerely, "for the duration. Why should I pose for pictures? Who am I to spout off about my part at Tarawa? I fought beside heroesâ€”and I saw them die. And you can't talk about that." And he didn't.</p>
  
  <p>It was with Louis that I first visited the Tarawa casualties at Norco. I was little Miss Nobody that day. A moving picture actress didn't mean a thing. The boys were polite, but it was "the Captain we want to see. Where is he?"</p>
  
  <p>There was a bad shrapnel case. "Why Cap," the lad grinned through me at Louis, "why not move in? You don"t look so hot?"</p>
  
  <p>Louis smiled back, "Well maybe I will."</p>
  
  <p>I'm glad I was with him that day. It was inexplicableâ€”the exchange of looks between the Captain and these kids. They'd been through it together, and no one except one who had, could crash the understanding they shared.</p>
  
  <p>To get back to the important business of our Civilian War Front. No one can underestimate the responsibility every individual should assume, in doing their part for the boys who have returned. The honorably discharged... the wounded... require everyone's help in erasing the scars of battleâ€”in helping to restore them to a normal life againâ€”to a feeling of security in the freedom of a land that is theirs, and all of ours. When one gets an opportunity to talk to these boys, they tell you enthusiastically about some of Hollywood's own, to whom they are grateful.</p>
  
  <p>Kay Francis is one of the great unsung heroines of this war. Quietly, without fanfare, she spends every other day of her life visiting the hospitals. And the men virtually worship her.</p>
  
  <p>Humphrey Bogart is the tops of all time. He's so tough, and real, and down-to-earth. Louis told me that the men would wait hours in the rain in the South Pacific, to catch even one sequence of a Bogart picture.</p>
  
  <p>And Joe E. Brownâ€”they can't rave enough about him. No island has been too obscure for him to visit. He is likely to turn up anywhereâ€”unheralded. He just arrives with, "well, here I am, boys"â€”and the show is on.</p>
  
  <p>Bob Hope, of course, is tirelessâ€”one of the great civilian heroes of this, or any war. To say the boys worship him would be understating it.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, few of us can even attempt to compete with his socko entertainment for the men. Since this is a fact, most of us have discovered we do better on a program designed so the boys can join in the fun.</p>
  
  <p>Irene Dunne arrived at a camp to sing a few songs and found there was no accompaniest. Thousands of soldiers sat there quietly, waiting to see what she was going to do. </p>
  
  <p>Irene broke down, and broke them down, with the blunt admission, "Hey, fellas, this is new to me. My accompaniest isn't hereâ€”but I can sing a couple of songs if you'll help me out!" A barrage of applause gave their approval. And without accompaniment, Irene started to singâ€”familiar, popular songs everyone knew. Pretty soon everyone was singing with herâ€”and they kept right on singingâ€”for forty-five minutes.</p>
  
  <p>The kids are wonderful! They don't expect you to be an artistâ€”or put on a terrific act. All they wantâ€”and the thing they appreciate mostâ€”is for you to be yourselfâ€”regular! </p>
  
  <p>My sister, Rita, and I, and Lela Anderson dropped in at March Field one morning. We had no show. We'd had no breakfast, and we'd been driving for hours in an open car. We walked across the fieldâ€”it seemed milesâ€”in more wind. The rats and hairpins had long since fallen from our fancy hair-dos. But as far as the boys were concerned, we were positive okay. They were glad to see us. They made us feel like we were queens. We were simply visiting. We had no act, nothing planned. But we walked into one of the wards, and Rita started things with the crack: "Say, boys, six doctors rushed us at the front office. They said, 'Okay, casualties ... what campaigns, please ...' and ordered us to this ward!"</p>
  
  <p>The boys roared. And Rita kept right on cracking. We walked through so many wards, we were limp. The docs finally put us in wheelchairs and tagged us the "Sulpha Sisters"â€”fastest cure they'd ever had in the hospital. By the time we'd completed our "visit" we'd covered 26 acres!</p>
  
  <p>The incredibly high morale of our body who have returned from Attu, from the Marshalls, from the South Pacificâ€”everywhere, is so wonderful that it cannot be described in words. Their great courage, the philosophy they've adopted, their sense of humor is inspirational for all of us. Some of them are expressing themselves in writingâ€”songs, stories, poems. I'd like to conclude by letting you read one of the latter, written by Lieutenant W. D. Del Maestro at Norco Naval Hospital who expresses, far better than I, just how they feel aboutâ€”

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Background: The article here describes events on the set of the movie <em>On Dangerous Ground</em> (1951), starring Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan, and directed by Nicholas Ray. The movie is referred to by its working title, <em>Mad With Much Heart</em>. </p>

<p>Just before starting her work in this movie, Lupino had completed producing and directing her third independent production, <em>Outrage</em>. As we will see, even while acting, Lupino had her mind on her future productions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Los Angeles Daily News, May 8, 1950</em></strong></p>
  
  <p><em>by Darr Smith</em><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1555679200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1555679200b img-responsive" alt="Darr Smith article in Los Angeles Daily News for May 8, 1950" title="Darr Smith article in Los Angeles Daily News for May 8, 1950" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1555679200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>
  
  <p>On the set of RKO's picture, "Mad With Much Heart," there are two directorsâ€”one active, one inactive. Nick Ray, tall, quiet and toothy, is the active one, while Actress Ida Lupino is inactiveâ€”at least as far as directing the picture is concerned. As an actress in it, she is anything but inactive.</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino has her own picture producing organization called The Filmakers, and, as most people know, she has been functioning as the director of its product.</p>
  
  <p>In "Mad With Much Heart" she has been intently observing the technique of Ray, who just happens to be one of the best directors in the directing dodge.</p>
  
  <p>One morning last week after a difficult scene, Miss Lupino, a slim-hipped wench who speaks in what might be called a whisky baritone and who acts as though she had at least two built-in furnaces, threw her arms around Ray's neck and said:</p>
  
  <p>"Oh, darling! You're wonderful!"</p>
  
  <p><strong>The fan</strong></p>
  
  <p>Then she backed away from him and said: "If we're going to make love, let's get over in front of that fan."</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino turned to us and added, "He's wonderful, but he's also a bum. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to expose him.</p>
  
  <p>"He read the script for Filmakers' next picture-which just happens to be called 'The Lowdown' and said that there was one part in it he'd like to play.</p>
  
  <p>"And he was so right! It is perfect for himâ€”a guy who's tall, suave and bad. So every time we thought of the part we thought of Nick Ray. Then we started to do some rewrites on the script and we did them thinking of this lug.</p>
  
  <p>"Now the part is tailored to him and he's being coy. He won't say yes or no. His agent says Nick will cost a lot of money as an actor. I say he won't because even though his salary is established as a director, it's not established as an actor. I say we should get him for peanuts because of all the trouble he's already cost us."</p>
  
  <p>Nick Ray broke in with: "When do you start?"</p>
  
  <p>"You know very well when we start, but you've said you'd be cutting this picture then. Besides, I don't know whether I want to direct you as an actor. You'd probably sit back and think, 'There she goes, lousing it up again!'"</p>
  
  <p>"No," said Nick, "I'd probably be thinking, 'What a great actress she is!'"</p>
  
  <p>From Miss Lupino: "Drop dead!"</p>
  
  <p><strong>New shot</strong></p>
  
  <p>An assistant director saved anybody from doing anything violent by announcing that everything was ready for the next shot. They all trooped off to accomplish it.</p>
  
  <p>The fun was over and the serious work was at hand. </p>
  
  <p>Ray, a quiet man, as we have said, practically whispers directions to his actors. He took co-star Robert Ryan aside and solemnly whispered in his ear. Ryan nodded. Then Ray went to Miss Lupino and whispered to her. She nodded; Ray moved back behind the camera, and the scene was shot.</p>
  
  <p>They did it again. More whispering. Miss Lupino took more preparation, and it was done. </p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino threw her arms around Ray's neck again and said, "Darling, how about it? Will you play the part?"</p>
  
  <p>Ray said, "Let's move over in front of the fan where I can think."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Post-script: <em>The Lowdown</em>, after multiple re-writes over several years, eventually became <em>Private Hell 36</em> (1954)â€”one of the last films produced by The Filmakers. Lupino did not direct it, but starred in it with Steve Cochran and then-husband Howard Duff. Nicholas Ray did not play a part in that film.</p>

To celebrate the memory of dear departed classic film champion and <a href="https://www.caftanwoman.com/">blogger</a> Patricia Nolan-Hall, for <a href="https://www.ladyevesreellife.com/2022/05/the-caftan-woman-blogathon.html">"The Caftan Woman Blogathon"</a>, I am covering a time in the life and career of Ida Lupino that Paddy had touched upon in her writing a few years ago. </p>

<p>Paddy contributed an article to the collection of essays <a href="https://medium.com/cinesuffragette/the-ida-lupino-files-76530b1d243c"><em>The Ida Lupino Files</em></a> entitled <em>Ida Lupino Directs The Fugitive And Creates Classic Television</em>. Lupino directed three episodes of that television show, all in its first seasonâ€”1963-'64. In her essay, Paddy summarizes these episodes for those of us not familiar with them. My essay will cover events in Lupino's life in the months prior to and after working on <em>The Fugitive</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>At the time Lupino directed <em>The Fugitive</em>, she was in her mid-40s and at the height of the television-directing episode of her career.  Television director was one of several incarnations Lupino went through during her nearly five decade in show business, including roles as actress, composer, writer, producer, and motion picture director. Over three decades earlier, Lupino had begun her film career in her native England at the age of fourteen, with lead roles in six films. Within a year, she was discovered by Hollywood, signed to a multi-year contract and moved across the Atlantic. Her acting career had ups and downs in the 1930s, but by the early 1940s she had become a big name thanks to her roles in films like <em>The Light That Failed</em>, <em>They Drive By Night</em>, and <em>High Sierra</em>. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://www.ladyevesreellife.com/2022/05/the-caftan-woman-blogathon.html"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e154187f200b img-responsive" alt="Caftan Woman Blogathon 2022" title="Caftan Woman Blogathon 2022" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e154187f200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>For the next decade, she was a full-fledged movie star. Yet, as reporter Peter Bart described her later, she "was a movie star who hated stardom, a glamour queen who loathed glamour". Near the end of the 1940s, Lupino decided to shift away from acting towards the work she found more interesting. She started her own production company in partnership with then-husband Collier Young. She co-wrote and co-produced several successful low-budget picturesâ€”and became the only woman director in Hollywood at the time.</p>

<p>By 1954, the popularity of television was revolutionizing the film industry. Lupino's company, <em>The Filmakers</em>, was a victim of the changing times. She then moved into television acting and writing, with occasional film roles added in. By the late 1950s, she and new husband Howard Duff had created a sitcom that they starred in, <em>Mr. Adams and Eve</em>, which had a brief run of popularity. The show was cancelled in 1958 after two seasons, and Lupino, now 40, decided again to move behind the scenes. She started directing television shows in late 1958 with <em>Have Gun, Will Travel</em> and soon became in-demand. She virtually gave up actingâ€”aside from infrequent guest appearances on television.</p>

<p><strong>1963-1964</strong></p>

<p>This brings us to the year when Lupino became involved with <em>The Fugitive</em>, nearly five years into her television directing career.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1541943200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1541943200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino with Gary Clarke on The Virginian episode 'A Distant Fury', 1963" title="Ida Lupino with Gary Clarke on The Virginian episode 'A Distant Fury', 1963" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1541943200b-250wi" /></a>Lupino began 1963 with work as both actor and director on <em>Sam Benedict</em>, a detective show starring Edmond O'Brien. O'Brien had worked with Lupino in her days as a movie producer-director, starring in two of her films a decade earlierâ€”<em>The Hitch-Hiker</em> and <em>The Bigamist</em>. Now, Lupino acted with him on his television show as a guest star, and directed two other episodes. Also in the early months of 1963, Lupino directed two episodes of <em>The Untouchables</em>, plus appeared as a guest star on an episode of <em>The Virginian</em>. </p>

<p>Both of Lupino's guest acting appearances in early 1963 were alongside her husband, Howard Duff, who she frequently tried to work with. She and Duff had been married in late 1951 immediately after Lupino had obtained a divorce from Collier Young. Lupino gave birth to their daughter in the spring of 1952. By the next year, the Lupino-Duff marriage was in troubleâ€”very public trouble. They had several prolonged separations that were much discussed in the press. With each one, divorce seemed more likely. Yet each time they reconciledâ€”to the amazement of their friends.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278807b8705200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20278807b8705200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino with daughter Bridget and husband Howard Duff in 1955, during filming of the film 'While the City Sleeps'" title="Ida Lupino with daughter Bridget and husband Howard Duff in 1955, during filming of the film 'While the City Sleeps'" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278807b8705200d-250wi" /></a>By 1955, with their tempestuous relationship inspiring the theme of the sitcom they were then developing, the Lupino-Duff marriage appears to have stabilized. But once <em>Mr. Adams and Eve</em> was in the past, their troubles occasionally returned. The 1963-'64 period appears to have been relatively calm, as there were no indications in the press of any personal troubles between them, and the two appeared together on television frequently. For instance, aside from their acting appearances mentioned above, they were both guests of new host Johnny Carson on the <em>Tonight Show</em> in May, 1963.  </p>

<p>Lupino and Duff also were business partners, with Lupino trying to replicate the success she had had as an independent producer with Collier Young and <em>The Filmakers</em> from 1949 to 1954. In late 1961, she and Duff formed Stanley Productionsâ€”named after her late fatherâ€”to produce a thriller they had purchased entitled <em>The Plotters</em>. By May, 1963, this project was still in development, but clearly Lupino was pushing hard. An article in the Philadelphia Daily News quotes her:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My husband and I are now planning to make some films in the next couple of years. 
  We are highly encouraged by the fact that the money men and producers seem to want to keep production here in the United States and are willing to put up money for low-budget pictures.</p>
  
  <p>The story is the thing.
  About a year ago we bought a couple of books, including one called "The Plotters", which we hope to get into production next month. </p>
  
  <p>Our company is a combination of a friend of ours named Fred Hamilton, who used to be a production executive at NBC, my husband, and me. 
  They are the president and vice-president, in reverse order, and Iâ€™m treasurer.
  We call the company Stanley Productions, after my father. 
  Iâ€™ll direct some of these pictures... but Iâ€™ll keep a hand in all the rest of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The setup that Lupino sketches here sounds virtually identical to that for <em>The Filmakers</em> from a decade prior. With her earlier company, Lupino similarly had two business partnersâ€”with one her husbandâ€”plus she directed some films and kept a hand in "all the rest".</p>

<p>At this same time, Louella Parsons wrote that Lupino and Duff aimed to launch a "full-scale production program of two movie scripts and three TV pilots", while simultaneously writing a children's book.</p>

<p>Alas, while Lupino discussed Stanley Productions into at least 1966 and pursued similar projects well into the 1970s, no new productions by Lupino ever materialized. It's not clear from the public record why her aim to again independently produce and direct films was stymied. Perhaps a hint is that, a few years later, Lupino wrote an essay (<em>Me, Mother Directress</em>) where she mentioned having turned down good opportunities to direct films because they would have to be produced overseas and she did not want to spend months away from her husband and daughter.</p>

<p>So with Stanley Productions unable to move forward, Lupino maintained her directing career with work in television. In late April, 1963, shortly before her <em>Tonight Show</em> appearance, Lupino signed to direct several episodes of the new series <em>The Fugitive</em> that would air on ABC-TV in the fall. Also for the 1963-'64 season, she signed to direct episodes of <em>Mr. Novak</em>, <em>The Breaking Point</em>, <em>Dr. Kildare</em>, <em>Kraft Suspense Theater</em>, and <em>The Twilight Zone</em>. This last one, where she directed the episode titled <em>The Masks</em>, is one of her most often cited and most well-regarded directorial efforts today. She also continued her writing, and, in collaboration with her younger cousin, Richard Lupino, sold a script to Alfred Hitchcock for his television show.</p>

<p>In addition to her busy directorial schedule and behind-the-scenes efforts on Stanley Productions, Lupino continued to dabble in acting, despite some possible insecurities about aging. Columnist Sidney Skolsky quoted her in August: "Iâ€™ve never gone through that frightening period of having been a glamor girl. To be a glamor girl and then lose your looks must mean a painful emotional transition."</p>

<p>Lupino was one of several celebrity guest stars, including husband Duff, who had small roles in an episode of <em>Burke's Law</em> aired on November 8, 1963. And she had a co-starring role in an episode of Kraft Suspense Theater, <em>One Step Down</em>, with Gena Rowlands and Leslie Nielsen, that aired the next week. </p>

A few days after that, November 19, the first of the episodes she directed for <em>The Fugitive</em> airedâ€”<em>Fatso</em>. Two weeks later, with President Kennedy's assassination happening in the interim, her second directed episode of <em>The Fugitive</em> was shownâ€”<em>Glass Tightrope</em>. Six weeks after that, her third and final one, <em>The Garden House</em>, aired on January 14, 1964.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202942fa94124200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202942fa94124200c img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="The Twilight Zone, The Masks, 1964" title="The Twilight Zone, The Masks, 1964" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202942fa94124200c-250wi" /></a>Lupino's now most famous television directing effortâ€”<em>The Masks</em> for <em>The Twilight Zone</em>â€”aired on March 30 to virtually no press notice. While that episode receives a lot of attention today, Lupino herself appears to have thought her work that season on <em>The Fugitive</em> and <em>Mr. Novak</em> was most worthy of recognition. The New York Daily News reported in September, 1963 that her ambition was to win an Emmy award for either of those shows.  Furthermore, in an interview a decade later (published in <em>People Will Talk</em> by John Kobal), Lupino mentioned her work on <em>The Fugitive</em>, <em>Mr. Novak</em> and <em>The Untouchables</em> as work she especially enjoyed. </p>

<p>An anecdote published in July 1964, said that Lupino "will go to any lengths to get the effect she wants. She was directing a show that called for a breath-taking drive down a steep mountain road. With a stuntman doing the driving, Ida climbed into the back seat with a cameraman and gave running directions to both men during the hazardous drive. The brass at the studio, which objected strenuously to Ida's taking such an active part, breathed a sigh of relief when everyone came out unscathed."</p>

<p>After November, 1963, Lupino had no further acting appearance on television that season. But she did appear with her husband on the evening premiere of the game show <em>You Don't Say</em> on Jan. 7, 1964. She and Duff also appeared on another game show the next July called <em>The Celebrity Game</em>.</p>

<p>As the 1964-'65 television season opened, Lupino's work on <em>The Fugitive</em> was in the pastâ€”but new projects beckoned. She acted and directed on <em>The Rogues</em>, a well-received comedy caper show starring Lupino's old acting colleagues David Niven, Charles Boyer and Gig Young and produced by her ex-husband Collier Young. She directed some comedy shows with <em>Gilligan's Island</em> and <em>Bewitched</em>â€”and more.</p>

<p>But the biggest project, finally getting underway early in 1965, was to become the first feature film she had directed in over a decade, plus her first and only feature film that she directed for a major studioâ€”the movie initially known as <em>Mother Superior</em> and later released as <em>The Trouble With Angels</em>, starring Rosalind Russell and Haley Mills. That, of course, marked the beginning of yet another episode in Ida Lupino's storied career and is a tale for another day.</p>
