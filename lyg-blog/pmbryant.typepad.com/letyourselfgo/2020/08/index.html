Its stars are now virtually forgotten. Ida Lupino, the third lead, is well-remembered—though primarily for her post-1940 acting career and as a groundbreaking woman director in Hollywood. Her stint at Paramount in the 1930s is neglected.</p>

<p>The story of the production of <em>Paris in Spring</em> begins in late 1934 as the teenage Ida Lupino was on a several-month vacation in her native London, taking time-off after an eventful first year in Hollywood. In November 1934, Paramount purchased an unproduced stage play called <em>Two on a Tower</em> as the second film vehicle for opera singer and actress Mary Ellis, who they were attempting to build into a movie star. </p>

<p>With Ellis in <em>Two on a Tower</em>, the studio aimed to replicate  Columbia's success with opera singer Grace Moore in <em>One Night of Love</em> (1934). Lewis Milestone (<em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> 1930, <em>The Front Page</em> 1931) was soon brought in as director. <em>Two on a Tower</em> was planned to be one of the studio's more prominent productions of 1935. </p>

<p>Initially, early-career Cary Grant was considered for the male lead. But Paramount decided to go in a different direction. Shortly after the year began, they signed Tullio Carminati for that role. He had starred opposite Grace Moore in <em>One Night of Love</em>, so this was another building block in replicating that success. Carminati understood he was a key part, as he held out for "plenty of money". Dorothy Parker was brought in to help write dialogue and lyrics for the film. (She did not end up in the final credits.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be40d102e200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be40d102e200d img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino, glamour shot on set of Paris in Spring" title="Ida Lupino, glamour shot on set of Paris in Spring" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be40d102e200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>At this point Ida Lupino, Paramount's young ingenue star from England, enters the story.  She was cast as the second female lead behind Ellis and Carminati. Her first three roles in Hollywood had all been leads, but those were less prestigious productions.</p>

<p>Ida was very young—she would turn 17 in early February. A veteran of prominent roles in several British films, she had signed with Paramount in the summer of 1933 and moved to Hollywood with her mother Connie. She was the most talked-about candidate in the highly-publicized search for the role of Alice in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. Ida did not get the part, but the studio nonetheless decided to promote the young actress as an up-and-coming star. They cast her in leading roles in three films released in 1934.  Over the summer, Ida had a few scary weeks recovering from an attack of infantile paralysis—polio. The studio delayed production of her next film until she recovered. After that, Ida decided to take time off to visit her father and sister in England. The studio agreed to let her take a leave for a few months.</p>

<p>In mid-January 1935, Ida arrived back in the United States aboard the Olympic with her mother and younger sister Rita, with the press reporting that she would be starting work on <em>Two on a Tower</em> immediately on her arrival in Hollywood a few days later. When she did get back to Hollywood, she was widely reported saying, "Four months abroad impressed me with the fact that I am first a Southern Californian and second an English woman," and expressing a desire for American citizenship.</p>

<p>By late January, work on the picture was underway. New York Daily News columnist Sidney Skolsky visited the set and reported that Ida looked more beautiful than before her trip to England, was as excited as a movie fan to meet Mary Ellis, and somehow had lost her heavy English accent. Ida, already well-known for playing bad-girl roles, said, "It's funny, me getting such a goody, goody role." She also said, "I fell in love, really in love for the first time, while I was in London... And now I'm to get a chance to prove I'm an actress."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bde8e4535200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bde8e4535200c img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino and Tullio Carminati in the opening scene from Paris in Spring" title="Ida Lupino and Tullio Carminati in the opening scene from Paris in Spring" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bde8e4535200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The film was a musical comedy with several operetta-style songs—all sung by Mary Ellis, though Carminati chimes in with a few verses in one of them. The original name of <em>Two on a Tower</em> came from the opening scene, where Carminati rides to the top of the Eiffel Tower feigning a desire to leap off of it, as Ellis' character has rebuffed his marriage proposals. At the top, Carminati encounters Ida Lupino's character, who appears to be more seriously attempting the same thing. Their encounter is about as charming as a double-suicide meet-cute can be. Their suicide plans are called off in an embrace, and they commence scheming to win back their true loves. For me, this charming scene is the highlight of the movie. </p>

<p>Soon, the name <em>Two on a Tower</em> had been dropped in favor of the more generic, but presumably more salable, <em>Paris in Spring</em>. The elaborate sets used in the film for the nightclub and the massive French country house indicate that Paramount was not skimping on this production. Press reports said the set was one of the largest at the studio. An item in <em>Variety</em> in June said that of recent Paramount pictures, <em>Paris in Spring</em> had the highest production cost—$800,000.</p>

<p>Rumors of a potential romance between Ida and director Lewis Milestone hit the papers in February—they were seen together many nights at various night spots. Both denied anything more than friendship. Ida was reportedly also dating actor Richard Cromwell. On March 9, Louella Parsons published an item: "Cary Grant, the object of many women's attention, beauing Ida Lupino." </p>

<p>Ida's January comments about becoming more Californian than English must have caused a stir in her native country, as in March, she was doing damage control: "[Ida Lupino] feels extremely grateful for the opportunities afforded her in this country but would consider renouncing her rights as an Englishwoman in the same way most people would think of desertion from the army."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e960f5a0200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e960f5a0200b img-responsive" alt="Mary Ellis, promotional shot for Paris in Spring" title="Mary Ellis, promotional shot for Paris in Spring" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e960f5a0200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Shooting on <em>Paris in Spring</em> was completed in the last week of March. All three leads came through with gifts for the crew, which was unusual enough to merit press attention. Mary Ellis then sailed for England to appear in a play, planning to return to Paramount late in the year for another musical. Carminati gave Ida a small watch for "being a good little girl".</p>

<p>Around this same time, Ida started spending time with the famous  millionaire, film producer, and aviator, Howard Hughes. In early April, they were photographed in Palm Springs together, and by mid-April, Ida had to issue a denial of impending marriage: "We are very, very, VERY good friends, but that is all." Her dates with Hughes, all chaperoned by her mother according to Ida's later recollections, appear to have ceased not long after.</p>

<p>In early May, Ida was invited by Jackie Coogan, the child star of Charlie Chaplin's <em>The Kid</em> on a weekend outing but declined. The trip resulted in a horrendous automobile accident that killed four people in the car, including teenage actor Trent "Junior" Durkin, and severely injured Coogan, the only survivor.</p>

<p>After this tragedy, she was back working in her next pictures at Paramount: <em>Peter Ibbetson</em>, another supporting role in a prestigious production—this one starring Gary Cooper and Ann Harding; and <em>Smart Girl</em>, a comic-drama programmer where she was the lead.</p>

<p>The first public preview of <em>Paris in Spring</em> was held in San Bernardino on May 20. Ida and Lewis Milestone attended along with numerous other representatives from Paramount; Carminati and Ellis are not mentioned. (Of course Ellis was in England by this point.) The official release of the film was a week later, and it generally received favorable, though lukewarm, reviews. </p>

<p>The vast majority of reviewers' attention, almost all quite positive, was focused on Mary Ellis. Ida Lupino was not mentioned in depth by many. One reviewer for the New York Daily News, after a glowing discussion of Ellis, wrote: "Ida Lupino, who has obviously been to a new beauty parlor as well as to a new school of dramatics, where in the first she has acquired a superior pulchritude and in the second a bigger and better acting sense." A Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote that "It is Ida Lupino who offers the surprise performance, however. She plays with humor and charm and projects personality for the first time." (This seems overly harsh on Ida's earlier performances, especially in <em>Ready for Love</em> (1934) and her British films of 1933.) Modern Screen magazine wrote about the supporting players, "The lad [James Blakeley] can act. So can Ida Lupino." They added, "Ida Lupino's about as interesting a movie starlet as you'll find out there."</p>

<p>At the box office, the appeal of <em>Paris in Spring</em> appears to have been limited, though I haven't found any concrete evidence of how it performed. Despite the mixed-to-positive reviews, a handful of exhibitor comments in the <em>Motion Picture Herald</em> in the second half of 1935 are mostly negative. One of the harsher ones said, "Many of our patrons decided they did not care to visit 'Paris in Spring'". The film had started its descent into obscurity.</p>

<p>As for the players, Mary Ellis returned to Paramount later in 1935 and did only one more film there, <em>Fatal Lady</em> (1936). She continued her long career on the London stage afterwards. She lived to the age of 105, dying in 2003. Her autobiography, <em>Those Dancing Years</em>, was published in 1982. In the book, she refers to <em>Paris in Spring</em> as <em>Paris Love Song</em>, and says "working in it was one of the most enjoyable times I ever had".</p>

<p>Tullio Carminati did a substantial number of films in Europe over the rest his career. His subsequent Hollywood film appearances after <em>Paris in Spring</em> were rare, but he did have a supporting role in the well-known romantic comedy <em>Roman Holiday</em> in 1953.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino continued at Paramount for a few more years—growing  increasingly unsatisfied with the types of roles she was getting—before abruptly leaving the studio in late 1937. After a career crisis, she broke into stardom at Warner Bros. in 1940, spending most of the next decade as an acting star before transitioning to writing, producing, and directing films—and later television. </p>

<p>In Ida Lupino's brief memoir, edited and published posthumously by Mary Ann Anderson, there is no mention of <em>Paris in Spring</em>.</p>

This brief review is my contribution to the Classic Film Reading Challenge, run by Raquel Stecher of the<a href="http://www.outofthepastblog.com/"> Out of the Past</a> blog. (I originally posted a variant of this on Goodreads.)</p>
<p>This is an invaluable window into the life and times of a fascinating, but very troubled, man. The writing is excellent, if a bit scattershot. But that’s Levant&#39;s style, and his acerbic yet hilarious personality shines through. To get the most out of this book, it helps to have a passing familiarity with or interest in the Hollywood and classical music scene of the 1920s-1950s, and perhaps the television scene of the 1960s. If you do have any interest in those scenes, read this book!</p>

This brief review is my contribution to the Classic Film Reading Challenge, run by Raquel Stecher of the <a href="http://www.outofthepastblog.com/"><em>Out of the Past</em></a> blog. (I originally posted a variant of this on Goodreads.)</p>

<p>I started reading the Kindle book but switched to the audiobook after a couple chapters. This is extremely well researched and well-written. In fact, I think it is an essential book for anyone interested in the golden age of Hollywood. The Hollywood connection stretches from Herman's beginning as a writer in the 1920s to the end of Joe's career as producer-writer-director in the 1970s.</p>

<p>Both of the brothers, Herman and Joe Mankiewicz, come across as pompous asses, but they are fascinating and important characters. Joe’s patronizing and disrespectful attitude toward the women in his profession is an indication of how tough women had it in Hollywood at the time (and still, no doubt). This is especially true since I get the impression that, as bad as he was, Joe may have been one of the better of the Hollywood power players on that front.</p>

<p>The chapter on <em>Cleopatra</em> is fascinating all by itself, and the humbled Joe that emerged from that experience was a more appealing version of his character.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b img-responsive" alt="Bogart.SperberLax.Cover" title="Bogart.SperberLax.Cover" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>A few weeks ago I started reading my first biography of Humphrey Bogart. This book was written by Ann Sperber and Eric Lax, published in the late '90s, and appears to be very thoroughly researched—especially regarding anything that happened at Warner Bros. So I was curious if they mentioned anything about the dog in <em>High Sierra</em> and his relationship to Bogart.</p>

<p>Given my <a href="../05/pard-the-dog-frm-high-sierra-was-it-really-bogarts-dog.html">earlier research</a> that uncovered that Zero, the dog that played Pard, was not owned by Bogart at the time of filming <em>High Sierra</em>, I was not expecting to find anything in this thoroughly-documented biography. But, in fact, there actually is a mention of Zero in this book, and he is specified as Bogart's dog! </p>

<p>This was troubling to me. My research, based on contemporary newspaper articles, seemed highly unlikely to be outright incorrect. So I quickly turned to the end notes to try to find out the source for this brief mention.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="display: inline;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d img-responsive" alt="ZeroBogartFootnote.SperberLax" title="ZeroBogartFootnote.SperberLax" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d-500wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Ida Lupino!</p>

<p>That was certainly a surprise. She said this in a 1991 interview with author Ann Sperber, over 50 years after the filming of the movie. Given the time that had passed, and the lack of corroboration from sources of 1941, it seems clear this is a case of Lupino misremembering. </p>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="../05/pard-the-dog-from-high-sierra-was-it-really-bogarts-dog.html">earlier post</a>, a newspaper story from 1941 had reported, second-hand, that Bogart sought (unsuccessfully) to purchase Zero the dog after the movie. If I may speculate, maybe that was true, maybe Bogart talked during the filming about a desire to own Zero, and maybe, over many decades, that became, in Lupino's mind, that Bogart actually owned Zero.</p>

<p>Due to the solid reputation of the Sperber-Lax biography of Bogart, could it be the original source of all the rumors about Bogart's ownership of Zero that have been repeated so often in internet writings and other sources over the last decade or so? I am inclined to believe so for the time being—pending further discoveries, of course.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Recently a wonderful, if brief, 1972 interview with Ida Lupino was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SF53ECpj1k">posted on YouTube</a>. This interview was part of the publicity surrounding the release of the film <em>Junior Bonner</em>. </p>

<p>The video is from the archives of a long-time television reporter named Bobbie Wygant. The sound quality drops in two or three places for a few seconds, but is mostly decipherable in those places with some effort. So I took the time to transcribe it for posterity and to save others the effort of trying to interpret the words in the tough spots.</p>

<p>Television interviews of Lupino are extremely hard to find these days. In fact, other than the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UgbgrLve7A&amp;t=16s">1958 <em>This is Your Life</em></a> episode, this is the only non-scripted television appearance of Lupino's that I've seen. So this is a real treasure!</p>

<p>Here is the transcript.</p>

<p>--</p>

<p><strong>Bobbie Wygant</strong>: As I said in the introduction, Miss Ida Lupino is returning to the motion picture screen after a 17-year absence. So Miss Lupino, it just has to be the first question—what was it about this role of Elvira that tempted you back to the screen?</p>

<p><strong>Ida Lupino</strong>: Well first of all my agents said, ‘We want to send a script over to you. Mr. Joe Wizan is producing it. Mr Sam Peckinpah is directing it. Steve McQueen and Robert Preston are starring in it and would you like to play Steve McQueen’s mother?’ And without reading the script, I said, ‘I’ll play his grandmother!’  (Laughter) With that lineup—most definitely.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Well I’ve seen the picture and you’d have to have lots and lots of makeup to play his grandmother. I can tell you that.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Well I wouldn’t say that. You’re very kind.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: No, I’ve seen the picture. Now, the other thing that I would like to know is that -- the first day you went back on the set, were you at all nervous about it, Miss Lupino?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Oh yes, very, very. I think when you’ve been back of the camera for a long time and you haven’t made a motion picture for so long, there’s that natural nervousness, you know—your first day and… first couple of days.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: What were you shooting that first day on the set?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Well, actually, I was very lucky. It was the rodeo stuff. (Laughs) And I didn’t do much except stand in crowds and wave to my husband Robert Preston, who plays Ace Bonner. And who is marvelous in it.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: I’ll drink to that. He is, indeed.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: [?] I didn’t say that.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: You’ve been directing and writing for some 17 years now. When you first wanted to be a director, was it a difficult thing to convince people that you could and to give you a chance?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Well, actually I never wanted to be a director. It was just an accident. I had co-written a screenplay for a picture called ‘Not Wanted’ and was co-producing it. And our director unfortunately had a heart attack suddenly. But it had to be made for 125 thousand dollars in ten days. And we couldn’t afford another director. So I took over. Fortunately for us the picture was a success. I said, well that’s fine. I’ll go home and write some lyrics and music—which I like to do! And… but the moneymen said no, I had to direct the second one. And then it was like a snowball and you know, it kept on. And then Howard Hughes took over our company, and he insisted I direct the first three with RKO. And that’s how this ugly thing happened of me getting in back of the camera.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: But when you took over, Miss Lupino, that is really an about-face for an actress, isn’t it? You’ve been in front of the camera, but then it’s a whole ‘nother world in back of the camera, isn’t it?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Yes, a whole ‘nother world. A very good world, though. There’s a lot of nice people.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: It wasn’t a difficult adjustment for you?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Yes, I was terrified. Absolutely terrified. I was never off the phone with our editor saying ‘Have I got him coming in the room in the right direction? Is she looking in the right direction?’ I was like a bird trying, you know, trying to fly for the first time—</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Did you make any goofs?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: I made so many, I can’t even enumerate. (Laughs) But you mean on the first picture?</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Oh yeah I was always calling him up and saying, ‘You know I think I’ve reversed myself here.’ And he’d say, ‘Yes you have’. So I’d have to quickly shoot it over again.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: I’m sure you’re not the first director that’s done that––</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: You know, directions in camera––</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Yes. Now. You surely… Of all the motion pictures you’ve made, Miss Lupino, there are some that you would probably like to be remembered for more than others. Which are the ones you’d most like to be remembered for?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: You mean as an actress or director?</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: As an actress, uhuh, as an actress.</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: There are so many I want to forget. (Laughter)</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Do you care to name any of those? (Laughs)</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: Nooo, I’d rather not. I’d rather not.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Then the ones you’d really like to be remembered for—which ones?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: As a performer, well there’s only one I really cared enough about—that I thought I was half-way decent in, and that was a thing called “Ladies in Retirement”.  It was a New York stage play and I did —(?)—. And I thought I gave a fairly decent performance. And I didn’t shudder when I saw myself—for a change! (Laughs)</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Who were the other people in that?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: It was Elsa Lanchester. And Edith Barrett. Louis Hayward. Evelyn Keyes. And me playing the murderess.</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Miss Lupino, I know you have to go now and dress for the new world premiere tonight—. I do thank you for taking the time to talk with us. And please, don’t stay away for another 17 years, will you?</p>

<p><strong>IL</strong>: No, I won’t. If Mr Wizar will have me back playing a grandmother or an aunt, I’d be delighted! (Laughs)</p>

<p><strong>BW</strong>: Thank you very much, Miss Ida Lupino.</p>
