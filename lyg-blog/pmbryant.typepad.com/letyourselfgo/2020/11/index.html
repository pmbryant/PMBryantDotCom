                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" hrefDISABLED="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d7a200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d7a200d img-responsive" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Moontide poster" title="Moontide poster" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d7a200d-200wi" /></a>The movie <em>Moontide</em> (1942) was one of the earliest of Ida Lupino's films that I watched, nearly four years ago. I found it while looking to discover "noir" films, due to its presence in a DVD collection of 20th Century-Fox noir films. </p>

<p><em>Moontide</em> may not be classic noir in its storyline, but it certainly has exceptional noir cinematography. It left a big impression on me—for its touching romance, its tremendous performances, and its unique and memorable atmospherics—dark and claustrophobic despite its mostly-outdoors setting on a foggy bait barge in Los Angeles harbor. </p>

<p><em>Moontide</em> is also notable for being the first of only two American films made by the legendary French film star Jean Gabin.</p>

<p>This is part of a series of posts on the making of that film.</p>

<p><strong>Origins: The novel</strong></p>

<p>The story of <em>Moontide</em> begins with the prolific character actor Willard Robertson. Born in 1886, Robertson began his career as a lawyer, but with a strong interest in writing and acting that led him to switch careers. In the early 1920s, two of his plays were adapted into films. Around 1930, another writing gig brought him out to Hollywood, where, initially out of curiosity, he fell into character acting in small roles. By 1940, a reporter encapsulated Robertson's feelings as, "He has been typed so hard, there is not much pleasure in making pictures, and his only interests are boats, deep-sea fishing and books."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" hrefDISABLED="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d88200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d88200d img-responsive" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Willard Robertson in 1933" title="Willard Robertson in 1933" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d88200d-200wi" /></a>In the spring of 1940, Robertson was cast as a Mormon elder in the big budget 20th Century-Fox epic <em>Brigham Young</em>, starring Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell and Dean Jagger. The company spent many weeks on location in Utah, the Sierra-Nevada and other locales. Robertson said the only thing to do at nights was to play poker, and he did not like poker. So he retired to his cabin and wrote a novel—his first. That novel became <em>Moon Tide</em>, published in late August 1940, around the time that <em>Brigham Young</em> premiered.</p>

<p>The novel <em>Moon Tide</em> attracted a lot of attention before it was even published. In mid-August, <em>Variety</em> reported that "virtually all major film companies" were interested in the screen rights and that story editors compared the writing to that of John Steinbeck. Reviews of the book published over the next few months were almost uniformly positive. A reviewer in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat wrote, "It is a moving and ironic tale, told with tenderness and commendable restraint." The Chicago Tribune said that the novel "indicates definitely that writing is [Robertson's] natural field."  </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" hrefDISABLED="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea73a14200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea73a14200c img-responsive" style="width: 145px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Moon Tide novel" title="Moon Tide novel" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea73a14200c-150wi" /></a>A few weeks after the novel's publication, <em>Variety</em> reported that the price for the screen rights had been placed at $25,000, and at some point over the next few months, 20th Century-Fox closed the deal for $30,000. (That is equivalent to well-over half a million dollars in 2020.) Robertson must have been thinking of a screen adaptation early on, as he later said that he had written in a good part for himself. That role, however, would eventually be played by Claude Rains.</p>

<p>After selling his novel, Robertson continued his character acting career. He also found the time to write at least two more novels—"South from Yesterday", published in 1943, and "Oasis", published in 1944. I don't believe either were adapted into films, though 20th Century-Fox appears to have been interested in the former in its early stages, according to a December 1941 item by Oakland Tribune columist Wood Soanes.</p>

<p>On April 5, 1948, Robertson died suddenly in Hollywood at the age of 62. One of his last of his 144 film credits was in the Warner Bros. drama "Deep Valley" (1947), starring Ida Lupino.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The role of the viciously ambitious older sister in <em>The Hard Way</em> (1943) could be considered the pinnacle of Ida Lupino's career as a Hollywood movie star. It is the role for which she received her most prestigious award—Best Actress from the New York Film Critics Circle in 1943.</p>

<p>It is commonly cited that Lupino was given this role after Bette Davis had turned it down. The late film historian and television personality Robert Osborne quotes Davis later expressing regret for that decision: "How did I let that one get away?"</p>

<p>It turns out, though, that Warner Bros. intended <em>The Hard Way</em> to be an Ida Lupino vehicle virtually from the beginning.  So how did Bette Davis have the chance to turn it down? </p>

<p>Let's follow the story.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" hrefDISABLED="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241b98200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241b98200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino in The Hard Way" title="Ida Lupino in The Hard Way" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241b98200d-250wi" /></a>At the time that <em>The Hard Way</em> surfaced as a project for Warner Bros. in mid-1941, Bette Davis was the top dramatic actress on the lot and amongst the most celebrated actresses in Hollywood. Meanwhile, Ida Lupino was a rapidly-rising dramatic star at the same studio, having made a splash a year earlier in a supporting role in <em>They Drive By Night</em>, and then continued her momentum with co-starring roles in <em>High Sierra</em>, <em>The Sea Wolf</em>, and <em>Out of the Fog</em>. Though Warners was her primary studio, Lupino had avoided signing an exclusive contract, and her next project was a starring vehicle—her first—at Columbia called <em>Ladies in Retirement</em>. </p>

<p>Warners had been building up Lupino as a star for nearly a year and was overdue to provide their own starring vehicle for her. According to the initial press reports, <em>The Hard Way</em> would serve that purpose. <em>The Film Daily</em> had an item on June 5, 1941:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warner Bros. has signed Irwin Shaw, whose "Gentle People" Warners filmed 
  under the title of "Out of the Fog," to prepare the scenario 
  for the Ida Lupino vehicle, "The Hard Way".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next day, Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These heartless, cruel girl roles cannot come too tough for Ida Lupino 
  who doesn't even object to a nice murder now and then—on the screen I mean. 
  So she's greatly intrigued over Jerry Wald's new story, "The Hard Way," 
  which Hal Wallis selects for her as her next for Warners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These were the first press reports concerning <em>The Hard Way</em> that I have found. Could Bette Davis have been offered the part before this? It is certainly possible, though the evidence, if any, is not public. But Davis <em>was</em> offered the role—publicly—a few months later. </p>

<p>How did Lupino almost lose her first Warners starring vehicle to Bette Davis? </p>

<p>Only July 1, a few weeks after the initial press reports on <em>The Hard Way</em>, and while Lupino was working at Columbia in the final stages of <em>Ladies in Retirement</em>, Warners assigned her to the supporting role of Cassie in <em>King's Row</em>. Lupino strongly resisted this assignment, suggesting, according to William Donati's biography of her, that the part was too small and the billing too low.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" hrefDISABLED="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241c32200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241c32200d img-responsive" style="width: 380px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Kings Row poster" title="Kings Row poster" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241c32200d-400wi" /></a>Warner Bros. had severe trouble finding another prominent actress willing to do the role of Cassie. By the end of August, with <em>King's Row</em> well into production, they again pressed Lupino to play Cassie. This time she turned down the role for good, was put on suspension, and left Hollywood for a vacation in New York. Louella Parsons reported that the studio ordered Lupino to report back to the lot at the end of the month for her next part as the title character in <em>Juke Girl</em>—"or else".</p>

<p>Clearly, the Warners-Lupino relationship was in the dumps after the <em>King's Row</em> dispute. On her New York City trip. Lupino talked to the press about how she loved the city, but would "probably" return to Hollywood because she was looking forward to doing <em>Moontide</em> at 20th Century-Fox with Jean Gabin. Left unsaid was that she was not pleased with the <em>Juke Girl</em> role Warners expected her to do, and that she and the studio executives were in another bitter dispute.</p>

<p>On September 18, <em>Film Daily</em> reported that "Warner Bros. would like to have Ginger Rogers for the lead in Irwin Shaw's <em>The Hard Way</em>". No other details were included. Was this for the younger sister role eventually played by Joan Leslie or Lupino's role as the older sister? In either case, <em>The Hard Way</em> would no longer have been an Ida Lupino vehicle.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" hrefDISABLED="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea52a1a200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea52a1a200c img-responsive" style="width: 380px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Juke Girl poster" title="Juke Girl poster" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea52a1a200c-400wi" /></a>The Warners-Lupino situation again blew up in the press two weeks later. On October 4, as Lupino was returning to Hollywood by train, Louella Parsons reported that Lupino had rejected <em>Juke Girl</em> and taken another suspension.  </p>

<p>The same day, in what cannot be a coincidence, <em>Film Bulletin</em> wrote, "Formerly scheduled for Ida Lupino, <em>The Hard Way</em> has been tossed Bette Davis' way." </p>

<p>Warners was apparently so displeased with Lupino turning down two successive assignments, that they were playing hardball by taking away her first starring vehicle for them. According to the Donati bio, Warners also threatened to cancel Lupino's contact.</p>

<p>Ten days later, Louella Parsons wrote that the studio was trying to assemble a superstar cast of Davis, Ginger Rogers, and Cary Grant for the film, saying "it is more than wishful thinking", though salaries alone would make it extremely expensive. Wishful thinking it was, though. It must have been at this point that Bette Davis turned down <em>The Hard Way</em>.</p>

<p>After mid-October, press reports on <em>The Hard Way</em> go quiet. Donati wrote that the tension between Warners and Lupino eased when Warners allowed her to participate in a sequence of the ensemble film <em>Forever and a Day</em> at RKO. Her chapter of the film appears to have been filmed in early November. Shortly after this, she reported to 20th Century-Fox to begin work on <em>Moontide</em> opposite the French star Jean Gabin. <em>Moontide</em> would occupy her into February.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" hrefDISABLED="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241be6200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241be6200d img-responsive" style="width: 380px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="The Hard Way poster" title="The Hard Way poster" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241be6200d-400wi" /></a>Meanwhile, Warner Bros. was moving ahead with <em>The Hard Way</em>, assigning Vincent Sherman as director and working on script revisions. By late November, Warners and Lupino were presumably back on good terms, as she was announced as the star in a new project, albeit one that never came to fruition. </p>

<p>Presumably it was at this time that Warner Bros. put Lupino back in <em>The Hard Way</em>. She was enthusiastic about the revised script she received in December. </p>

<p>And so, as Donati put it, her career crisis at Warner Bros. had ended. Just after the new year, the press was reporting that Warners would claim Lupino back for <em>The Hard Way</em> after <em>Moontide</em> completed. Indeed, she started on <em>The Hard Way</em> in early March 1942.</p>

<p>Of course, by that time, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had happened and the United States was at war. Other crises were at hand.</p>

                                <p>While Ida Lupino was working on the film <em>Moontide</em> at 20th Century-Fox in early 1942, she was reported to be cast in the lead role for another project at that studio, <em>Blind Man's House</em>. Of course, there is no such movie on her filmography because this project never came to fruition. But, with or without Ida, 20th Century-Fox seems to have tried several times over the course of three years to get it off the ground. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" hrefDISABLED="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e973e868200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e973e868200b img-responsive" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Hugh Walpole" title="Hugh Walpole" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e973e868200b-100wi" /></a>The story begins with the British writer Hugh Walpole, who was a best-selling author over the 1920s and '30s. He completed <em>Blind Man's House</em> in 1941, and 20th Century-Fox purchased the movie rights before it was published. As early as January 27, 1941, the trade papers discussed the purchase and indicated that a screenplay was being prepared for the '41-'42 season. Walpole died of a hearth attack on June 1, age 57, after over-exerting himself in a war fund-raising drive—not living to see the publication of <em>Blind Man's House</em> in August.</p>

<p>The book appears to have been well-received. The reviewer for the New York Daily News wrote, "Hugh Walpole's last book before he died is one of the best that he has written in some time, and a fitting close to the career of one of the ablest and most prolific writers of modern England. It is the story of Julius Cromwell, who was blinded in the last war, and his young and pretty wife, Celia, who loves him with a possessive passion." A reviewer for the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote, "'The Blind Man's House' is one of those lesser works of a great novelist—infinitely better than the best work of a poor novelist. ... There is an ominousness about the tale from the beginning. But it is a gentle shadow rather than a really tragic one which falls upon the blind man's house and the quiet little English village. ... Incidentally, 'The Blind Man's House' is highly beguiling—just the thing to keep your mind insulated against the world and the weather."</p>

<p>The movie project receded behind the scenes, re-emerging in the press in early January, 1942. At that point, the role in <em>Blind Man's House</em> was mentioned by a columnist as "one of the most important feminine roles now on schedule at 20th Century-Fox", and that the 18-year-old Anne Baxter, not yet a star, was up for the role against Ida Lupino, a nine-year Hollywood veteran who was approaching her 24th birthday and had established herself as a star two years earlier. Just a few days later, Baxter vanishes as Hedda Hopper wrote that <em>Blind Man's House</em> would star Ida Lupino, with the adaptation to be done by R. C. Sherriff.</p>

<p>At the time this hit the press, Ida was filming <em>Moontide</em> at 20th Century-Fox opposite Jean Gabin. Her primary studio, though, was Warner Bros., and they had their own project lined up for her—<em>The Hard Way</em>. It had been nearly a year since she had worked on a film at Warners, as she had turned down a few roles. She was eager to get back on good terms with Warners, so in early March, soon after <em>Moontide</em> finished production, Ida was working on <em>The Hard Way</em>.</p>

<p>A few days earlier, the New York Times reported that <em>Blind Man's House</em> was scheduled to start in April with Lupino in the lead role. I'm not sure how long production on <em>The Hard Way</em> was scheduled for if things had gone well, but it seems possible that Ida could have gone on to do <em>Blind Man's House</em> without a major delay. </p>

<p>But things did not go well on <em>The Hard Way</em>. </p>

<p>In mid-March, Ida collapsed on the set. She was ill for several weeks with what was variously reported as influenza, strep throat, and, later, "run down condition". Warners postponed <em>The Hard Way</em> until Ida had sufficiently recovered, which took nearly two months. </p>

<p>Sometime in the interim, 20th Century-Fox appears to have given up on the idea of Ida Lupino starring in <em>Blind Man's House</em>. The last mention of Ida's name in the press in connection with the project came on March 10, just a couple days before her collapse.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" hrefDISABLED="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea14377200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea14377200c img-responsive" style="width: 280px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="The Blind Man's House book cover" title="The Blind Man's House book cover" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea14377200c-200wi" /></a>At this same time, Fox assigned Fritz Lang to direct <em>Blind Man's House</em> and Milton Sperling to produce. As of late March, according to industry columnist Edwin Schallert, it was still on track to start in late April. By late April, the picture had not started, but George Sanders was cast in the leading role, with Linda Darnell set for the heroine role in place of Ida. A few weeks later, a new director was assigned—John Stahl.</p>

<p>Still no action, as two more months pass. By mid-July, Louella Parsons reported that George Sanders was taken off the project due to his "sarcastic quips on and off screen", and that Fox was negotiating to borrow Walter Pidgeon from M-G-M. Maureen O'Hara was now on track for Ida's old role, though O'Hara was reportedly about to have a major operation. Variety wrote that the film was now scheduled to start on August 18.</p>

<p>Nothing happened in August. By late September, the trade papers reported that director Stahl would begin "producing-directing" on <em>Blind Man's House</em> after he completed his current project, <em>The Immortal Sergeant</em>. Negotiations for Pidgeon had apparently not yet been successful, but the studio was still hoping to get him.</p>

<p>Several more months pass with nothing happening. In February, 1943, Hedda Hopper wrote that Pidgeon was still being sought for the top role in <em>Blind Man's House</em>, but he would have to wait until he could shave off the beard he was wearing while doing <em>Madame Curie</em>. Maureen O'Hara was again mentioned as the co-star.</p>

<p>Another half-year of nothing. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, <em>Showmen's Trade Review</em> reported that Ida Lupino had been signed by 20th Century-Fox to star in <em>Blind Man's House</em>, which would now be called <em>House of Chadworth</em>. Otto Preminger would produce, and it was expected to start in November, "as one of the most important pictures on the schedule." One paper reported that William Eythe would be the male lead opposite Ida.</p>

<p>For such an important picture, with the big names of Lupino and Preminger attached, I would have expected it to be far more widely reported. But it was not. I have a feeling any deal fell through before it was completed. </p>

<p>Four more months passed with nothing in the press about either <em>Blind Man's House</em> or <em>House of Chadworth</em>. Then, in January 1944, an AP report claimed that Charles Bickford was to play the top role in <em>Blind Man's House</em>. This is the last significant mention of either <em>Blind Man's House</em> or <em>House of Chadworth</em> that I have found. At this point, after three years, 20th Century-Fox appears to have finally given up on the Walpole project.</p>

<p>A footnote that may or not be related: The Charles Bickford mention as the blind character brought to my mind the later film <em>Woman on the Beach</em> (1947)—starring Joan Bennett and Robert Ryan—directed by Jean Renoir at RKO a few years later. That story also involves a blind man with a younger, attractive wife, and jealousy over another man. With minimal research, I haven't found a concrete connection between the Walpole novel and that movie, however, so perhaps this is just a surface similarity. </p>
