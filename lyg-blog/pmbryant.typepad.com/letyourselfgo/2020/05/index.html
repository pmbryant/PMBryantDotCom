		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Recently I uncovered some fascinating information on a forgotten aspect of Ida Lupino's multi-faceted career. Aside from her well-known contributions as a film and television actor, writer, producer, and director, she also co-authored a musical comedy that was <em>produced on stage</em> in 1949. </p>

<p>The stage production was the revelation, since it appears to have gone down a memory black hole. I have not seen such a production mentioned in any of the books and articles I have read about Ida over the last few years, even those by her biographers.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino had serious ambitions to write and produce a stage musical comedy, and she had worked quite a bit in that direction in the 1930s and '40s in her spare time. So it is pleasing to discover that this ambition of hers was realized, adding another item to long list of her show business accomplishments.</p>

<p>My presumption that none of Ida's stage musical works had been produced was based in part on <a href="https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/03/27/apple-tree-farm-a-script-by-stanley-lupino-with-revisions-by-ida-lupino/">a 2014 article</a> by MoMA associate curator Anne Morra — an informative article about a script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> that MoMA had recently acquired. At the end, Morra relates that "<em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was never realized as a stage or screen musical". </p>

<p>From my own readings, I knew <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was the play that Ida was most determined to see produced. She had taken time off from acting and spent several months of 1946 — near the height of her Hollywood stardom — with the lofty ambition of getting it to Broadway. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-classic-hollywood-lupino-centennial-20180216-story.html" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20264e2dd9ce3200d img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Stanley and Ida Lupino in 1935 (LA Times)" title="Stanley and Ida Lupino in 1935 (LA Times)" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20264e2dd9ce3200d-450wi" /></a>This play was something she clearly cared deeply about. Ida's late father Stanley had written the original book, and there was no one Ida was more determined to please than him. Her attempt to adapt Stanley's book, write a score, and produce the play may have been a way to honor him after his early death in 1942. Morra mentions that Stanley's script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was the only script that Ida retained to the end of her life. </p>

<p>Ida Lupino's push to make <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> a reality on the stage may have begun in 1943, the year after her father's death. Late that year, an item in <em>Photoplay</em> magazine relates, "Ida, by the way, is working hard on that musical comedy (she wrote all the music for it) she expects to stage very soon. Producer Lupino! Not bad." This item is consistent with <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>, though there is a chance it could be something else — she dabbled in music constantly at that time.</p>

<p>Events in Ida's personal life likely distracted her soon after that. Her husband, Louis Hayward, returned from the South Pacific a war hero, but devastated by his experiences. Helping him recover, then dealing with the break-up of their marriage in subsequent months took virtually all her energy. </p>

<p><em>Apple Tree Farm</em> doesn't re-emerge as a public priority for Ida until she was working on the film <em>Escape Me Never</em> with Errol Flynn in late 1945 and early '46. At that time, she energetically resumed work on the musical comedy. The press reported that she had written music and lyrics for five numbers and was aiming for it to be on Broadway in the fall.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.com/x/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino and Bill MacIlwinen work on Apple Tree Farm (Chicago Tribune, 1948)" title="Ida Lupino and Bill MacIlwinen work on Apple Tree Farm (Chicago Tribune, 1948)" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b-450wi" /></a>Around this same time, she had invited several men and women to share her household due to the post-war housing shortage. One of these, a war veteran named Bill MacIlwinen, was a talented musician, and in him, Ida found a willing and able collaborator on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>.</p>

<p>In a March 9 column, Hedda Hopper wrote that Ida was taking a three-month leave-of-absence from making pictures at Warner Bros. in order to work on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. She would "adapt it for American audiences and to collaborate on the score with an ex-soldier". Ida planned to have a cast of "unknowns" and to do a tryout on the west coast before taking it to Broadway. </p>

<p>A week later, another Hollywood columnist said Ida was "working like mad" with Bill MacIlwinen. They were expecting to finish in late April, after which they would go to New York City to sell it to Broadway. Late in March, Louella Parsons wrote that "Warners have taken an option on Ida Lupino's musical, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>, for a movie. It's all ready for its Santa Barbara tryout." </p>

<p>Next, the Hollywood press reported that "Ida has signed radio comedian Jackson McCarthy to play in it," and that she and MacIlwinen had fourteen musical numbers written for the play. Singer Tony Martin was said to be ready to try out a couple of the songs on his radio show. (I would be fascinated to know if this actually happened.)</p>

<p>So as of April 1946, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> appeared to be on track for a production in Santa Barbara in the near future. Ida and Bill were proud of their work, as columnist Erskine Johnson discovered while vising the "Lupino Asylum", as Ida referred to her household, on "a rather dull afternoon", with only 10 or 12 people there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I want you to meet Bill MacIlwinen," Ida said. "He was a lieutenant in the Navy. Now we're collaborating on a Broadway musical — 'Apple Tree Farm'. Bill is writing the music, and I'm writing the lyrics. Listen! — he's playing the piano in the living room now."</p>
  
  <p>We listened. Bill was an excellent pianist.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>"You must hear some of our songs from 'Apple Tree Farm'," Ida said. We all rushed into the living room. Bill played and Ida sang.</p>
  
  <p>"My sister's husband is designing the hats for the show," Ida said, after singing four numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next on the agenda was Ida's New York sales trip, scheduled for May 7.</p>

<p>Then something happened — at the last minute, Ida Lupino postponed her trip. </p>

<p>The reported reason for the cancellation was a "serious throat ailment". Soon,  columnist Edwin Schallert expressed doubt that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> would go further any time soon, as Ida was going to be too busy with film work. One of the films Schallert mentioned for Ida never happened, while the other, <em>Deep Valley</em>, didn't end up going before the cameras for four months.</p>

<p>On June 4, columnist Harrison Carroll reported, "Ida Lupino will do a complete re-write on the book of her musical <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. She plans to publish several songs in the meantime." </p>

<p>At that point, at least in the press, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> goes dark.</p>

<p>Six months later, by which time Ida Lupino was starring in <em>Deep Valley</em>, a United Press article about the madhouse of assorted people at Ida's home quotes her saying she is working on a musical for which "the play was written by my father." Signs of life? Or old news?</p>

<p>Another eighteen months — then, in April 1948, a Chicago Tribune layout on Ida includes an undated photograph of her working with Bill MacIlwinen on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. Again, is this signs of life or an old picture? </p>

<p>By late 1948, Ida had married Collier Young, and her household reverted to that of a traditional couple — no longer a motley assortment of people coming and going. Soon, she and Young would be writing and producing their own movies. The time for a stage production of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> had come and gone — or so I would have thought.</p>

<p>But then, on January 28, 1949, just a few days after Ida announced her plans to produce a film about unwed mothers for her independent company — the film that became <em>Not Wanted</em> and launched her celebrated directing career — an item appears in the Raleigh News and Observer with the headline "Ida Lupino's Play Will Be Presented":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chapel Hill, Jan. 27 — "Apple Tree Farm", an original play by Stanley and Ida Lupino of Hollywood, with music by Bill McIlwinnen [sic] of Fayetteville, will go into production next week on the University of North Carolina campus. </p>
  
  <p>The modern musical fantasy will be given here April 4, 5, 6, under the sponsorship of the Laboratory theatre of the Carolina Playmakers for the benefit of the Koch Memorial Fund.</p>
  
  <p>Martin Jacobs of Greensboro, who staged last year's first Memorial Fund show, "Sweep It Clean," will again be director.</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino, the famous movie star, has indicated she expects to attend the performance in Chapel Hill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amazing news!</p>

<p>As I examined the newspaper archives from North Carolina as the April production date approached, I was concerned. Did this actually happen? Did something arise to prevent it?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.com/x/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Apple Tree Farm rehearsal (Daily Tar Heel, Apr 6, 1949)" title="Apple Tree Farm rehearsal (Daily Tar Heel, Apr 6, 1949)" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b-450wi" /></a>But nothing got in the way — it actually happened! The original planned run of three nights was extended to five: April 4-8, 1949.</p>

<p>Ida was unable to attend the performance due to her duties on her film, <em>Not Wanted</em>, which now included directing due to the illness of the assigned director, Elmer Clifton. She did do an interview on a CBS coast-to-coast broadcast the day before the premiere in North Carolina. And she and her friend Harry Mines sent telegrams of congratulations to the cast after the first night's performance. The reviews in the local newspapers were disappointed with the book, but enthusiastic about the music and songs. </p>

<p>Ida was not yet done with <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. At the time of the North Carolina production, she was reported to be planning a meeting with 20th Century-Fox about a script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. A few months later, when Ida was acting in the film <em>Woman in Hiding</em>, working with director Michael Gordon, this item appeared in papers: "Miss Lupino owns a property she'd like to see staged, and Gordon, a Broadway veteran, is, she sighs, the man to stage it." What else could that be but <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>? Ida clearly did not relinquish her Broadway dreams easily.</p>

<p>The next month, Ida told a North Carolina reporter that she'd like to visit the state in near future to visit friends, including Bill MacIlwinen. "I'm still quite elated over Bill's and my collaboration on the musical comedy, <em>The Apple Tree Farm,</em> which the Carolina Playmakers produced this spring. Maybe we'll do another."</p>

<p>And then <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> really does go dark — eventually falling into that memory black hole.</p>

<p>Morra's article suggests that Ida worked on a screenplay version in the 1950s. By that point, Ida was heavily into film producing, directing, and writing. As her Broadway initiative kept hitting dead ends, it makes sense that she would decide to produce it herself in the medium she was expert at and had some control over. She had so many other projects going, though, that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> does not seem to have gotten much attention at that point, even from her.</p>

<p>As the years passed, Ida Lupino retained the script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> — alone amongst the numerous ones that she had collaborated on through her decades in Hollywood. It was, after all, one her father had given her.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the classic 1941 film <em>High Sierra</em>, a small dog plays a critical part in the plot. This dog plays a stray named "Pard" that the lead character, a fugitive played by Humphrey Bogart, grows attached to and adopts. In the credits, the dog even gets billing: Pard was played by a dog named Zero.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.com/x/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e948b9c9200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e948b9c9200b img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="High-sierra-1941-humphrey-bogart-and-zero-the-dog-aka-pard" title="High-sierra-1941-humphrey-bogart-and-zero-the-dog-aka-pard" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e948b9c9200b-200wi" /></a>When reading modern articles about <em>High Sierra</em>, it is common to find asides asserting that Zero belonged to Humphrey Bogart in real life. This is certainly plausible, as Bogart and the dog appear to share a deep bond in the film, and there are a number of promotional shots from the movie showing Bogart playing with Zero. </p>

<p>References to Zero being Bogart's dog show up in some books. An example is <em>Crime Wave: The Filmgoer's Guide To the Great Crime Movies</em> (2006), by Howard Hughes: "Bogart's own dog Zero played Pard." Another is <em>The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies</em> (2011), by George Anastasia and Glen Macnow: "Pard is listed in the credits as Zero the Dog and was, in fact, Bogart's pet in real life." This bit of trivia has become so prevalent as to be nearly ubiquitous in mentions of the dog in <em>High Sierra</em> on social media platforms. </p>

<p>Even renowned experts on Hollywood history like TCM's Eddie Muller have promoted this bit of Hollywood trivia. In his outro to <em>High Sierra</em> from a <em>Noir Alley</em> showing in March 2019, Muller states, "The pooch who played Pard was actually Humphrey Bogart's dog, Zero. Just one more example of this film's spot-on casting."</p>

<p>But the reality appears to be different, as I stumbled across recently while reading old newspaper articles about the production of the movie. This Philadelphia Inquirer article from Jan. 31, 1941 provided the first revelation for me that Zero was not, in fact, Humphrey Bogart's dog. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="https://pmbryant.com/x/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263ec1a5aab200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263ec1a5aab200c img-responsive" alt="HighSierra.ZeroTheDog.PhiladelphiaInquirer.1941Jan31" title="HighSierra.ZeroTheDog.PhiladelphiaInquirer.1941Jan31" src="../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263ec1a5aab200c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a><br />
A shocker for me! Zero belonged to a "talent scout for dogs" named Rennie Renfro. </p>

<p>Other newspaper articles from that year describing the making of the movie discuss Zero, but none that I've found suggest any connection between Bogart and Zero outside of the film production. Plenty, however, mention Renfro's connection to Zero.</p>

<p>A little more research revealed that Renfro was not just any talent scout, but one of the largest suppliers of dog actors for Hollywood at the time, and for years before and after. His most famous dog was Daisy from the long-running Blondie series of films, but he trained and managed dozens more.</p>

<p>The dog Zero had acted in at least two movies prior to <em>High Sierra</em>: Samuel Goldwyn's <em>They Shall Have Music</em> (1939) with famous violinist Jascha Heifetz, and 20th Century-Fox's <em>Daytime Wife</em> (1939) with Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell. Some more research revealed a few films that Zero was in after <em>High Sierra</em>, including MGM's <em>Men of Boys Town</em> (1941) with Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney, and Warner Bros.'s <em>Sergeant York</em> (1941) with Gary Cooper. The last film I have so far found evidence of him in is a poverty row one starring Marjorie Reynolds called <em>Law of the Timber</em> (1941).</p>

<p>While Zero was clearly not Bogart's dog at the time of <em>High Sierra</em>, filmed in the fall of 1940, could Bogart have obtained Zero afterwards?</p>

<p>In fact, there was a story reported in 1941, told second-hand, that Bogart requested to purchase Zero for $600 only to be told by Renfro that the price had increased to $6000. I presume that put an end to Bogart's efforts to obtain Zero. </p>

<p>But of course plenty of this story remains hidden. What became of Zero after 1941? Was Zero in movies in 1942 that I haven't uncovered yet? Did Renfro retire Zero from films after his assistant, Zero's trainer Neil Gazeley, entered the Army in 1941, or for other reasons? If so, could Renfro have sold him to Bogart at that time?</p>

<p>I'm certainly curious of the answers to these, as well as to how and when the urban legend that Zero was Bogart's dog began. If anyone has more info, please let me know!</p>

<p>To close, there is a <em>Life</em> magazine profile of Bogart and his wife Mayo Methot from mid-1944 that contains a posed photo of them with their three dogs. This is three-and-a-half years after the filming of <em>High Sierra</em>. In case it is meaningful, none of the dogs look anything remotely like Zero.</p>
