                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b62e200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b62e200d img-responsive" style="width: 400px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Moontide poster" title="Moontide poster" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b62e200d-400wi" /></a>The movie <em>Moontide</em> (1942) made a big impact on me when I first saw it nearly four years ago, as one of the earliest of Ida Lupino's films that I watched. What hit me were its touching romance, its wonderful performances, and its unique and memorable atmospherics—claustrophobic and dark despite its mostly outdoors seaside setting. </p>

<p><em>Moontide</em> is the tale of the relationship between a drifter and the troubled woman he rescues from an attempted suicide, and the complications due to the jealousy of one of the drifter's companions. </p>

<p>The film was described as a "noir fairy tale" in the 2008 mini-documentary on the making of the film—a phrase which I find to be a concise and accurate description.</p>

<p>What follows is the story behind the making of this memorable film. It is based on what I have learned via press reports in newspapers, trade papers, and fan magazines from the time of the film's production—with occasional contributions from later sources. I would love to be able to explore documents contained in the 20th Century-Fox archives, but alas, that remains a task for some indeterminate future. Meanwhile, the mini-documentary, <em>Turning the Tide: The Ill-Starred Making of Moontide</em>, provides a window to some internal studio discussions.</p>

<p>The story is particularly compelling because the stars of <em>Moontide</em>, Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino, are both fascinating people who were at critical moments in their respective careers. And, among other things, production of the film coincided with the entry of the United States into World War 2.</p>

<p><strong>Origins</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5bf7200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5bf7200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="About the Author page for Willard Robertson" title="About the Author page for Willard Robertson" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5bf7200b-250wi" /></a>The story of <em>Moontide</em> begins with the prolific character actor Willard Robertson, who had been a lawyer and playwright earlier in his career. Robertson wrote the novel, titled <em>Moon Tide</em>, while working on location on the set of the 20th Century-Fox epic <em>Brigham Young</em>. This was Robertson's first novel, yet upon its publication in the summer of 1940, it immediately attracted the attention of Hollywood studios. 20th Century-Fox soon purchased the rights for $30,000. (See this <a href="../2020/11/the-making-of-moontide-1942-origins.html">earlier essay</a> for more on Robertson and his novel.)</p>

<p><strong>Enter Jean Gabin</strong></p>

<p>In April, 1941, Fox production chief Darryl Zanuck decided that story of <em>Moon Tide</em> would be ideal as the first Hollywood vehicle for the French star Jean Gabin.</p>

<p>Gabin had just arrived in Hollywood after several years of resisting overtures from American movie producers. At the time of those earlier refusals, Gabin had said, "I am happy in France. My friends and my people live here. Money is unimportant." But he changed his mind about working in Hollywood after the Nazi take-over of France. </p>

<p>A year before the <em>Moon Tide</em> announcement, Gabin was still in France, on a leave from the French navy, when the German invasion cut him off from his ship. He fled from his home outside Paris towards the south of France, literally a few minutes ahead of the invading forces—in a harrowing three-week journey along roads congested with refugees. By the time he arrived at the port of Toulon for his next Navy assignment, the French had signed an armistice and he was demobilized. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b4f7200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b4f7200c img-responsive" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Jean Gabin in the 1939 French film Remorques" title="Jean Gabin in the 1939 French film Remorques" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b4f7200c-200wi" /></a>Before long, German officials approached Gabin and offered him the choice of putting his celebrity to use in making Nazi propaganda films or else risking confinement in a concentration camp. He decided this was the time to seek work in Hollywood. He contacted a producer friend, Andre Devan, who had moved to the American film capital before the war and now worked at 20th Century-Fox, for help arranging visas and transportation to the United States. Devan went to Darryl Zanuck, who jumped at the chance to sign the French star. </p>

<p>Gabin's signing by 20th Century-Fox was reported by Louella Parsons in late January 1941. Gabin traveled to Lisbon and sailed for the U.S. in late February. He arrived in New York City aboard the <em>Exeter</em> in early March, after what he described as "the worst trip I ever had in my life." Amongst the few possessions he had with him were his favorite bicycle and his accordion. He did not speak any English. </p>

<p>The press quoted him saying regarding the feelings of his fellow Frenchmen about the war:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those who are pro-British say every night in their prayers, 
  Please God let the gallant British win quickly.
  Those who are anti-British say 
  Please God let the dirty British win right away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gabin's arrival in New York City was one day too late for him to attend the U.S. opening of his 1937 hit <em>Pepe le Moko</em>. (That French-made film had been re-made in Hollywood in 1938 as <em>Algiers</em>, starring Charles Boyer. To avoid competition, the original had been withheld from the American market for several years.)</p>

<p>After a week, Gabin left by train for California. He arrived on March 17, ill from a combination of flu and nerves. 20th Century-Fox took him to the desert in Palm Springs to allow him to recuperate for a couple weeks. The studio's plans were to give Gabin six months to learn English before they would expect him to start on any movies. </p>

<p>Gabin reported to the studio in early April and talked to the Hollywood press for the first time, using Andre Devan as a translator. A week later, Zanuck, with Gabin's approval, selected Robertson's novel <em>Moon Tide</em> for the actor's screen debut in America. Zanuck assigned Mark Hellinger as producer and John O'Hara to write the screenplay. A week later, Ida Lupino—a favorite of Hellinger's, who had worked with her on two films the previous year at Warner Bros.—was reported to be Gabin's co-star. (For more on the casting of Lupino's role in <em>Moontide</em>, see this <a href="../2020/10/which-actresses-were-considered-for-jean-gabins-co-star-in-moontide.html">earlier essay</a>.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5ce3200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5ce3200b img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich at the premiere of Sundown, October 1941" title="Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich at the premiere of Sundown, October 1941" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5ce3200b-250wi" /></a>Gabin was a big hit with the Hollywood press corps. "The man of the hour right now in Hollywood is Jean Gabin," wrote Dorothy Manners in early May. The gossip columnists noted that Marlene Dietrich had quickly become his primary public companion, though Ginger Rogers intruded occasionally. (Gabin was in a long-term separation from his wife in France, though the press often portrayed him as single.) The press  frequently described Gabin as "the French Spencer Tracy". This moniker did not please Gabin, but he soon met with Tracy himself and the two became friendly.</p>

<p>By late May, some press reports suggested that 20th Century-Fox was considering putting Gabin into a different movie for his American debut—<em>Swamp Water</em>, to be directed by fellow French expatriate Jean Renoir. These notions were put to rest publicly by mid-June and <em>Moontide</em> was again the target for Gabin's first Hollywood production.</p>

<p>During these early months in Hollywood from the spring to the fall of 1941, Gabin learned English via his studio-assigned tutor, with significant assistance from Marlene Dietrich, and from studying the films of Clark Gable. He felt that to be effective he must be able think in English. Gabin was displeased with the initial script, and Nunnally Johnson was brought in to re-write it.</p>

<p><strong>Ida Lupino: "The most sought after young actress in Hollywood"</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b763200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b763200d img-responsive" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino portrait from Out of the Fog 1941" title="Ida Lupino portrait from Out of the Fog 1941" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b763200d-200wi" /></a>For Ida Lupino, the months between her casting in late April and the eventual start of  filming in November were eventful. As of April, 23-year-old Lupino was on a nearly year-long run of successful films at Warner Bros. since her career-making turn in <em>They Drive By Night</em>. She had done co-starring roles in <em>High Sierra</em> and <em>The Sea Wolf</em>, and was at that time wrapping up another one in <em>Out of the Fog</em>.</p>

<p>Lupino had the career foresight to avoid signing an exclusive contract with Warners when she hit it big there. Her next project was a starring vehicle at Columbia for her and her husband Louis Hayward—the thriller <em>Ladies in Retirement</em>. She had also signed a two-picture deal with 20th Century-Fox, of which <em>Moontide</em> was the first announced.  In June, Warners started preparing their first starring vehicle for Lupino, <em>The Hard Way</em>, which initially was targeted to begin in September or October. </p>

<p>In July, Louella Parsons described Lupino as "the most sought after young actress in Hollywood". Parsons announced that 20th Century-Fox had another project for her, opposite Tyrone Power in <em>Benjamin Blake</em> (later renamed <em>Son of Fury</em>), a swashbuckling adventure film. This one fell through for Lupino, though—perhaps due to what happened next at Warner Bros.</p>

<p>Warners had additional plans for Lupino before <em>The Hard Way</em>. They wanted her to play a supporting role in <em>Kings Row</em> behind Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Lupino did not like the role or the billing. After heated discussions, she turned it down. Warners suspended her and assigned her the title role in <em>Juke Girl</em>. After more heated discussions, she also refused to do that one—and received another suspension in early October. (See this <a href="../2020/11/ida-lupino-almost-lost-first-starring-vehic.html">earlier essay</a> for more on how these events almost cost her one of her iconic roles.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bc06200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bc06200d img-responsive" style="width: 300px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino and Orson Welles presiding at Victory Dinner fundraiser, Nov 10, 1941" title="Ida Lupino and Orson Welles presiding at Victory Dinner fundraiser, Nov 10, 1941" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bc06200d-300wi" /></a>Fortunately, within a few weeks, Warners and Lupino had patched up their differences. This likely smoothed the way for her to shift to 20th Century-Fox for <em>Moontide</em> before her scheduled return to Warners for <em>The Hard Way</em>.</p>

<p>On November 10, just a few days before she reported to Fox, Lupino co-presided at an event she had helped organize—to raise funds to help several dozen refugee European artists and scholars being held in Nazi concentration camps in occupied France to travel to the U.S. Columnist Cal York wrote in <em>Photoplay</em>, "Orson Welles and Ida Lupino presided and never has Cal heard more stirring speeches than the ones delivered by these two."</p>

<p><strong>Production begins</strong></p>

<p>Back in late September, on Nunnally Johnson's recommendation, Fox had hired famous surrealist artist Salvador Dali to construct a nightmare sequence for <em>Moontide</em>. The studio planned to evaluate the sketches Dali produced and then decide if it was feasible to reproduce them. In the end, the set carpenters were baffled by what Dali asked for and the nightmare sequence ended up being designed by others.</p>

<p>As November approached, 20th Century-Fox and Jean Gabin were ready to begin <em>Moontide</em>. Fritz Lang was assigned to direct. Thomas Mitchell was given the role of the jealous friend, while Claude Rains was cast as the "gentle philosopher". Gabin and Lang spent a day at the harbor at San Pedro gathering "color" for the film. For additional color, Lupino, in a story related by her biographer William Donati, took Gabin on a reconnaissance of the streets of skid row in central Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Lupino almost missed her first day of wardrobe tests at Fox in mid-November. When she didn't arrive on time, the studio called her house, and her house boy found Lupino unconscious in the bathroom, reportedly felled by ether fumes while cleaning her hair.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6132200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6132200b img-responsive" style="width: 400px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Noir lighting on the watery set of Moontide" title="Noir lighting on the watery set of Moontide" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6132200b-400wi" /></a>Shooting started the week of Thanksgiving, on Monday, November 24. The plot-line, as reported in the trade papers—involving a potential suicide by Gabin's character and the death of Lupino's character—was quite different from what emerged in the final product. That first week, Sen Young, a young Chinese actor playing the part of a Japanese fisherman, was quoted in the press discussing how the character he played was "unwholesome". He added, in apparent reference to the Japanese atrocities in China over the previous few years, "I think my countrymen will understand."</p>

<p>The large boxer dog that accompanies Gabin's drifter character Bobo for most of the film was discovered by Fritz Lang one day when he was taking a shortcut across a neighbor's yard and was chased by it. Lang decided the dog, named Officer Smith, was a good symbol of Bobo, so he cast the dog in the film.</p>

<p>Jean Gabin's acting style led to some complications with his male supporting cast in the early days of the production, as related by Whitney Bolton of the Philadelphia Inquirer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is Jean Gabin's first American picture and the French star is a noted under-player. He speaks quietly, slowly and in low tones. ... 
  Thomas Mitchell, next in rank, came on the set for work and saw Gabin—and heard him. "He's playing it down," said Tommy. "I'll show them what playing down really is." And he started underplaying.
  Claude Rains came on the picture the third day, quickly saw what he was up against, and set out to teach two seasoned under-players how really to underplay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a few days of this underplaying contest, Zanuck saw the rushes and sent out a short note, concluding with "Get that dialogue up to where we can hear what they are saying."</p>

<p><strong>Pearl Harbor attacked, Fritz Lang departs</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bad1200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bad1200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino in Moontide" title="Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino in Moontide" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bad1200d-250wi" /></a>Less than two weeks into production, the country was shaken by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The U.S. was now at war, and the entire west coast, was gripped by fear of Japanese air raids or even an invasion. Los Angeles harbor was suddenly off-limits to filming, which made it fortuitous that producer Hellinger had earlier had a bait barge set built on the Fox studio lot. This set would end up a large part of the unique atmospherics of <em>Moontide</em>.</p>

<p>War, and the potential of air raids or invasion, did not catch Ida Lupino unprepared. For the previous six months, she had been training and serving in the local chapter of the Women's Ambulance and Defense Corps. The training for the ambulance driving and dispatch duties had involved first aid, mechanics, and more. Lupino took her duties, including being on 24-hour call for emergencies, seriously and was commissioned a lieutenant shortly after the new year.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bbaf200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bbaf200d img-responsive" alt="Claude Rains, Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino on the set of Moontide" title="Claude Rains, Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino on the set of Moontide" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bbaf200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Around the time of Pearl Harbor, Fritz Lang was removed from the project and Archie Mayo took over the direction. Press reports initially suggested Lang and the studio differed over story development. A later column by Sheilah Graham suggested that Lang and Gabin had severe difficulties working together due to the language barrier.  Gabin said, "When I started my first Hollywood picture, <em>Moontide</em>, I was nervous and couldn't understand a word anyone said." After Mayo took over, "suddenly I found I understood everything."</p>

<p>Story changes were indeed made to <em>Moontide</em> right after the Pearl Harbor attack. Fox chief Darryl Zanuck and Hellinger decided to make the ending more upbeat by not having Lupino's character die. Was this, on top of the language difficulties with the star, what led to Lang's leaving the film?</p>

<p><strong>Assorted production notes</strong></p>

<p>Despite the subtitle of Fox's mini-documentary on the 2008 DVD—"The Ill-Starred Making of Moontide"—subsequent proceedings on the set appear to have gone fairly smoothly.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6008200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6008200b img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino in wardrobe for Moontide" title="Ida Lupino in wardrobe for Moontide" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6008200b-250wi" /></a>Several press items cite that Ida Lupino's wardrobe for <em>Moontide</em> cost the meager total of $19.72. A column in <em>Modern Screen</em> magazine expanded on that, saying that "Ida admits depressing outfits have a bad effect on her—make her feel lowdown." So just before filming began, she bought a "luscious new wardrobe to help her shake her gloom after a day at the studio." But after the Pearl Harbor attack, she put her new clothes in a trunk and vowed to stick to her Women's Ambulance Corps uniform.</p>

<p>In mid-January, Thomas Mitchell was being affected by what he had to do for his first time playing a villain. After two days of filming a scene where he had to beat up  Lupino and throw her into a tank of live bait, he was allegedly a "complete wreck". Interestingly, no such scene exists in the copy of the film available on DVD today—the beating is implied via editing. Was the brutal scene cut before or after the initial previews and why?</p>

<p>A few days later, Hedda Hopper reported that Lupino was "limping about with a gash on her leg caused by a fall off the moat on the set of <em>Moontide</em>". Can we presume this was not related to the beating scene?</p>

<p>Director Mayo adjusted his attitude to some repeated airborne frustrations while filming an outdoor scene, as reported by Paul Harrison:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally everything seemed to be straightened out for another try. Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin took their places. But as the scene began, Mayo spotted the approaching specks of a particularly big covey of Army planes. "Cut!" He screamed. "Here come some more Army bombers—"</p>
  
  <p>But even as he yelled it, Mayo's expression changed and his rage subsided in a shrug. He grinned and added:
  ". . . thank God!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On January 30, Ida Lupino filmed an exhausting scene where her character attempted to drown herself in the ocean—filmed in a pool on the lot. Oily scum, kelp, and other floating debris were added to the water to enhance the realism. As related by columnist Frederick Othman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inside, Miss Lupino was swimming and swimming and swimming. It was tough. Every time she was about to go under, something went wrong. An arc would burn out. The kelp would sink. The waves would be too high.</p>
  
  <p>That worried Mayo, a kindly citizen. It pained him to see his leading lady shivering there between swims, and then to see her paddling down the middle of the pool. She already had a cold, and she was feeling badly.
  After nearly two hours of it, she was a weary lady. (The art of the motion picture sometimes is an exhausting one.)</p>
  
  <p>Eleven a.m. came. The waves were exactly right. The arcs were primed. The seaweed was in the proper place.
  And there was Miss Lupino swimming wearily from her end of the pool toward the camera. She was using a kind of dog paddle, keeping her head high out of the scummy water.</p>
  
  <p>"Get your hair wet, honey," called Mayo.</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino tried, but she could not bring herself to go under—too tired, maybe, and too nervous. She got to the middle of the kelp and she almost passed out.
  "Archie," she called, "I'm all done in."</p>
  
  <p>Two stalwarts in swimming trunks dived in and hauled her to shore. Mayo sent his assistant outside for a slug of brandy, strictly for medicinal purposes.
  The man brought back two glasses. One held the brandy, the other contained a water chaser.
  Miss Lupino gulped the brandy. Then she took the glass of water and poured it over her head.</p>
  
  <p>Next she climbed into the ocean, paddled to the middle of it and sank. Perfectly. Everything exactly right, including wet hair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another case where very little of this arduous scene appears to have made it into the final cut.</p>

<p>Gabin's brief shirtless scene early in the film was added at the insistence of his frequent companion Marlene Dietrich. She wanted to show off the muscles he had developed from bicycle rides around Beverly Hills.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5f8e200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5f8e200b img-responsive" alt="Director Archie Mayo with Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin on the set of Moontide" title="Director Archie Mayo with Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin on the set of Moontide" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5f8e200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Robin Coons related some good-natured ribbing while filming one day, as Gabin, with the dog beside him as usual, strode along the breakwater on the set. On the sidelines, Lupino watched him and said, "He's swell!" Mayo chimed in, "What a sweet guy! He's swell!" and other crew members then joined in a chorus of compliments.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino's friend Joan Fontaine was starring in <em>This Above All</em> on the Fox lot at the same time that <em>Moontide</em> was in production. One day, as <em>Modern Screen</em> reported, Lupino and Fontaine were having lunch in Fontaine's dressing room when Fontaine's co-star Tyrone Power asked to join them. The next day, Power brought Charles Boyer from the <em>Tales of Manhattan</em> set. As the days went by, more and more stars joined the group and it became known around the studio as the Fontaine salon.</p>

<p>During this period, Lupino and Fontaine wrote joint articles about each other and their friendship that were published in <em>Hollywood</em> magazine's June 1941 issue: "Loopy Lupino" by Joan Fontaine, and "Mad Pixie" by Ida Lupino. Amongst other interesting tidbits, Lupino wrote that they dropped into each others' dressing rooms daily, and one time they rhumbaed all through lunch before Archie Mayo came in saying, "Get some rest before I paddle you."</p>

<p><strong>After production</strong></p>

<p>As <em>Moontide</em> wrapped production in mid-February 1942, a new romance between Jean Gabin and Ginger Rogers was heating up in the press. The two had a few dates the previous spring when he was new arrival and knew little English. Then in January, he visited Ginger on the set of Fox's <em>Tales of Manhattan</em>. Now they were an item. </p>

<p>"When [Ginger] left by train for her Oregon ranch, it was Jean who had flowers wired to Ginger at every train stop!" reported the column <em>May Mann's Going Hollywood</em>. On February 17, Ginger arrived in New York on vacation and to attend the premiere of her film <em>Roxie Hart</em>. Jean Gabin arrived in New York the next day and was seen "here, there and everywhere" around town with her, according to Sheilah Graham. At the <em>Roxie Hart</em> premiere, they sat in the front row of the balcony and held hands. Gabin had his own press reception at the Waldorf-Astoria on February 20. Ginger was among those in attendance.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6195200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6195200b img-responsive" alt="Moontide Ad They'll Be Gabbin About Gabin" title="Moontide Ad They'll Be Gabbin About Gabin" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6195200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>By mid-April, Fox had positive initial screenings of <em>Moontide</em> and had scheduled the official "world premiere" for April 29 at the Rivoli theater on Broadway. The studio launched a big advertising push almost exclusively focused on Jean Gabin and his sex appeal to women and his working-man appeal to men. They were clearly hoping that Gabin could be turned into an American star on the order of Clark Gable. The ads barely discussed the movie and only briefly mentioned Lupino and the top-notch supporting cast of Claude Rains and Thomas Mitchell. (See this <a href="https://www.typepad.com/site/blogs/6a00d83451ffec69e201b8d2b2365c970c/post/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e96ffa4a200b/edit">earlier essay</a> for some examples of Fox's "Gabbin' About Gabin" advertising campaign.)</p>

<p>A statement about why women were attracted to Gabin was reportedly told by Lupino to producer Hellinger—and fit right in to the marketing: "First, it's his boyishness. You want to mother him to help him along. And then you feel you never know when you're going to get a punch in the jaw." </p>

<p>Gabin travelled to New York City to attend the premiere. Marlene Dietrich accompanied him, as his brief attachment to Ginger Rogers had ended by April. The American Theater Wing War Service sponsored the event, with proceeds going to their war relief efforts such as the Stage Door Canteen. </p>

<p>The premiere was the first to be held on Broadway under new war-time "dim-out" regulations. The dim-out was an attempt to prevent skyglow from city lights that led to enemy submarines being able to spot silhouetted allied ships far out at sea. The customary spotlights and other brilliant displays were not turned on—the only lights on the outside of the theater were the marquee, and those were turned off at 10 pm. Famed opera singer and movie star Grace Moore opened the festivities by singing the national anthem. More than two hundred members of the Free French movement were in attendance and the theater was "virtually filled to capacity".</p>

<p><strong>Reception</strong></p>

<p>Reviews for Jean Gabin were almost uniformly positive. Lupino and the supporting cast were also very well-received. Reviews for the movie were frequently positive, but far more mixed. The mood, atmosphere, and romance that is so appealing to some, including me, was not universally so.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b8af200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b8af200c img-responsive" alt="Moontide poster" title="Moontide poster" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b8af200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a><em>Film Daily</em> wrote, "[Gabin] is a blessed relief from the pretty-boy type that has cluttered up American screens.<em>Motion Picture Herald</em> called him "enormously effective". Herbert Cohn of the Brooklyn Eagle said he is a "vastly appealing romantic actor". Walter Winchell wrote that Gabin "will be darling of the fan clubs when the femmes get over their gasps and organize".</p>

<p>Lupino was also singled out for her contribution. <em>Showmens Trade Review</em> said, "Ida Lupino achieves such a sensitive and deeply impressive performance of the outcast saved from self-destruction that one is easily tempted to single it out as the picture's finest." Wanda Hale of the New York Daily News wrote, "The role of the girl is in the hands of one of the best, Ida Lupino, who has been commanding lavish praise from critics since she gave up comedy for drama."</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Motion Picture Herald</em> said that "<em>Moontide</em> has the indelible touch of art, which assures its appeal to critics, but it also has the indelible touch of life, which insures a much wider audience." <em>Photoplay</em> magazine gave it their top rating of "outstanding" and placed Gabin and Lupino at the top of their list of "Best performances of the month". </p>

<p>Two prominent publications came down more harshly on the movie, however. <em>Variety</em> wrote that "as a box office and entertainment entry, the picture scores only moderately" and that "Gabin doesn't show the spark of Gable or Tracy". They did add that "Miss Lupino shows talent, freshness and perfect adaptability for her role." The New York Times, in the person of Bosley Crowther, described <em>Moontide</em> as a "ponderously moody film" and that "all of [the cast] need much more than a vague and irresolute script, much more than synthetic scenery and manufactured moods." </p>

<p><em>Moontide</em> spent a bit over three weeks at the Rivoli, with what appears to have been relatively weak box office. It then opened across the country starting in late May. In some cities it did very well, but in others, not so much. Given the big marketing push 20th Century-Fox had put behind Gabin, this mixed box office showing must have been a disappointment. </p>

<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>

<p>After filming completed on <em>Moontide</em>, Ida Lupino went virtually immediately back to Warner Bros. to start on <em>The Hard Way</em>, which began in early March. 20th Century-Fox had designs for her as well, with a starring role in <em>The Blind Man's House</em> planned to start in April. (See this <a href="../2020/11/blind-mans-house-.html">earlier essay</a> for more on what happened to this project.) </p>

<p>Lupino became severely ill shortly after <em>The Hard Way</em> began and was unable to return to work until early June. Her next film for 20th Century-Fox, filmed in the late summer of 1942 after <em>The Hard Way</em> finally completed, ended up being the drama <em>Life Begins at Eight-Thirty</em> with Monty Woolley.</p>

<p>Gabin's plans at 20th Century-Fox were in flux. Shortly after the premiere of <em>Moontide</em>, he was quoted by Herbert Cohn of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle saying, "You know, I am a Westerns fan. I love them. Someday I want to make one like Hoot Gibson and Tom Mix. Maybe they will let me." That was not in the cards. </p>

<p>As of early in the production of <em>Moontide</em>, his next project was to be a former Tyrone Power swashbuckler <em>Down to the Sea in Ships</em>. As of the completion of <em>Moontide</em>, the plan was a project called <em>The Night the World Shook</em>, which Archie Mayo was assigned to direct thanks to his success working with Gabin. This project did not happen, though—nor did any other for Gabin at Fox over the next year. He spent a  significant amount of  time working at the Hollywood Canteen.</p>

<p>Gabin eventually bought out his Fox contract, made one more Hollywood movie at Universal—directed by fellow Frenchman Jean Renoir—then joined General Charles de Gaulle's Free French forces and was part of the division that liberated Paris in 1944. He eventually resumed his film career in France and became the legend that is known today.</p>

<p><strong>"When will we have another like it?"</strong></p>

<p>To close out the story of the making of <em>Moontide</em>, here is a quote from a theater exhibitor in Columbus, Kansas from the "What the Picture Did for Me" feature in <em>Motion Picture Herald</em> of November, 1942. It fits my own feelings well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the finest entertainments we have played, which went straight to the hearts of all. Jean Gabin's acting marvelous, and this Lupino girl can act rings around many other stars. They're still talking about "Moontide" here and asking when we will have another like it.</p>

I found it while looking to discover "noir" films, due to its presence in a DVD collection of 20th Century-Fox noir films. </p>

<p><em>Moontide</em> may not be classic noir in its storyline, but it certainly has exceptional noir cinematography. It left a big impression on me—for its touching romance, its tremendous performances, and its unique and memorable atmospherics—dark and claustrophobic despite its mostly-outdoors setting on a foggy bait barge in Los Angeles harbor. </p>

<p><em>Moontide</em> is also notable for being the first of only two American films made by the legendary French film star Jean Gabin.</p>

<p>This is part of a series of posts on the making of that film.</p>

<p><strong>Origins: The novel</strong></p>

<p>The story of <em>Moontide</em> begins with the prolific character actor Willard Robertson. Born in 1886, Robertson began his career as a lawyer, but with a strong interest in writing and acting that led him to switch careers. In the early 1920s, two of his plays were adapted into films. Around 1930, another writing gig brought him out to Hollywood, where, initially out of curiosity, he fell into character acting in small roles. By 1940, a reporter encapsulated Robertson's feelings as, "He has been typed so hard, there is not much pleasure in making pictures, and his only interests are boats, deep-sea fishing and books."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d88200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d88200d img-responsive" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Willard Robertson in 1933" title="Willard Robertson in 1933" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d88200d-200wi" /></a>In the spring of 1940, Robertson was cast as a Mormon elder in the big budget 20th Century-Fox epic <em>Brigham Young</em>, starring Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell and Dean Jagger. The company spent many weeks on location in Utah, the Sierra-Nevada and other locales. Robertson said the only thing to do at nights was to play poker, and he did not like poker. So he retired to his cabin and wrote a novel—his first. That novel became <em>Moon Tide</em>, published in late August 1940, around the time that <em>Brigham Young</em> premiered.</p>

<p>The novel <em>Moon Tide</em> attracted a lot of attention before it was even published. In mid-August, <em>Variety</em> reported that "virtually all major film companies" were interested in the screen rights and that story editors compared the writing to that of John Steinbeck. Reviews of the book published over the next few months were almost uniformly positive. A reviewer in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat wrote, "It is a moving and ironic tale, told with tenderness and commendable restraint." The Chicago Tribune said that the novel "indicates definitely that writing is [Robertson's] natural field."  </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea73a14200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea73a14200c img-responsive" style="width: 145px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Moon Tide novel" title="Moon Tide novel" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea73a14200c-150wi" /></a>A few weeks after the novel's publication, <em>Variety</em> reported that the price for the screen rights had been placed at $25,000, and at some point over the next few months, 20th Century-Fox closed the deal for $30,000. (That is equivalent to well-over half a million dollars in 2020.) Robertson must have been thinking of a screen adaptation early on, as he later said that he had written in a good part for himself. That role, however, would eventually be played by Claude Rains.</p>

<p>After selling his novel, Robertson continued his character acting career. He also found the time to write at least two more novels—"South from Yesterday", published in 1943, and "Oasis", published in 1944. I don't believe either were adapted into films, though 20th Century-Fox appears to have been interested in the former in its early stages, according to a December 1941 item by Oakland Tribune columist Wood Soanes.</p>

<p>On April 5, 1948, Robertson died suddenly in Hollywood at the age of 62. One of his last of his 144 film credits was in the Warner Bros. drama "Deep Valley" (1947), starring Ida Lupino.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41dffce200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41dffce200d img-responsive" style="width: 150px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Poster for Moontide, starring Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino" title="Poster for Moontide, starring Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41dffce200d-150wi" /></a>The leading lady in French star Jean Gabin's first American film, <em>Moontide</em> (1942), was played by Ida Lupino, then a rising young star since receiving major acclaim for her performance in Warner Bros.' <em>They Drive By Night</em> (1940). A few weeks before filming of <em>Moontide</em> began in November, 1941, Ida was quoted saying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone has been hoping to get the lead opposite Gabin in his first picture. 
  It may be a little catty, but I'm very happy I got it. 
  <em>(Knoxville News-Sentinel, Oct. 5, 1941)</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Moontide</em> project had been announced seven months earlier, in April 1941, but had been immediately put on hold to allow Gabin several months in which to learn sufficient English. So during that time, which actresses besides Ida were strongly considered for the role opposite Gabin? Here are the candidates I have heard. </p>

<p><strong>Joan Bennett</strong> </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Joan Bennett" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d img-responsive" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Joan Bennett" /></a>In a short film on the making of <em>Moontide</em>, produced in 2008 for the DVD release, well-known film historian and TCM personality Robert Osborne gives this information. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The leading lady of the film was actually supposed to be Joan Bennett, 
  who had a contract with 20th Century-Fox. But she got pregnant. 
  So what they did is they borrowed Ida Lupino from Warner Bros. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't have access to internal studio documents, but from publicly available information, I have not been able to corroborate any of this. Taking the items from Osborne's statement in reverse order: first, Lupino had a separate contract with 20th Century-Fox and so was not "borrowed". Second, Joan Bennett was making films almost continually throughout 1941. Any pregnancy she may have had did not interfere with the making of any of the other several films she did that year. Also note that her next child was born in mid-1943, a year-and-a-half after <em>Moontide</em> was in production. Finally, I have not found any mention of Bennett's name in connection with <em>Moontide</em> in those newspapers or trade papers whose archives are available online.</p>

<p>This does not, of course, preclude the possibility that Joan Bennett was the studio's initial choice internally. But the apparent factual problems with the rest of Osborne's statement make me skeptical of the claim that Bennett was ever the top choice. Hopefully I'll be able to find more conclusive evidence one way or the other at some point. </p>

<p><strong>Linda Darnell</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Linda Darnell" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b img-responsive" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Linda Darnell" /></a><em>Moontide</em> was first announced in mid-April 1941, shortly after Jean Gabin arrived in Hollywood after escaping his French homeland, which had been conquered by the German army the previous summer. No other definitive cast members were mentioned in the announcement, but influential Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons offered this tidbit: "Don't say I told you—but Linda Darnell is the leading candidate for the femme role." </p>

<p>Darnell was 17 years old and still in high school in early 1941. Despite her youth, she had made a big splash over the previous two years at 20th Century—co-starring in several significant films with established star Tyrone Power, including <em>The Mark of Zorro</em> (1940) and <em>Blood and Sand</em> (1941). </p>

<p>Interestingly, after that initial hint from Louella Parsons, Darnell's name is never again mentioned in associate with <em>Moontide</em>—at least not in anything I have been able to find. But there was another possibility that may have paired Darnell with Gabin in his first Hollywood movie. </p>

<p>For a brief time in late May and early June, rumors hit the press that Gabin could be the star of fellow Frenchman Jean Renoir's first American film, <em>Swamp Water</em>. Darnell was lined up for the leading lady. By mid-June, however, this was shot down and <em>Moontide</em> was again first on tap for Gabin, with Ida Lupino mentioned as his co-star. Darnell was dropped from the <em>Swamp Water</em> cast. </p>

<p><strong>Ida Lupino</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Ida Lupino" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d img-responsive" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Ida Lupino" /></a>After Louella Parsons' one-time mention of Linda Darnell in April, the next woman named for Gabin's co-star was Ida Lupino. On April 23, barely a week after <em>Moontide</em> was first announced, a brief item in the Los Angeles Times entitled "Gabin's Luck" said "Ida Lupino is reported scheduled to appear opposite Jean Gabin in 'Moontide', his first film for 20th Century-Fox, which is tabbed to start shooting in September." </p>

<p>So that's that, then. Ida had won the role almost immediately, even though the film was still many months away from shooting due to Gabin's need to perfect his English. If Linda Darnell or Joan Bennett or anyone else was considered, it was not for long and none of the competitors' press agents were able to get traction in print. Is that the end of the story? </p>

<p>Mostly, but not quite. Six months is an eternity in Hollywood. </p>

<p><strong>Ginger Rogers</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Ginger Rogers" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d img-responsive" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Ginger Rogers" /></a>On May 5, columnist Louella Parsons struck again, writing that Gabin, who was seen around town with Ginger Rogers frequently at this time, wanted Ginger for his co-star and was working on convincing her to take the role. Parsons mentions Ida Lupino as "also in the running". This was just a few months after Ginger Rogers had won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her work the previous year in <em>Kitty Foyle</em>. </p>

<p>Once again, Parsons' reporting led to nothing, as Ginger Rogers' name not does not appear again in connection with the <em>Moontide</em> role. Soon Gabin was seen all around town with Marlene Dietrich. </p>

<p><strong>Back to Ida Lupino</strong></p>

<p>By July 1941, still several months ahead of the scheduled production date, Ida Lupino appears to have been firmly established as Gabin's co-star—both their names are included when 20th Century-Fox hypes their next season's films. And while circumstances could certainly have changed after that point, they did not. </p>

<p>As we saw at the very beginning of this essay, in October, Ida, who was then in a months-long dispute with Warner Bros. over the roles they were assigning her, was publicly expressing her pleasure with the role 20th Century-Fox had given her. When filming of <em>Moontide</em> finally began in November, Ida Lupino was on the job. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b-pi"><img alt="Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin in Moontide" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b img-responsive" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin in Moontide" /></a></p></p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>While researching one of my favorite movies—<em>Moontide</em> (1942), starring Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino—I ran across an interesting series of ads for the film in the trade papers. This 20th Century-Fox campaign is extremely focused on hyping up Jean Gabin as a new attraction for the female audience. They were attempting to build him into a new Hollywood leading man—to the extent that virtually nothing else about the movie is mentioned, but the proper pronunciation of Gabin's name is.</p>

<p>Gabin had been a superstar in French films for a few years, but was virtually brand new to American audiences. He had fled his home near Paris in mid-1940, as the German army conquered France, eventually finding himself in Vichy France for a few months. His life and career prospects in Vichy were poor, as he refused to make Nazi propaganda films. At that point, he accepted one of the Hollywood offers that had been coming his way for a while, but which he had always refused before the war.</p>

<p>Gabin arrived in the U.S. in April 1941 knowing just a few words of English. 20th Century-Fox put him on a crash course for several months before at last setting about to make his first American film, <em>Moontide</em>—based on a novel by actor Willard Robertson—in November 1941. The film was ready for release the next spring, by which time, the U.S., too, was at war.</p>

<p>Here are a series of ads that appeared in Motion Picture Daily and Motion Picture Herald in the second half of April, 1942, leading up to the world premiere of <em>Moontide</em> at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City on April 29. The gallery below unfortunately crops each into a square, so be sure to click on each to see the full ad, or click on one on each row and use the arrow keys to navigate back-and-forth.</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p>From mid-May, here is an ad with a different visual style and a large image of Lupino—but it is still all about Gabin. Ok, Ida does get one mention in a pull quote!</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="display: inline;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41c3188200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41c3188200d img-responsive" style="width: 600px; " alt="Moontide.Ad.09.may16" title="Moontide.Ad.09.may16" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41c3188200d-600wi" /></a><br />
<br/></p>

<p>Anyway, <em>Moontide</em> is an unusual and great movie, with excellent performances, and an unforgettable atmosphere. You should see it!</p>
