                                <p>A few weeks back, <a href="https://brightlightsfilm.com/claudette-colbert-director/">Bright Lights Film Journal</a> published an article of mine—the first of my writings on classic Hollywood that I have published elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>
    <strong>Claudette Colbert, Director?</strong><br/>
    <em>The untold story of how the screen comedy queen of the 1930s and ‘40s nearly become one of very few women to direct feature films in postwar Hollywood.</em>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="https://brightlightsfilm.com/claudette-colbert-director/"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3cf108f200c img-responsive" alt="Claudette Colbert with camera" title="Claudette Colbert with camera" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3cf108f200c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Please follow the link to <a href="https://brightlightsfilm.com/claudette-colbert-director/">Bright Lights Film Journal</a> and read the article. </p>

<p>It was inspired when I ran across the 1949 headline below several years ago—only to find out that I could not read the full story behind this Louella Parsons item because no one had written it! Eventually I decided to do it myself. I hope you enjoy it. </p>

<p>Please let me know your thoughts, either in a comment here or at Bright Lights Film Journal or at my <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pmbryant.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> account.</p>

                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cf6fcc200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cf6fcc200d img-responsive" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Jack Warner portrait, 1955" title="Jack Warner portrait, 1955" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cf6fcc200d-200wi" /></a>Warner Brothers studio chief Jack Warner relates a curious story about actress Ida Lupino in his 1965 book, <em>My First Hundred Years in Hollywood</em>. The story takes place during the filming of the 1940 drama <em>They Drive by Night</em>—22-year-old Ida Lupino's first film at Warner Brothers, after seven years in Hollywood as a top supporting player and leading lady. At this point in her career, Lupino was in the process of transforming from an ingenue and light comedienne into a notable dramatic actress. Her dynamic performance in <em>They Drive by Night</em>, supporting George Raft and Ann Sheridan, would launch her into the top ranks of movie stars, where she remained for the rest of the 1940s—until her attention shifted to directing, writing and producing.</p>

<p>In Jack Warner's story, half-way through what he claimed was a ten week shoot with half a million dollars spent, Lupino notified the studio that she would not come back to work. Producer Mark Hellinger then told him that one of the studio's flunkies, an astrology enthusiast named Richard Gully, had "put the hex on Lupino," saying that "she was just asking for trouble if she didn't get out of the picture." Warner promptly fired Gully, then "drove to Ida's home the next morning—and you can bet I don't often get down on my knees—and I begged her to come back." She refused, so Warner claimed he quickly dug up another screen play that Hellinger could get started on right away with the same cast that had been idled by Lupino's walkout. Warner said, "I determined to wait her out even if it took a long time." The wait took seven weeks according to Warner—enough time that they "finished the second picture." Warner ends on a positive note. "I'm glad we were patient with her, because she soon came down from the Milky Way and we completed the original film. In a seven-year period Ida made thirteen fine pictures for us, and recently--when she became a television director and producer--we had her back on the lot using her know-how in the new medium. Without horoscopes."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cf6fd5200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cf6fd5200d img-responsive" alt="They Drive by Night poster, starring George Raft, Ann Sheridan, Ida Lupino, Humphrey Bogart" title="They Drive by Night poster" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cf6fd5200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Notably, other accounts of the production of <em>They Drive by Night</em> make no mention of such an extensive interruption. Indeed, while this anecdote may have entertainment value, further investigation reveals it to be embellished to a comical extent. </p>

<p>First, the documented timeline has no room for any significant delay. Lupino had tested for her role in early April. "She made such a swell test for the role that Burbank studio executives immediately opened negotiations for a four picture pact with the star." That deal was completed by April 18. The initial start of filming was pushed back a week from the original schedule, a delay attributed in the papers to star Raft suffering from a bad cold or flu. Filming on <em>They Drive by Night</em> started on April 23. Production wrapped by early June, after only six or seven weeks. There is no mention in the papers of any further delays after Raft's illness. And immediately Warner Brothers began promoting Lupino as a new star as a result of her performance, casting her in the lead role opposite Humphrey Bogart in <em>High Sierra</em>.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cf6ff2200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cf6ff2200d img-responsive" alt="Ann Sheridan, Ida Lupino and George Raft in a scene from 'They Drive by Night'" title="Ann Sheridan, Ida Lupino and George Raft in a scene from 'They Drive by Night'" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cf6ff2200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Second, the alleged second picture with the same producer and cast does not exist. Neither Hellinger nor Raft nor Sheridan had the opportunity to begin, much less complete, a separate picture while <em>They Drive by Night</em> was under production from late April through early June. </p>

<p>Mark Hellinger's other productions in 1940 consisted of <em>It All Came True</em>, released in March; <em>Torrid Zone</em> and <em>Brother Orchid</em>, which both completed filming in early April; and <em>High Sierra</em>, which started in August. George Raft's schedule was less full. He completed <em>House Across the Bay</em> for another studio early enough that it was released in March, then after <em>They Drive by Night</em> he didn't start work in another film until <em>Manpower</em> early the next year. Ann Sheridan had been in two of Hellinger's productions that were completed early in 1940, <em>It All Came True</em> and <em>Torrid Zone</em>; then after <em>They Drive by Night</em> wrapped, she moved into <em>City for Conquest</em> in early June.</p>

<p>Clearly Jack Warner's tale of a lengthy walkout by Ida Lupino—leading to a muti-week interruption in the production of <em>They Drive by Night</em>, during which an entire separate picture was completed with its producer and top cast—is categorically false.</p>

<p>Yet there is one piece of Warner's story that is corroborated—and by none other than Richard Gully. Gully's reminiscences are recounted in a 2001 Vanity Fair article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Mark] Hellinger, a writer from New York who “specialized in gangster pictures, 
  had me put on the payroll for one year. I had a nondescript job, just sort of wandered around.” 
  During lunch hour one day, Gully, a follower of the stars in every sense, 
  stopped by the soundstage where Ida Lupino was making <em>They Drive by Night</em>. 
  Lupino complained that “things were going badly. So I commiserated. 
  ‘You’re an Aquarius,’ I explained to her. ‘Your aspects are bad now.’ 
  Right there she announced she was quitting the studio for the day, 
  and her excuse was ‘Richard Gully told me to.’ 
  And that,” Gully said, “is how Ida Lupino got me fired. 
  I never spoke to her again.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there was a Lupino walkout after all—though it likely lasted at most a few hours, making its lack of mention in other accounts more understandable.</p>

<p>There is one other takeaway. For an egocentric studio chief like Jack Warner—notorious for his stubbornness in disputes with stars like James Cagney and Bette Davis where they were compelled to go on suspension or go to court—to invent a story where he portrays himself as driving to an actress' house to beg for her to return to the set, and when refused,  being willing to shuffle production schedules around and wait her out for nearly two months—he must have thought very highly of Ida Lupino.</p>

                                <p>Bette Davis and Ida Lupino were two of the top dramatic actresses in Hollywood in the 1940s. For seven years they overlapped at the same studio—Warner Brothers—yet they had little personal interaction and never acted in a movie together. There was one film, though, where the pairing of Davis and Lupino might have happened.</p>

I was committed to another picture, I'd already done wardrobe fittings and things. It would have been very exciting to do a picture with her." Yet when we survey the happenings at the time, Lupino's recollections appear distorted by rose-colored glasses. She may have later regretted never having worked with Bette Davis, but when she had the opportunity, she strongly resisted the specific vehicle. </p>

<p>The saga of the attempted pairing of Davis and Lupino in the Warner Brothers production of <em>The Corn is Green</em> begins in the spring of 1941. Davis, in her early thirties, was the most celebrated dramatic actress in Hollywood—a two-time Academy Award winner and reigning queen of the studio. Lupino, ten years her junior and new to Warners, was portrayed by press and publicists as the young upstart—a threat to Davis's position after celebrated performances in <em>They Drive By Night</em> (1940) and <em>High Sierra</em> (1941). In this atmosphere, Warner Brothers purchased the hit Broadway play, <em>The Corn is Green</em> and immediately promoted it as a co-starring vehicle for Davis and Lupino. "Won't that be something to star the two queens of the lot in one movie?" famed columnist Louella Parsons wrote.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3b6eb31200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3b6eb31200c img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="1940 Playbill cover for the Broadway production of The Corn Is Green, with Ethel Barrymore in costume as the school teacher" title="1940 Playbill cover for the Broadway production of The Corn Is Green, with Ethel Barrymore in costume as the school teacher" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3b6eb31200c-250wi" /></a><em>The Corn is Green</em> was written by Welsh playwright Emlyn Williams in 1938. It is the story of an English school teacher who moves to an impoverished coal mining town in Wales and mentors a promising male student to rise above the distractions of his environment. The play premiered in London in late 1938. That production's success prompted a Broadway version that opened in November, 1940, starring Ethel Barrymore, "the first lady of the American stage." Sixty-one-year-old Barrymore received headlines and great acclaim for her performance, turning the show into a prodigious moneymaker that would run for several years. </p>

<p>The play has a flashy secondary female role—a selfish young woman who tempts the teacher's protégé to deviate from his studies. This "horrid little Cockney wench" was portrayed on Broadway by an unknown 22-year-old named Thelma Schnee. Schnee received some fanfare for her performance, if few headlines. One critic wrote, "The woman who could steal a play from Ethel Barrymore has yet to be born, but Thelma Schnee, who plays the part of Bessie Watty, does such an astounding job that she comes dangerously close to it."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cabab9200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cabab9200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ethel Barrymore and Thelma Schnee in a scene from the stage production of The Corn is Green, Getty Images" title="Ethel Barrymore and Thelma Schnee in a scene from the stage production of The Corn is Green, Getty Images" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0cabab9200d-250wi" /></a>The bosses at Warner Brothers, production chief Jack Warner and executive producer Hal Wallis, saw the play as a vehicle for their star actress Bette Davis—who could transport the Barrymore role to the screen in the same fashion as she had successfully transported other celebrated stage roles of Broadway stars—such as Tallulah Bankhead's role in <em>The Little Foxes</em> (1940). Warner and Wallis figured the Bessie Watty role fit the villainous tramp type that Ida Lupino had performed so notably in her breakout roles—<em>The Light That Failed</em> (1939) and <em>They Drive By Night</em> (1940). </p>

<p>That Bette Davis would be attracted to the central role of the school teacher made sense, as it would be a showpiece for her acting. The role of a much older woman would not deter Davis, since she relished the opportunity to play unglamorous roles. Davis later wrote that the "<em>The Corn is Green</em> was in every way a rewarding part to play." For Lupino, the showy, but small, role of Bessie Watty was not tempting. The casting suggested she was becoming typed by the Warners producers, which was a major concern of hers after her typing as an ingenue and light comedienne in the 1930s had derailed her acting career. Any reluctance of Lupino to play this role was not an immediate concern in the spring of 1941, as Warners was contractually unable to release a film version of <em>The Corn is Green</em> until at least late 1943.</p>

<p>Through 1941 into 1942, Ethel Barrymore's performance in the stage version continued to draw praise from the New York critics and from around the country after she continued on a national tour. While Warners waited to begin the film production, their public plan continued to be to cast both Davis and Lupino. In May 1942, with filming reportedly slated for the fall, Hedda Hopper wrote, "Bette Davis gets the Ethel Barrymore role for the screen version of <em>The Corn is Green</em>, while Ida Lupino is set for the part of her daughter [sic]." Yet when a trade paper listed Warners' cast assignments in July, the only assignment for <em>The Corn is Green</em> was Bette Davis, while Lupino was assigned to three different pictures. Then in September, Hopper wrote, "It was denied at first, but now it's official that Ida Lupino will costar with Bette Davis in <em>The Corn is Green</em>, which is a Hal Wallis production."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3ba8c49200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3ba8c49200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Bette Davis and Leslie Howard in a scene from Of Human Bondage, 1934" title="Bette Davis and Leslie Howard in a scene from Of Human Bondage, 1934" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3ba8c49200b-250wi" /></a>The production date slipped into 1943. Meanwhile, Ethel Barrymore took the play back to Broadway for a second run, then started on another tour in late June. By this time, Lupino and the Warners executives were in a severe conflict. "Insiders report that Ida Lupino and Warner Brothers will sever relations, two months hence, by mutual consent," columnist Jimmie Fidler wrote. "She's dissatisfied with her roles, and they're irked with her constant dissatisfaction." Of the three future assignments for Lupino that had been reported in July 1942, Lupino had done none of them, suggesting she may have refused most or all of them. Instead, she had accepted lead roles in <em>Devotion</em> (not released until 1946) and <em>In Our Time</em> (1944), although the historical inaccuracies of <em>Devotion</em> also disturbed her. After completing these films, Lupino risked suspension by refusing to star in a re-make of Bette Davis' decade-old breakout picture, <em>Of Human Bondage</em>. Explaining her position, Lupino said in mid-1943, "Bette Davis was superb. She played it the only way it should be played, and I naturally will have to do it the same way. Then I'll again be called 'the poor man's Bette Davis'!" Notably this role was another villainous Cockney type like the role of Bessie Watty.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3b6e854200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3b6e854200c img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino and Ronald Colman in The Light That Failed, 1939" title="Ida Lupino and Ronald Colman in The Light That Failed, 1939" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3b6e854200c-250wi" /></a>Lupino's casting in <em>The Corn is Green</em> soon became another casualty of her dissatisfaction and antipathy to being typed. Lupino's resistance to the role of Bessie Watty may well have begun with the initial talk of her casting in 1941, but was only was becoming public in 1943 due to additional pressure from the studio as production grew closer. In size and characterization, the role is similar to the role she had played in <em>The Light That Failed</em> several years earlier. The character even has the same name, Bessie. In 1939, she had fought hard for that very emotional part. It revealed her talent as a dramatic actress, allowing her to break out of a seven year rut as an ingenue and under-appreciated light comedienne. By the early 1940s, Lupino's stardom had increased dramatically and she likely would not have been inclined to revert to playing a size and type of role she had done at a much lower point in her career. On top of all that, the Bessie Watty of <em>The Corn is Green</em> is arguably a less substantial role than the Bessie Broke of <em>The Light That Failed</em>. </p>

<p>In August 1943, columnist Harry Mines reported, "Jack Warner still hopes to persuade Ida Lupino to play the part [of Bessie Watty], but she says definitely no." A week later, Hedda Hopper wrote, "In spite of the fact that Ida Lupino doesn't want to play any more Cockneys, Hal Wallis hopes she'll change her mind and do the part with Bette Davis in <em>The Corn is Green</em>." A peculiar item then appeared in Erskine Johnson's column: "Ida Lupino is sulking over failure to land the feminine lead in <em>The Corn is Green</em>. Bette Davis will play the part." Of course, Lupino had never been up for the lead part. This deceptive item, likely planted by studio executives to try to diminish their troublesome star, is a window into the bitterness of the dispute between Lupino and her bosses. After this extended period of discord over various projects, Lupino and Warners managed to reach one agreement—Lupino would take a six-month "leave of absence" from the studio.</p>

<p>Warners now started bringing in far less prominent actresses to test for the Bessie Watty part—one of whom was the role's Broadway originator. Thelma Schnee had left the stage run of <em>The Corn is Green</em> a couple years earlier, but the plays she had performed in afterwards had been flops. So Schnee traveled west to do a screen test in March, 1944, and allegedly became producer Hal Wallis' top choice. She promptly fell victim to Wallis' own disputes with studio chief Jack Warner. A reporter wrote in April, "Hal Wallis' resignation from Warner Brothers has held up the deal for Thelma Schnee... to play her original role of Bessy Watty in the screen version of <em>The Corn is Green</em>. The studio wants the new producer... of the picture to okay her first and he hasn't been assigned yet." Jack Chertok soon was assigned as producer and Schnee did not get the part.</p>

<p>In an odd turn, Warners now brought in another Lupino to test for the part—Rita Lupino, Ida's younger sister. Rita was a professional dancer and had not done any film acting of note. Hedda Hopper published this item on May 12, "Ida Lupino helping her sister Rita over the shakes as she tested for <em>The Corn is Green</em> with Bette Davis."</p>

<p>Rita later told more of the story:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd decided, after a lot of talk, and a lot more dancing, that I was pretty tired. 
  Maybe acting wasn't a bad idea. There was a part coming up in the new 
  Bette Davis movie--the part of the young Cockney girl, and I was set to try out for it. 
  'We'll work,' Ida said, and we did. She stood by, right through the test, and we saw it run off later. 
  It was the only test of mine I'd ever glimpsed that didn't make me shrink down in the seat, 
  and Ida grinned, and squeezed my hand. We were feeling high. The job fell through, for me. 
  It was just one of those things, and it was Ida who broke up over it. I ended up trying to comfort her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With Ida Lupino working so hard to prepare her novice sister for the part of Bessie Watty, it becomes even more clear that she did not contemplate the role for herself.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0caba75200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0caba75200d img-responsive" style="width: 280px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino and sister Rita Lupino at a restaurant" title="Ida Lupino and sister Rita Lupino at a restaurant" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202dad0caba75200d-300wi" /></a>A few days later in May, 1944, Louella Parsons wrote that the studio was being "very secretive" about talks between producer Chertok and Lupino. Someone allegedly in the know told Parsons that "Ida is seriously considering playing the role of Bessie." Parsons added that Bette Davis was "enthusiastic about the idea," and that "Ida need have no fear she would be playing second fiddle, for Bessie is as important to the story as is the school teacher." That last sentence, inaccurately inflating the importance of the secondary character, gives away that the studio was making a last gasp attempt to convince Lupino to take a role she appears to never have had much interest in. Unsurprisingly, this did not work. </p>

<p>Given Davis's alleged enthusiasm for Lupino taking the part, this is the most likely time for Lupino's claim that Davis "fought like mad" for her to play the Bessie Watty role. Lupino's phrasing suggests that Davis was imploring Lupino to accept the role. (Warner executives already wanted Lupino, so who else needed to be "fought"?) The producers may even have enlisted Davis to further their cause, hoping that Davis's influence with a fellow actress would be persuasive. Lupino held firm, however.</p>

<p>With production on <em>The Corn is Green</em> on track to start before the end of June, Warners was compelled to bring the casting of Bessie Watty to a conclusion. Established dramatic actress Betty Field was tested, and she seriously considered the role—but opted to do <em>Tomorrow the World</em> instead. Eighteen-year-old Angela Lansbury, recently praised by critics for her role as a Cockney maid in MGM's <em>Gaslight</em> (1944), offered herself up for the similar type part in <em>The Corn is Green</em>. She reported that "the studio said 'no' [presumably MGM, concerning a loan-out to Warners]. I guess they know what they want me to do."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3ba8c67200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3ba8c67200b img-responsive" style="width: 183px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Joan Lorring and John Dall in a scene from film version The Corn is Green" title="Joan Lorring and John Dall in a scene from film version The Corn is Green" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3ba8c67200b-200wi" /></a>In the end, Warner Brothers chose a different youngster. On June 12, Louella Parsons wrote, "You can well imagine the excitement of Joan Lorring, 18 year old, who gets the chance to play the coveted role of 'Bessie Watty' in <em>The Corn is Green</em> with Bette Davis. With such stars as Ida Lupino and Betty Field mentioned for the role, Joan gets a break." Later in life, Lorring said that Warner Brothers had been leaning towards casting their new contract player Andrea King as Bessie, but that Bette Davis saw Lorring's screen test—made after two earlier rejections—and asked for her, with director Irving Rapper and producer Chertok agreeing.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, while filming on <em>The Corn is Green</em> was underway, Joan Lorring appeared on the radio show <em>Hollywood Showcase</em> to be congratulated by Ida Lupino and to do a scene from Lupino's dramatic breakthrough <em>The Light That Failed</em>.  The studio could not have the original Lupino, so they portrayed Lorring to the public as a new Lupino.</p>

<p>In the end, Ida Lupino and Bette Davis never worked in a film together. Young Joan Lorring's break as Bessie Watty in <em>The Corn is Green</em> led to an Academy Award nomination in 1946 for Best Performance by a Supporting Actress. Lorring was unable to convert this success into a substantial film career. Meanwhile, Ida Lupino, despite her prolonged conflict with the Warner Brothers executives and eventual departure from Warners in early 1947, continued her distinguished career as a film and television star for decades—also becoming a writer, producer and director. Ironically, Lupino never received any Academy Award nominations.</p>

At the time the blogathon was announced, I had only seen six of her movies. My favorites were <em>Hangover Square</em> (1945) and <em>Unfaithfully Yours</em> (1948). The others were <em>A Letter to Three Wives</em> (1949), <em>It Happened Tomorrow</em> (1944), <em>Fallen Angel</em> (1945) and <em>The Mark of Zorro</em> (1940).</p>

<p>To expand my knowledge, I  chose to write about a movie I had not seen yet. I initially leaned toward <em>City Without Men</em> (1942). Unfortunately, the copy that I viewed was barely intelligible. So I eagerly switched to <em>Hotel for Women</em> (1939). While that film is also only available in rough copies, the sound quality is good enough to understand the dialogue.  </p>

<p><em>Hotel for Women</em> is the story of a group of young models who reside at a hotel in Manhattan adjacent to Central Park. This was Darnell's very first Hollywood film, yet she has the lead role. She plays a new arrival who quickly becomes a top cigarette ad model, and just as quickly is dropped. Other top roles are played by Ann Sothern as Darnell's mentor, Lynn Bari as Darnell's romantic rival, James Ellison as her status-seeking ex-boyfriend, and John Halliday as a rich womanizer and suitor to Darnell. Elsa Maxwell serves as a one woman Greek chorus and offers this concluding summary:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Men create the world. Women go around competing in it. All I can say is, it’s a wonder more men aren’t shot!</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Monetta becomes Linda</strong></p>

<p>Monetta Darnell was born in Dallas, Texas, on October 16, 1923 to a family of modest means. Her mother had long-held ambitions to be a performer, and she transferred those ambitions to her daughter. Monetta attempted a Hollywood audition in early 1938, and even won a screen test at 20th Century-Fox. But the studio talent scout who had discovered her then told her that she was too young and should return to Dallas. A year later, she tried again. This time she was signed by Fox and moved to Hollywood in early April, 1939. Within a couple weeks, despite her lack of film experience and age of merely 15 years, she was working in the lead role in <em>Hotel for Women</em> under the new name of Linda.</p>

<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c13eb200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c13eb200c img-responsive" alt="Hotel For Women poster" title="Hotel For Women poster" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c13eb200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a><em>Hotel for Women</em> originated several months before Darnell's arrival in Hollywood as a project to exploit the trend of female-dominated shows—a trend accelerated by the success of <em>The Women</em> on Broadway over the previous two years. 20th Century-Fox chief Darryl Zanuck sent screenwriter Kathryn Scola to New York to gain first-hand experience of a "swank hostelry catering exclusively to the ladies," as Louella Parsons put it in a Feb. 2, 1939 column. "Among the guests are highly paid models, career women and others who live by themselves in the big town." </p>

<p>Zanuck signed Elsa Maxwell as a technical advisor in early February, and the film project was officially titled <em>Elsa Maxwell's Hotel for Women</em> to cash in on her notoriety. Maxwell, 56 years old in 1939, was an example of a celebrity who was famous for being famous. Her skill, other than self-promotion, lay at staging notable parties for the rich and famous, including popularizing of party gimmicks such as scavenger hunts. She parlayed this talent into a prominent media career in newspaper and radio. <em>Hotel for Women</em> would be her first foray into feature films. Maxwell not only advised on the film, but contributed to the screenplay and planned to perform a role in the movie. Louella Parsons wrote that Maxwell "will play herself in <em>Hotel for Women</em> and be hostess at an original party such as she herself might give. ... Darryl [Zanuck], who has great appreciation of Miss Maxwell's ability, told me he would give her carte blanche to let the whole world see her idea of the way society entertains."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02eeb200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02eeb200b img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Elsa Maxwell and DarrylZanuck, 1939" title="Elsa Maxwell and DarrylZanuck, 1939" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02eeb200b-300wi" /></a>Fox director Gregory Ratoff was soon assigned to direct the Elsa Maxwell project and Claudette Colbert was mentioned as a likely lead. Louella wrote in February, "The Colbert contract hasn't been signed, but rumor is strong that Claudette will arrange her schedules so she can make the picture." Colbert's possible role was not brought up again. Loretta Young also may have turned down the lead role, according to later reports.</p>

<p>With little success at finding an established star for the lead, Darryl Zanuck set his sights on casting a fresh—and cheaper—face. Wendy Barrie and Nancy Kelly were mentioned at times in February and March. But Zanuck had his eye on young Monetta Darnell as early as March, even though she was not  in Hollywood or even signed by 20th Century-Fox yet.  </p>

<p>Darnell's biographer Ronald Davis wrote that Zanuck "liked her photographs, ran her test footage, and thought she might have enough star quality to play the lead in <em>Hotel for Women</em>. But Darnell had entered a radio contest sponsored by RKO in February, so that studio held an option on her, preventing Fox from signing Darnell. The Fox reps kept quiet and waited for RKO's option to expire in early April. The starting date of <em>Hotel for Women</em> was pushed back from late March to late April.</p>

<p>In the first week of April, Darnell moved to Hollywood and went on salary at Fox at $75 a week. Studio drama coach Florence Enright began coaching her on her walking and confidence. Darnell and her family were cautioned to say little to the press, as Fox was planning a big publicity roll out in the near future--under her new name. Zanuck chose the name Linda because he felt it would "advertise her beauty and suggest a Latin quality that matched her coloring." [Davis]</p>

<p>Two weeks later, announcements hit the trade columns that a "newcomer" was on the rise. Columnist Jimmy Fidler wrote on April 20: "And now a girl named Linda Darnell, entirely innocent of dramatic experience, is to be spotted in the lead of <em>Hotel for Women</em> as a first role. ...  The old-line stars are on the way out; new faces are in demand."</p>

<p>Darnell was 15 years old, but her age was often quoted in the press as 17, or even 19. </p>

<p><strong>Production</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02ef6200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02ef6200b img-responsive" alt="Scene from Hotel for Women with June Gale, Ann Sothern and Linda Darnell" title="Scene from Hotel for Women with June Gale, Ann Sothern and Linda Darnell" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d3a02ef6200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The day after Darnell's announcement, and just a few days before filming was to begin, Fox announced a more established actress for another of the lead roles in <em>Hotel for Women</em>. Louella Parsons' April 21 column included a subhead, "Ann Sothern Gets Lead in Hotel for Women". This is Ann Sothern in the brief period after which her breakout film of <em>Maisie</em> had been filmed, but before it had been released to far greater than expected success. Sothern had been playing substantial roles in Hollywood films for six years and was coming off a career revival after her supporting role in the previous years' <em>Trade Winds</em>. Parsons wrote that "Darryl Zanuck has made [Sothern] the femme lead, which I consider smart casting, for Ann is a capable trouper and always gives a good account of herself." </p>

<p>The Fox studio publicity people attempted to play up a rivalry between the MGM current production that was adapting the stage play <em>The Women</em> and Fox's <em>Hotel for Women</em>. A couple days after Sothern was announced for the cast, Parsons wrote that director Gregory Ratoff had told her: "This is Ratoff's answer to <em>The Women</em>. You, my dear, will have a bathtub scene that will make the play look like a bird bath." Later, a columnist quoted Elsa Maxwell as saying to Norma Shearer, star of MGM's film, "'My dear,' hissed Elsa Maxwell, 'I understand <em>The Women</em> will be released as a trailer for <em>Hotel for Women</em>.'"</p>

<p>Other publicity during production mostly centered around Elsa Maxwell's adjustment to being in front of the cameras, and director Ratoff's exuberance and broken English. An example item from Erskine Johnson: "When Elsa Maxwell pronounced Syracuse as 'Sarahcuse' for a scene in <em>Hotel for Women</em>, Director Gregory Ratoff stopped the camera and said: 'You are working with me only one week and already you can't speak Ainglish.'"</p>

<p>Later publicity claimed: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A momentary setback for Elsa was when she found that she had to stage 
  a cocktail party for the picture. This was contrary to her principles 
  as she has never given one in her life and considers them a commonplace 
  form of entertainment. "Cocktail parties," said Elsa, "are given for people 
  you do not care to invite to lunch or dinner." 
  She solved the problem by staging a lavish party that outdid all other cocktail parties, 
  and then wrote into the script her dialogue which kids this whole institution. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c1441200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c1441200c img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Linda Darnell and Elsa Maxwell walk side by side in promotional still for Hotel for Women, 1939" title="Linda Darnell and Elsa Maxwell walk side by side in promotional still for Hotel for Women, 1939" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c1441200c-300wi" /></a>In late May, as filming neared completion, director Ratoff said of Darnell, "Linda is going to be a star overnight in her first picture." The studio was also looking for Elsa Maxwell's next vehicle. Sheilah Graham wrote that "After her current <em>Hotel for Women</em>, the roly-poly party giver gets a role in 'Public Debutante Number One'. Surely they don't mean Elsa?"</p>

<p>Filming wrapped in early June, and Ratoff was immediately sent to work for David O. Selznick on <em>Intermezzo</em>, starring Leslie Howard and Ingrid Bergman, in her first Hollywood film. </p>

<p>As 20th Century-Fox planned a release of <em>Hotel for Women</em> for late summer, they also gave Linda Darnell her next assignment—in a supporting role in the big budget John Ford western <em>Drums Along the Mohawk</em>, starring Claudette Colbert and Henry Fonda, which was going to Utah for extensive location shooting starting July 1.</p>

<p><em>Hotel for Women</em> was first shown to the public at a preview in Los Angles on July 27. Los Angeles Times columnist Edwin Schallert wrote that it was a "very efficiently made contrivance featuring young feminine players especially and giving a play to romance," with a tired plot line in the final act. He calls Darnell, "Miss Barnell" twice and describes her performance as "pleasing, though as yet perhaps somewhat undefined as a screen personality." He also wrote, "Ann Sothern is very good in her semi-stellar part," and "Miss Maxwell is no Marie Dressler. That might as well be settled now. She is good because she is natural in the few scenes allotted to her, but the role she plays is pretty incidental."</p>

<p>The reviewer for the Hollywood Citizen-News described the film as "unmitigatedly tedious, vacuous and old-fashioned, ... the doings of the Elsa Maxwell smart set, as chronicled on screen, were almost as boring as the doings of the Elsa Maxwell smart set in real life. ... Linda Darnell is still mainly decorative, but she has a fresh and vivid physical appeal and won considerable favor with last night's preview goers. She ought to be in pictures. ... Miss Sothern, like the cavalry, comes on screen now and again to rescue the picture, but eventually gives it back to the Indians."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c144b200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c144b200c img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Linda Darnell and James Ellison is studio portrait for Hotel for Women, 1939" title="Linda Darnell and James Ellison is studio portrait for Hotel for Women, 1939" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c144b200c-300wi" /></a>The most influential Hollywood columnists mostly praised Linda Darnell. Louella Parsons did so repeatedly over the next few days, getting more emphatic each day.  July 30: "She is really a promising newcomer." July 31: "Producers yell 'wolf' so often about their discoveries that it's nothing short of a nine days' wonder when a girl like Linda Darnell really lives up to advance adjectives." Aug 1: "If a star can be born over-night, that's what happened to Linda Darnell after the preview of <em>Hotel for Women</em>." Mark Hellinger wrote on Aug. 3: "The Darnell lassie needs a bit of polish, but she's definitely on her way. Watch her go." Hedda Hopper wrote the same day about Darnell: "There's a real bet if I ever saw one."</p>

<p>The favorable reaction to Darnell after the preview appears to have served like a bat signal to Darryl Zanuck, who shifted Darnell into immediate star-building mode. He pulled her out of <em>Drums Along the Mohawk</em>—scrapping all her scenes already filmed in Utah, and recasting other scenes with Dorris Bowden—because he did not want Darnell to follow up her initial success in a secondary role. She was  also nixed as the leading lady opposite the studio's top male star Tyrone Power in <em>Johnny Apollo</em>. Briefly, she was announced for the lead in the upcoming 'Public Deb No. 1' before Zanuck finally settled on costarring her with Power in <em>Day-Time Wife</em>, which would begin shooting in September. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, <em>Hotel for Women</em> had begun its gradual rollout across the country, opening in some mid-size cities in early August, and more throughout the month until its scheduled openings in Los Angeles on Aug. 23 and New York City on the 25th. Darnell was sent to her hometown of Dallas for the opening of <em>Hotel for Women</em> there on Aug. 17, which became a major local event, with 2500 people greeting her arrival at the train station and another large crowd gathered outside the theater where she gave a short speech before the screening: "Words fail me when I try to express my appreciation for the marvelous reception given me by the people of Dallas. Everything was perfect and my only regret was that I can't stay longer." (Davis)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c14ca200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c14ca200c img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Linda Darnell studio portrait, 1939" title="Linda Darnell studio portrait, 1939" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202c8d39c14ca200c-300wi" /></a>A week later, <em>Hotel for Women</em> hit New York City, where the reception was less than glowing. Kate Cameron wrote in the New York Daily News: "Darryl Zanuck might better have remained silent about Linda Darnell, his latest candidate for stardom, until he had been able to offer her a vehicle geared to take her to the heights of cinema fame. <em>Hotel for Women</em>, which opened at the Roxy Theatre yesterday, is made of brittle, unsubstantial material that is far more apt to throw the pretty tyro for a loss than to carry her safely to the high spot where 20th Century-Fox exploiters believe she belongs. Linda is a beauty with a sweet, fresh look that is enormously appealing. But the part she plays gives her little, if any, opportunity to show that she can act." Frank Nugent wrote in the New York Times: "Beyond this nothing really need be said about the picture except that it introduces a newcomer, one Linda Darnell, who is as pretty as a model should be and probably will not be challenging Miss Bette Davis's academy title for quite a few years." </p>

<p>Much of what few positive notices the movie received continued to go to Ann Sothern—who, since filming of <em>Hotel for Women</em> concluded, had hit it big as the title character in MGM's sleeper hit, <em>Maisie</em>. Cameron of the Daily News claimed that Sothern was the "one really bright spot of the film," while Nugent of the Times added, "Ann Sothern... handles her too-few comedy lines with an ease that demonstrates again that she is Hollywood's best least-recognized comedienne. Some day a script, a director and Miss Sothern are going to meet and bring the house down. <em>Hotel for Women</em> is, naturally, not the place for such a rendezvous." </p>

<p>Elsa Maxwell's feature film career did not last much longer, dying after another role as herself in 20th Century-Fox's <em>Elsa Maxwell's Public Deb No. 1</em> (1940). She continued her celebrity status in newspapers, magazines and radio as "America's foremost authority on how to be popular and how to have fun in life".</p>

<p>Zanuck's Linda Darnell publicity train had such momentum that the tepid reaction that her debut picture received from the New York critics could do little to derail it. Darnell would go on to near equal, above-the-title, billing with Tyrone Power in her second film, <em>Day-Time Wife</em> (1939), and then star in a role very similar to herself in a pseudo-autobiographical film, depicting some of the events of her rise to Hollywood: <em>Star Dust</em> (1940). Less than a year after her arrival in Hollywood, 16 years old, Linda Darnell placed her hand and footprints in cement at Grauman's Chinese Theater alongside long time Hollywood legends.</p>

This release is a pristine blu-ray—a vast improvement over the rough copies circulating in recent years. Finally we have a version in which the stunning cinematography of James Wong Howe and the locations in and around an elaborate 1920s mansion in Santa Barbara, California, can be seen to full advantage. The movie is greatly elevated as a result.</p>

<p>One curious aspect of this overlooked film is that its director, Joel Newton, has no other credits in the film industry and does not appear to exist. "Joel Newton" is clearly a pseudonym. </p>

<p>Various writers have pieced together evidence that the film was actually directed by Bernard Girard, early in his career as a writer, director and producer that extended into the 1970s. In 2013, Jennifer Berzin talked to one of the last surviving cast members to get first-hand confirmation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an interview for this article, Lupino’s co-star Robert Nichols said, 
  “It was directed and written by Barney Gerard. 
  I thought he was very gifted. Ida had final cutting rights and she was not happy with it. 
  She re-cut the film and Barney took his name off as writer and director.” 
  Nichols thought this was possibly because in the final version “she came across as being very 
  neurotic and she didn’t like that and she changed a few scenes so she was less neurotic.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do not have to rely only on decades-after-the-fact recollections. We have newspapers from the time of filming, which took place in February, 1953.</p>

<p>One item by columnist Sidney Skolsky notes that Lupino and Duff, who had married slightly over year earlier, "were rehearsing a torrid love scene for <em>Jennifer</em>. They got a little carried away and Director Bernard Girard said: 'That's not the scene'. 'Yes,' said Ida, 'but that's my life.'" </p>

<p>And now we have photographic evidence of Girard's direction from the Santa Barbara News-Press, February 15, 1953.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only stars Ida Lupino and Howard Duff will appear on the screen in this scene from the film "Jennifer"
  being made at the fabulous Dieterich mansion in Montecito. 
  This candid shot by News-Press photographer Ray Borgen gives an idea how many people are involved in 
  the preparation for each "take" for this suspense film directed by Bernard Girard (far right with script).
  The picture is being filmed at this location in its entirety.</p>

So while, for those willing to do a bit of research, the identity of Joel Newton may not have been a real mystery, his identity is now truly unmasked.</p>

  <p>— Ida Lupino</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751806591200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b751806591200b img-responsive" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ad for syndicated episodes of Four Star Playhouse from Broadcasting Telecasting, May 1956, featuring photos of the show's four stars, Dick Powell, David Niven, Charles Boyer and Ida Lupino" title="Ad for syndicated episodes of Four Star Playhouse from Broadcasting Telecasting, May 1956, featuring photos of the show's four stars, Dick Powell, David Niven, Charles Boyer and Ida Lupino" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751806591200b-200wi" /></a>In late 1953, Ida Lupino approached a major transition in her career as Hollywood movie star-turned-independent producer and director. Lupino, at age 35, had been creating low budget feature films with high production and creative values for the last five years. With The Filmakers, the production company she founded with former husband Collier Young, she served as producer, writer, businesswoman and director, as well as occasionally returning to acting. But now her industry was being upended by the explosion of the audience for broadcast television. </p>

<p>In Lupino's accommodation to the small-screen revolution, the acclaimed anthology series <em>Four Star Playhouse</em> would play a dominant role. When she first starred in an episode of the show at the end of 1953, she viewed television with apprehension and hesitation. At the conclusion of her run of nineteen episodes in mid-1956, she had fully embraced TV as her creative medium of choice—the medium in which she focused her career for the next twenty-plus years.</p>

<p><em>Prologue</em></p>

<p>After giving birth to her only daughter in April 1952, Lupino resumed her work at The Filmakers with her characteristic drive and energy, directing <em>The Hitch-Hiker</em> and <em>The Bigamist</em> over the succeeding year, plus planning and writing a film to star her husband, Howard Duff. Amidst the industry turmoil of 1953, she sought options to diversify her creative opportunities in Hollywood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in 1952, the CBS anthology program <em>Four Star Playhouse</em> was created by agent Don Sharpe and three veteran movie stars: Dick Powell, Charles Boyer, and David Niven. The show consisted of 30-minute episodes, each of which was an independent story. The three actors would rotate starring appearances to ensure their workloads remained manageable.</p>

<p>The "four stars" in the show's name was a relic from a short-lived radio version in 1949 that had featured Fred MacMurray, Loretta Young, Robert Cummings and Rosalind Russell. The initial prospects for TV's "fourth star", Joel McCrea and Rosalind Russell, backed out before the show began, so the fourth position in the televised version would be filled by guest stars. Ronald Colman, Merle Oberon and Joan Fontaine were notable repeat guest stars early on. Premiering on Sep. 25, 1952, the program soon attracted substantial audiences and critical raves, so in its second season CBS expanded it from alternate-week showings into a weekly series.</p>

<p><em>Lupino's first season: 1953-'54</em></p>

<p>In the fall of 1953, as <em>Four Star</em> began its second season, Lupino was completing work on her latest feature film production for The Filmakers, <em>The Bigamist</em>. Her cinematographer on that film, George Diskant, encouraged her to join him on his latest project—<em>Four Star Playhouse</em>. Lupino's response:  "Really George, you're out of your mind."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a4ccfa200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a4ccfa200c img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Caption for newspaper photo from Dec 31 1953: IDA LUPINO STARS ON TV--Ida Lupino learns to her horror that the man she believed to be a real estate agent, portrayed by George MacReady, is actually a psychopathic murderer in this scene from House for Sale to be seen on Four Star Playhouse at 7:30 tonight over WSBT-TV, The Tribune station." title="Newspaper photo for House for Sale, South Bend Tribune, Dec 31 1953" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a4ccfa200c-250wi" /></a>David Niven soon called up Lupino. As she related the story later, he said, "Lupy, Kupy, I know you're against television, but come on over and do a guest spot on our show anyway." She replied, "Oh, Niv, I can't. The whole thing scares me." Niven then said, "Come and do just one." And so Lupino did, filming her first episode in December. </p>

<p>Interestingly, Lupino signed to do a guest spot on a different anthology series, <em>Ford Theater</em>, shortly prior to signing for her <em>Four Star</em> appearance. It is likely the two episodes were filmed on back-to-back weeks, with the <em>Ford Theater</em> episode first. These were filmed just a few days after she  attended the San Francisco world premiere of <em>The Bigamist</em>—which she had co-produced, directed and also starred in.</p>

<p>The <em>Ford Theater</em> episode was titled <em>Marriageable Male</em> and paired her with rising star Jack Lemmon in a comedy. Since the Ford show did not air until February, 1954, the <em>Four Star</em> episode <em>House for Sale</em> marked Lupino's television debut as an actress—on the last day of the year 1953. </p>

<p><em>House for Sale</em> is a well-done thriller, where Lupino's character meets up with a man she thinks is a real estate agent for an open house—but the man is actually a psychopathic murderer. Such "woman in peril" roles were not Lupino's favorites, but came up repeatedly in her acting jobs in the first half of the 1950s, both in films and in her work on <em>Four Star Playhouse</em>.  </p>

<p>For the remainder of the 1953-'54 season, Lupino did one more episode of <em>Ford Theater</em>, co-starring her husband Howard Duff, and two more episodes of <em>Four Star Playhouse</em>. Her primary focus continued to be on producing, writing and acting in feature films. The Filmakers production, <em>Private Hell 36</em>, occupied much of her energies for the first part of 1954. </p>

<p>Her company was struggling for existence by late 1954, however, and Lupino ramped up her television work in response. She also took the first of a handful of modest roles in feature films over the next few years—<em>Women's Prison</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lupino's second season: 1954-'55</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a4cd27200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a4cd27200c img-responsive" style="width: 280px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Caption for newspaper photo from Mar 17, 1955: WHAT A DIFFERENCE MAKEUP MAKES IN IDA.

Special padding and makeup wrought the transformation." title="Newspaper photo of Ida Lupino for episode With All My Heart, Hollywood Citizen-News, Mar 17 1955" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a4cd27200c-300wi" /></a>Lupino focused her increased television work on <em>Four Star Playhouse</em> to the exclusion of other dramatic shows, heading six episodes. During this period, she officially left The Filmakers—promptly starting a new production company with husband Duff and ex-husband Young. The initial focus of this effort was on developing a sitcom to star her and Duff, satirizing their real-life roles as married movie stars with a stormy relationship. She dabbled in acting in feature films, taking top supporting roles in two major productions, <em>The Big Knife</em> and <em>While the City Sleeps</em>.</p>

<p>Her first <em>Four Star</em> episode of the season was <em>The Adolescent</em>, where she played a school teacher and disciplinarian called on to investigate misconduct involving her nephew. Columnist Eve Starr wrote: "Ida Lupino did it again on Four Star Playhouse's 'The Adolescent,' who was very well handled by young Robert Arthur. But we liked best of all Ida's few added pounds—and that's strictly a pure and sweet compliment. Her pretty face is prettier."</p>

<p>The next episode was another drama involving a youngster, <em>Marked Down</em>—though here, Lupino played a gold-digging woman. TV host Faye Emerson wrote that Lupino "sashayed stylishly through a script that had both tenderness and wit."</p>

<p>Later in the season, she played opposite William Talman in <em>Eddie's Place</em>. Talman had portrayed the title character in the earlier Lupino-directed feature film, <em>The Hitch-Hiker</em>. In a clever allusion to their previous association, the teleplay opens with Talman, driving a truck, picking up a stranded Lupino on a deserted road.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b7518065db200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b7518065db200b img-responsive" style="width: 280px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Caption for newspaper photo from June 25, 1955: Ida Lupino and Franchot Tone comprise the cast of Award, a tale about a Hollywood actress, appearing on 12's Four-Star Playhouse Thursday at 9:30 p.m." title="Cover of TV Magazine newspaper insert for Cincinnati Enquirer for week of June 25 - July 1, 1955 with photo of Ida Lupino and Franchot Tone in Award episode of Four Star Playhouse" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b7518065db200b-300wi" /></a><em>With All My Heart</em>, aired on April 21, 1955, was one of the most notable episodes for Lupino and the press. She donned a false body to portray an overweight teacher in love with a man who viewed her as his best friend. She told columnist Aline Mosby that she wasn't concerned about losing her figure for art "because I've never gone through that frightening period of having been a glamour girl." She added, "Ever since I remember, I've played offbeat characters. When I read this script I wanted to do it. It's a wonderful love story. It doesn't make fun of fat people. It shows that it isn't what you look like, but what you are inside that people love." A year later, Lupino said that the most fan mail she had gotten during her <em>Four Star</em> tenure had been for this role.</p>

<p>She finished the season with <em>Award</em>, aired June 30. Lupino portrayed an Oscar-winning movie star who has just suffered horrendous reviews of her performance in her first Broadway show. Fellow Hollywood veteran Franchot Tone played a Broadway director that she approaches to help her improve. The show takes place on a single set with only the two actors and is quite lively. After <em>Award</em> was broadcast, Lupino told a columnist that the episode was based on true events: "'How we got away with it I'll never know,' [Lupino] grinned. 'But I'm not saying who the actress really is. Let people guess.'"</p>

<p><em>Lupino's third and final season: 1955-'56</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b6853762e5200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b6853762e5200d img-responsive" style="width: 280px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Caption for newspaper photo, Oct 9, 1955: WHAT MAKE-UP CAN DO--Ida Lupino will appear as both a girl of 20 and a woman celebrating her hundredth birthday when Four Star Playhouse present The Face of Danger next Thursday at 9:30 p.m. on Channel 7" title="Newspaper photo of Ida Lupino for episode Face of Danger, Boston Globe, Oct 9, 1955" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b6853762e5200d-300wi" /></a>By the second half of 1955, Lupino's focus had shifted almost completely to television. Her work on the pilot for her sitcom had come to fruition and it was slotted as an episode of <em>Four Star Playhouse</em> for the upcoming season. (It was filmed in the fall of 1955, but its airing was held back until the official sitcom run in early 1957.) She also signed on as the permanent "fourth star" and led a full complement of ten episodes that season. </p>

<p><em>TV Guide</em> published a feature about her <em>Four Star</em> work in December, titled "A Fourth for TV: Ida Lupino joins trio of stars in film series". </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At her admitted 35, Miss Lupino retains a remarkably trim "figgah", as her British relatives like to call it. ... The "figgah" is topped by an equally trim mind that, at least in the ways of business, works like a man's. ...</p>
  
  <p>"A dame," says outspoken Dick Powell, "can stop to powder her nose at the wrong time and $3000 goes dow the drain. 'Lupey' knows when to powder and when not to powder."</p>
  
  <p>Lupey, in fact, knows just about everything there is to know, as far as the making of pictures is concerned, and this includes an acute understanding of the budget.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Director Roy Kellino then extolled Lupino's virtues: "Miss Lupino is a professional. She is a trouper. She is never late. She always knows her lines. She knows how to improvise. And she will stand all day on a recently broken ankle because she knows that if the picture goes into another day of shooting, it will cost more money. I admire Miss Lupino tremendously."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b68537632a200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b68537632a200d img-responsive" alt="Column headline from Feb 2, 1956, Ida Lupino Plots To Be a Widow.

And, outside of <em>Four Star</em>, she resumed directing work—helming an episode of <em>Screen Directors Playhouse</em> for which she also had written the story. Lupino never directed any of her own <em>Four Star</em> episodes, saying of her acting, "I need a director."</p>

<p>Some of her notable episodes this season were <em>Face of Danger</em>, a western in which she played the same person in her 20s and at 100; <em>One Way Out</em>, another woman-in-peril story, but a particularly well-executed one that Lupino and <em>Four Star</em> considered turning into a feature film; and <em>The Listener</em>, where Lupino co-starred opposite her younger cousin, Richard Lupino, and played one of the most amoral characters of her career. For <em>The Story of Emily Cameron</em>, she wrote the original story, described in a  contemporary summary as "about a woman who concocts a diabolical scene of wreaking vengeance upon her husband".</p>

<p>Lupino's work on <em>Four Star Playhouse</em> concluded with the airing on July 19, 1956 of one the best episodes—<em>The Stand-In</em>. Newspapers summarized her role as a woman "whose twenty bitter years in Hollywood as 'The Stand-In' for a star turn ambition to despair and her affection to secret hate." This episode was another that was adapted from an original story written by Lupino.</p>

<p><em>Show's End</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751806677200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b751806677200b img-responsive" style="width: 280px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="First page of TV Guide article from Dec 3, 1955 titled A Fourth For TV, with color photo of smiling Ida Lupino in nightgown costume for One Way Out episode" title="First page of TV Guide article from Dec 3, 1955 titled A Fourth For TV, with color photo of smiling Ida Lupino in nightgown costume for One Way Out episode" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751806677200b-300wi" /></a>In early 1956, Charles Boyer described the program to the press: "We, and I mean partners in 'Four Star Playhouse', Dick Powell, David Niven and Ida Lupino, have worked out a wonderful method of doing TV. But even doing a show once every four weeks becomes a chore after a while. It's like having a wildcat by the tail. You have to keep swinging."</p>

<p><em>Four Star Playhouse</em> ceased production after the 1955-'56 season. While the show remained a hit with audiences and the sponsor wanted to continue, the CBS network gave the Thursday time slot to a new prestige dramatic show, <em>Playhouse 90</em>. Dick Powell, who had become the primary business force behind <em>Four Star</em>, was mollified by CBS picking up his new anthology show, <em>Zane Grey Theater</em>. </p>

<p>If somehow <em>Four Star</em> had continued into 1956-'57, Ida Lupino would not have been a part of it. CBS had picked up her sitcom with Howard Duff, <em>Mr. Adams and Eve</em>, and she was busy producing dozens of episodes to begin airing just after the new year.</p>

<p>A May 1956 article in the Pittsburgh Press described Lupino's experience over her three seasons on <em>Four Star Playhouse</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I never thought I could like TV," said Ida Lupino recently.
  That this attitude has undergone a radical change goes without saying, for she is now intimately identified with television as actress, director, writer and a shrewd investor. </p>
  
  <p>“It’s a man’s world,” she says, ”and I’m glad I’m in it.” ...
  “I’ve known each one of them 20 years or more,” she says of her colleagues.
  “I’ve known David [Niven] 23 years. Boyer, I’ve known at least 20 years. 
  I met Dick Powell the first weeks he was in Hollywood—that must be 24 years ago. I’m terribly fond of them all.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A decade later, she wrote about <em>Four Star</em>, "I was the guest who never left... and loved every minute of it—and never missed directing."</p>

<p>The final word on Lupino's <em>Four Star</em> run came a few months after the final episode aired at the end of July, 1956. During the early weeks of the airing of her new sitcom, in February 1957, Lupino received an Emmy nomination for Best Continuing Performance in a Dramatic Series for her prior year's work on <em>Four Star Playhouse</em>.</p>

<p>Reruns of <em>Four Star Playhouse</em> continued for many years, released under different names. At times, the episodes for each of the stars were packaged separately, and so in the late 1950s and early '60s there was an "Ida Lupino Show" on many TV listings. As of this writing, nearly seventy years after their creation, sixteen of Lupino's nineteen episodes are available to view online.</p>

Only one of these two women is in this picture. At center is Ida Lupino, future movie star, producer and director—in make-up as the lead character in a stage production for Paramount studios. Off-camera is the director of the production, Phyllis Loughton. </p>

<p>At the time of the photo, Lupino was brand new to Hollywood and barely a year into her storied career in the public eye, while Loughton—“one-time child prodigy of the stage”—was also brand new to Hollywood, beginning her behind-the scenes career.</p>

<p>In December 1933, just a few weeks before this photo was taken, Phyllis Loughton had founded a stock company at Paramount to facilitate the training of the studio’s young actors and actresses. Today, the most famous of the classic Hollywood studio stock companies was the one run by Lela Rogers, Ginger Rogers' mother, at RKO—where legendary comedienne Lucille Ball received her early training. But Rogers’ school was over a year in the future when Loughton convinced Paramount to start their stock company. When Rogers was launching RKO's Little Theater in 1935, a Los Angeles reporter wrote, "It was Miss Loughton at Paramount who introduced the stage production idea to studios."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: left;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b7517f100d200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b7517f100d200b img-responsive" style="width: 140px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" alt="News photo announcing Phyllis Loughton's arrival as a coach at Paramount, Mount Carmel Item, Sep. 18, 1933" title="News photo announcing Phyllis Loughton's arrival as a coach at Paramount, Mount Carmel Item, Sep. 18, 1933" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b7517f100d200b-150wi" /></a>Ida Lupino and Phyllis Loughton arrived at Paramount nearly simultaneously, in late August 1933. At the time, Lupino was a 15-year-old movie actress from England and Loughton was a 26-year-old stage director from Detroit via Broadway. Lupino had played leading roles in six British films over the previous year when Paramount signed her and brought her to Hollywood as a top candidate for the role of Alice in their much-hyped production of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. More quietly, Paramount hired Loughton to take charge of training the studio's players in "diction, deportment and decorum". </p>

<p>Paramount soon decided not to cast Lupino as Alice, but rather give the role to Charlotte Henry. Lupino was destined for more adult features. "Miss Lupino... is a year younger in age [than Henry] and ten years older in experience and poise," wrote a columnist that November.</p>

<p>Lupino's first Hollywood movie, <em>Search for Beauty</em>, had her co-starring opposite Larry "Buster" Crabbe, an Olympic swimming champion making one of his earliest movies. Filmed in the late fall of 1933, this picture was the culmination of an international talent contest promoted by Paramount, where several dozen young men and women winners were brought to Hollywood to appear briefly in the movie. Six of these were signed to Paramount contracts. (Only one of the six had a Hollywood career of any length, an eighteen-year-old from Texas named Clara Lou Sheridan, who changed her name to Ann Sheridan the next year.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a373f6200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a373f6200c img-responsive" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Buster Crabbe and Ida Lupino pose for 'Search for Beauty'" title="Buster Crabbe and Ida Lupino pose for 'Search for Beauty'" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a373f6200c-200wi" /></a>At the same time, Phyllis Loughton convinced her new bosses to fund a stock company under her charge for the training of the studio's young talent. Under the headline "Young Picture Group to Do Stage Plays" on December 5, Los Angeles Times columnist Edwin Schallert wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All for the sake of experience, a whole group of younger film players are going to do stage plays. The idea is being experimented with at the Paramount studio, and if it works out well, maybe the young stars will be seen in a public performance occasionally. </p>
  
  <p>They include Larry (Buster) Crabbe, Ida Lupino, Kent Taylor, Barbara Fritchie, Toby Wing, Lona Andre, and the “Search for Beauty” group, including Eldred Tidbury, Colin Tapley, Alfred Delcambre, Julian Madison, Clara Lou Sheridan and Gwenllian Gill. 
  There will probably be about sixty-five ready and willing to take part, and the plays will be presented in a theater set on one of the studio stages. </p>
  
  <p>Phyllis Loughton, formerly with Jessie Bonstelle’s stock company in Detroit, and who has directed plays in the East, will have charge of the undertaking. 
  At the start, the plays will be given just before the company’s own employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first production of Loughton's company would be "Double Door"—a hit on Broadway a few months before and a story which Paramount was planning to film. "It is a grim melodrama of the inhumanities a rich woman practices upon her brother's bride to preserve intact the family fortune and the pearls," wrote Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times about the Broadway version. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b7517f0fb5200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b7517f0fb5200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Seated, Phyllis Loughton works with Ida Lupino, in old age makeup for 'Double Door', with Gwenllian Gill and Lona Andre behind them" title="Seated, Phyllis Loughton works with Ida Lupino, in old age makeup, with Gwenllian Gill and Lona Andre behind them, also in old age makeup" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b7517f0fb5200b-250wi" /></a>Eleven players had parts in the Paramount stage version, with Ida Lupino in the leading role. While this production was not a public event, Paramount milked for publicity the old age make-up on Lupino and two other teenage actresses. Some press was also invited to witness the performance, which took place on January 12, 1934, barely a month after the first public announcement of Loughton's stock company.</p>

<p>The Detroit Free Press wrote up a brief item the next day:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phyllis Loughton, Detroit actress and director, and now diction coach for Paramount, is in charge of the studio stock company, the purpose of which is to give screen aspirants acting experience. </p>
  
  <p>The first production by the studio stock company was made Friday night, before an audience of newspaper critics, picture stars, directors and other studio workers. </p>
  
  <p>"Double Door" was the offering, not the least important feature of which was the fact that youthful Ida Lupino portrayed the role of a fifty-five-year-old matron, 
  with Gwenllian Gill, another starling, appearing as a fifty-year-old spinster."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b685361c2d200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b685361c2d200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Newpaper photo of the 3 teenagers in old age make-up superimposed on photos of them in more typical attire.

Caption: Look at them again--they're same girls" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b685361c2d200d-250wi" /></a>George Shaffer wrote in the New York Daily News: "Ida Lupino did a highly creditable piece of dramatic acting in the studio's own stage presentation of "Double Door" by eleven members of the young talent at Paramount.... [T]he 18-year-old British lass played a woman in her sixties, stooped, over-bearing, with gray complexion and streaked brown hair." </p>

<p>Note that mistake in Lupino's age. She was in fact several weeks shy of her sixteenth birthday. But Paramount and Lupino both encouraged the press and public to believe she was older.</p>

<p>Syndicated columnist Robbin Coons wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The other night Paramount's school, under the direction of Phyllis Loughton, presented a production of "Double Door," a play that will soon be made into a film. 
  Executives, writers, and directors saw performances from mere cinematic youngsters that may make them think twice.</p>
  
  <p>They saw Ida Lupino, a 17-year-old blonde, give a convincing portrayal of an aged, sour-on-life spinster, and Gwenllian Gill, a beauty contest winner, enact Ida's intimidated spinster sister. ... and Larry (Buster) Crabbe had one of his rare opportunities to emote with all his clothes on.</p>
  
  <p>Lona Andre, Julian Madison, Clara Lou Sheridan, Eldred Tilbury, Colin Tapley, and Alfred Delcambre, all contest-winners, had their shining moments.</p>
  
  <p>Aside from giving the youngsters something to do—and Miss Loughton avers that they all work like Trojans—and showing executives what they can do, the studio plays have the added value of giving the screen adapters hints regarding dramatic values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paramount extracted further publicity by proclaiming that Lupino's performance in "Double Door" had won her the leading feminine role in the film <em>Come On Marines</em> opposite Richard Arlen, which was to begin filming in late January. In fact, Lupino had been announced for this role several months earlier, albeit in a more tentative stage of production. (At that time, not-yet-superstar Cary Grant had been the prospective leading man.) </p>

<p>A few weeks after the stock company performance, <em>Search for Beauty</em> was released to theaters and Lupino sat for interviews. Robbin Coons described her as "a blue-eyed blonde of 17 who is dead-set against a screen career devoted to the portrayal of blue-eyed blondes of 17." She told him: "I'll not do it, I say! I'm not going to stay here [in Hollywood] to be an ingenue." Coons wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Miss Lupino recently played an aged spinster in a studio play, the leading role in one of those productions staged by the junior players. It was a characterization far removed from her first screen role in "The Search for Beauty."</p>
  
  <p>"I can do parts like that spinster for the screen. I want to do them, to play real characters. ... And I don't care what I look like on the screen. They can hollow my cheeks, gray my hair, dress me in rags and I'll be happy if I'm playing a real person. I don't care if I'm popular of not. That doesn't matter as long as I know I'm doing good work."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ida Lupino and Phyllis Loughton worked together on at least one more stock company production. A few months later, the company's second production, "The Pursuit of Happiness", was staged with Lupino again in the lead role. This was another recent Broadway play that Paramount was planning to film. Los Angeles Times columnist Edwin Schallert wrote on May 29, 1934:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It looks as if it will be a very, very private affair, because royalties are involved if any outsiders see such a production. 
  So the principals of the play, including Ida Lupino, Toby Wing, Randolph Scott, Eldred Tilbury, Alfred Delcambre, Clara Lou Sheridan, Julian Madison, Howard Wilson, Colin Tapley, Frank Losee and Douglas James, 
  a number of them being 'Search for Beauty' contest winners, will do their emoting before an aggregation of their own studio folks. </p>
  
  <p>The production is being given under the direction of Phyllis Laughton [sic].</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a373de200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a373de200c img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="The foursome in the background is Katherine De Mille, Melville Shauer, Ida Lupino, and Clara Lou (Ann) Sheridan" title="The foursome in the background is Katherine De Mille, Melville Shauer, Ida Lupino, and Clara Lou (Ann) Sheridan" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b751a373de200c-250wi" /></a>The only photographic evidence I have found related to this play is from a pool party thrown afterwards to celebrate the young players' work. Lupino has her arm around Clara Lou (Ann) Sheridan, talking to actress Katherine De Mille and Paramount executive Melville Shauer, the host.</p>

<p>Just a couple weeks after this party, Lupino would be stricken with polio. Paramount delayed production of her next film, <em>Ready for Love</em>, until she was fit to participate. Fortunately, she recovered nearly completely within a few weeks. Later in 1934, Lupino and her mother travelled back to England to reunite with her father and sister for a vacation of several months, then returned to Hollywood and Paramount in January 1935.</p>

<p>Over the next few years, Lupino would not get the kind of dramatic screen roles she desired. Instead she was typed as an ingenue and light comedienne. She nonetheless persevered in Hollywood. It would take a prolonged career crisis in the late 1930s and a bold venture into the office of director William Wellman to land her the role in <em>The Light That Failed</em> (1939) that launched her celebrated dramatic career. </p>

<p>In the late 1940s, Lupino started her own production company, with one of the goals to train young actors and actresses—a venture that led to her becoming the only woman director in Hollywood in the post-war era. Could Lupino's desire to foster young talent have been inspired, at least in part, by the example of Phyllis Loughton?</p>

Her work with young actors like Randolph Scott and Fred MacMurray was written up frequently in the press. In 1937, internal studio politics led to her being forced out of Paramount. Director Cecil B. DeMille, furious at how she had been treated, called her up to offer encouragement, saying, "Always remember, no one can fire you but yourself. Carry on."</p>

<p>Loughton continued her Hollywood career for over another decade, becoming an acting coach for big name stars such as Dorothy Lamour, Hedy Lamarr, Paulette Goddard and Ann Sothern. She worked closely with director Mitchell Leisen and almost became a director herself at various points in the 1940s.</p>

<p>As the 1950s began, Loughton left her Hollywood work behind and concentrated on raising her family. Soon, she became deeply involved in local politics under her married name, Phyllis Seaton. After a substantial political career, in 1973 she was elected by her fellow city council members as the first woman mayor of Beverly Hills—forty years after she had arrived in Southern California and founded the dramatic school for young players at Paramount studio.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b75198d4a3200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202b75198d4a3200c img-responsive" style="width: 360px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Power and Lupino shaking hands behind microphone, Lupino holding sheaf of papers" title="Power and Lupino shaking hands behind microphone, Lupino holding sheaf of papers" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202b75198d4a3200c-400wi" /></a>This is a story inspired by one press photo of Tyrone Power and Ida Lupino standing at an NBC radio microphone, taken in February, 1939.</p>

<p>The year 1939 is frequently mentioned as the best ever for Hollywood films, with legendary films such as <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, along with many other classics, released. That same year, Tyrone Power and Jeannette MacDonald were voted "King and Queen of the Movies" by readers of syndicated columnist Ed Sullivan's column. For Power, it had been a quick rise to movie superstardom over the previous three years at 20th Century-Fox. </p>

<p>At the same time, radio, despite being a relatively new entertainment medium, had become huge business with gigantic audiences. Hollywood jumped aboard by the second half to the 1930s and was eagerly exposing its stars over the airwaves to publicize their own productions. In that vein, Tyrone Power was given his own radio program in late 1937: Hollywood Playhouse. The show was a 30-minute dramatic anthology series, airing Sunday night at 9 P.M. Eastern time on NBC, and sponsored by Woodbury Soap. </p>

<p>In early 1939, though, Power abruptly left the program.  The press caption on this Feb. 5 photo of Power with his last guest star, Ida Lupino, said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Movie King Says Farewell to Radio </p>
  
  <p>"Hollywood, Calif. — Sacrificing approximately $5000 per week for his work on radio programs, movie king Tyrone Power yesterday said goodbye to the radio because theater managers complained that his programs on the air were drawing crowds from the moving pictures. Ty’s boss, Darryl Zanuck, vice president of 20th Century-Fox, complied with requests of the theater men by convincing the film king to confine his activities to the screen.</p>
  
  <p>"Photo shows Tyrone Power and actress Ida Lupino at the Hollywood NBC studio yesterday when Power made his last appearance on the air for the Woodbury Co."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Power's departure was announced only four days before his final appearance. At that time, some press reports suggested it was the first sign that Hollywood was about to sever its relationship with the radio industry. A couple of the more sensational headlines: "Tyrone Off Air in Screen War Against Radio" (New York Daily News, Feb. 2, 1939) and "Finish War Looms Between Movie Industry and Radio Business" (Stockton Daily Evening Record, Feb. 2, 1939).</p>

<p>Zanuck's quotes in these and other articles at the time certainly fed the impression of a looming battle. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"We have no quarrel with radio, but there is great validity in the insistence of theater exhibitors who contend they are being severely injured because the airlanes are so crowded with screen personalities.</p>
  
  <p>"Not only the theaters but the stars themselves are endangered because it is so difficult to get adequate material for these air programs, especially when they must present something new every week. Film companies spend thousands of dollars and months of time preparing for the single appearance on the screen of any one of their stars. By its very nature, radio cannot exercise such care for the protection of a player. </p>
  
  <p>"The screen and radio can continue to help each other when they cooperate for mutual benefit, but the situation today is such that unless stern measures are taken both must suffer." (United Press, Feb. 1, 1939)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite this statement, most entertainment reporters and columnists remained skeptical about any substantial change in cooperation between the two industries. The same article that quoted Zanuck above quickly mentioned that the Power's fellow 20th Century-Fox star Don Ameche would continue his Sunday night radio appearances on the Chase &amp; Sanborn Hour.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Power, while far outranking Ameche as a box office draw, has played a poor second fiddle to his colleague among radio audiences. Power's program, according to the latest Crosley rating, is 15.1, while Ameche, [Edgar] Bergen and company are rated at 46."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Associated Press wrote that "little support was forthcoming elsewhere in Hollywood for the 20th Century-Fox head's opinion that radio hurts movie actors at the box office." Anonymous quotes from radio people poked at Zanuck, pointing out that "Mr. Power's radio rating has never been particularly high," and contradicting Zanuck's story by claiming that "Mr. Power quit the program in an argument over an introduction of a commercial announcement between acts of his play." (Buffalo News, Feb. 2, 1939)</p>

<p>The day after Power's final program aired, radio columnist Hugh Doddridge added some details to this last claim.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"During rehearsals for his broadcast of January 29, Power got into quite a beef with the agency producer over the policy of handling 'commercials'. Power served notice that should the sponsor continue to demand that the broadcast be broken up in the middle with an announcement, he would quit. The commercial announcement, nevertheless, was spotted as usual. Power, in quite a huff, called it quits!" (Highland Park News-Herald, Feb. 6, 1939)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doddridge added that Zanuck took advantage of this dispute for publicity. The sure sign that nothing would change between Hollywood and radio was that the replacement for Power would be fellow movie star Charles Boyer. </p>

<p>As for Power's final appearance on Hollywood Playhouse, where the photograph that started this story was taken, New York Daily News columnist Ben Gross wrote: "Tyrone Power and Ida Lupino appeared in a very conventional and mechanical skit, 'And Ensuing Complications'. It isn't surprising that Zanuck has ordered Ty off the air, if juvenile stuff like this is the best material available."</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we cannot listen to this show and decide about its quality for ourselves. According to Wikipedia and its sources, no broadcasts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Playhouse">Hollywood Playhouse</a> during Power's tenure are known to exist in radio collections. </p>

<p>Zanuck did not keep Tyrone Power off the air for very long. One show that is still available is Power's appearance on The Screen Guild Theater on Jan. 7, 1940, less than year after the incidents just described. He played alongside Humphrey Bogart and Joan Bennett in an adaptation of <em>The Petrified Forest</em>.

To celebrate the memory of dear departed classic film champion and <a href="https://www.caftanwoman.com/">blogger</a> Patricia Nolan-Hall, for <a href="https://www.ladyevesreellife.com/2022/05/the-caftan-woman-blogathon.html">"The Caftan Woman Blogathon"</a>, I am covering a time in the life and career of Ida Lupino that Paddy had touched upon in her writing a few years ago. </p>

<p>Paddy contributed an article to the collection of essays <a href="https://medium.com/cinesuffragette/the-ida-lupino-files-76530b1d243c"><em>The Ida Lupino Files</em></a> entitled <em>Ida Lupino Directs The Fugitive And Creates Classic Television</em>. Lupino directed three episodes of that television show, all in its first season—1963-'64. In her essay, Paddy summarizes these episodes for those of us not familiar with them. My essay will cover events in Lupino's life in the months prior to and after working on <em>The Fugitive</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>At the time Lupino directed <em>The Fugitive</em>, she was in her mid-40s and at the height of the television-directing episode of her career.  Television director was one of several incarnations Lupino went through during her nearly five decade in show business, including roles as actress, composer, writer, producer, and motion picture director. Over three decades earlier, Lupino had begun her film career in her native England at the age of fourteen, with lead roles in six films. Within a year, she was discovered by Hollywood, signed to a multi-year contract and moved across the Atlantic. Her acting career had ups and downs in the 1930s, but by the early 1940s she had become a big name thanks to her roles in films like <em>The Light That Failed</em>, <em>They Drive By Night</em>, and <em>High Sierra</em>. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://www.ladyevesreellife.com/2022/05/the-caftan-woman-blogathon.html"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e154187f200b img-responsive" alt="Caftan Woman Blogathon 2022" title="Caftan Woman Blogathon 2022" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e154187f200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>For the next decade, she was a full-fledged movie star. Yet, as reporter Peter Bart described her later, she "was a movie star who hated stardom, a glamour queen who loathed glamour". Near the end of the 1940s, Lupino decided to shift away from acting towards the work she found more interesting. She started her own production company in partnership with then-husband Collier Young. She co-wrote and co-produced several successful low-budget pictures—and became the only woman director in Hollywood at the time.</p>

<p>By 1954, the popularity of television was revolutionizing the film industry. Lupino's company, <em>The Filmakers</em>, was a victim of the changing times. She then moved into television acting and writing, with occasional film roles added in. By the late 1950s, she and new husband Howard Duff had created a sitcom that they starred in, <em>Mr. Adams and Eve</em>, which had a brief run of popularity. The show was cancelled in 1958 after two seasons, and Lupino, now 40, decided again to move behind the scenes. She started directing television shows in late 1958 with <em>Have Gun, Will Travel</em> and soon became in-demand. She virtually gave up acting—aside from infrequent guest appearances on television.</p>

<p><strong>1963-1964</strong></p>

<p>This brings us to the year when Lupino became involved with <em>The Fugitive</em>, nearly five years into her television directing career.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1541943200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1541943200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino with Gary Clarke on The Virginian episode 'A Distant Fury', 1963" title="Ida Lupino with Gary Clarke on The Virginian episode 'A Distant Fury', 1963" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1541943200b-250wi" /></a>Lupino began 1963 with work as both actor and director on <em>Sam Benedict</em>, a detective show starring Edmond O'Brien. O'Brien had worked with Lupino in her days as a movie producer-director, starring in two of her films a decade earlier—<em>The Hitch-Hiker</em> and <em>The Bigamist</em>. Now, Lupino acted with him on his television show as a guest star, and directed two other episodes. Also in the early months of 1963, Lupino directed two episodes of <em>The Untouchables</em>, plus appeared as a guest star on an episode of <em>The Virginian</em>. </p>

<p>Both of Lupino's guest acting appearances in early 1963 were alongside her husband, Howard Duff, who she frequently tried to work with. She and Duff had been married in late 1951 immediately after Lupino had obtained a divorce from Collier Young. Lupino gave birth to their daughter in the spring of 1952. By the next year, the Lupino-Duff marriage was in trouble—very public trouble. They had several prolonged separations that were much discussed in the press. With each one, divorce seemed more likely. Yet each time they reconciled—to the amazement of their friends.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278807b8705200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20278807b8705200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino with daughter Bridget and husband Howard Duff in 1955, during filming of the film 'While the City Sleeps'" title="Ida Lupino with daughter Bridget and husband Howard Duff in 1955, during filming of the film 'While the City Sleeps'" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278807b8705200d-250wi" /></a>By 1955, with their tempestuous relationship inspiring the theme of the sitcom they were then developing, the Lupino-Duff marriage appears to have stabilized. But once <em>Mr. Adams and Eve</em> was in the past, their troubles occasionally returned. The 1963-'64 period appears to have been relatively calm, as there were no indications in the press of any personal troubles between them, and the two appeared together on television frequently. For instance, aside from their acting appearances mentioned above, they were both guests of new host Johnny Carson on the <em>Tonight Show</em> in May, 1963.  </p>

<p>Lupino and Duff also were business partners, with Lupino trying to replicate the success she had had as an independent producer with Collier Young and <em>The Filmakers</em> from 1949 to 1954. In late 1961, she and Duff formed Stanley Productions—named after her late father—to produce a thriller they had purchased entitled <em>The Plotters</em>. By May, 1963, this project was still in development, but clearly Lupino was pushing hard. An article in the Philadelphia Daily News quotes her:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My husband and I are now planning to make some films in the next couple of years. 
  We are highly encouraged by the fact that the money men and producers seem to want to keep production here in the United States and are willing to put up money for low-budget pictures.</p>
  
  <p>The story is the thing.
  About a year ago we bought a couple of books, including one called "The Plotters", which we hope to get into production next month. </p>
  
  <p>Our company is a combination of a friend of ours named Fred Hamilton, who used to be a production executive at NBC, my husband, and me. 
  They are the president and vice-president, in reverse order, and I’m treasurer.
  We call the company Stanley Productions, after my father. 
  I’ll direct some of these pictures... but I’ll keep a hand in all the rest of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The setup that Lupino sketches here sounds virtually identical to that for <em>The Filmakers</em> from a decade prior. With her earlier company, Lupino similarly had two business partners—with one her husband—plus she directed some films and kept a hand in "all the rest".</p>

<p>At this same time, Louella Parsons wrote that Lupino and Duff aimed to launch a "full-scale production program of two movie scripts and three TV pilots", while simultaneously writing a children's book.</p>

<p>Alas, while Lupino discussed Stanley Productions into at least 1966 and pursued similar projects well into the 1970s, no new productions by Lupino ever materialized. It's not clear from the public record why her aim to again independently produce and direct films was stymied. Perhaps a hint is that, a few years later, Lupino wrote an essay (<em>Me, Mother Directress</em>) where she mentioned having turned down good opportunities to direct films because they would have to be produced overseas and she did not want to spend months away from her husband and daughter.</p>

<p>So with Stanley Productions unable to move forward, Lupino maintained her directing career with work in television. In late April, 1963, shortly before her <em>Tonight Show</em> appearance, Lupino signed to direct several episodes of the new series <em>The Fugitive</em> that would air on ABC-TV in the fall. Also for the 1963-'64 season, she signed to direct episodes of <em>Mr. Novak</em>, <em>The Breaking Point</em>, <em>Dr. Kildare</em>, <em>Kraft Suspense Theater</em>, and <em>The Twilight Zone</em>. This last one, where she directed the episode titled <em>The Masks</em>, is one of her most often cited and most well-regarded directorial efforts today. She also continued her writing, and, in collaboration with her younger cousin, Richard Lupino, sold a script to Alfred Hitchcock for his television show.</p>

<p>In addition to her busy directorial schedule and behind-the-scenes efforts on Stanley Productions, Lupino continued to dabble in acting, despite some possible insecurities about aging. Columnist Sidney Skolsky quoted her in August: "I’ve never gone through that frightening period of having been a glamor girl. To be a glamor girl and then lose your looks must mean a painful emotional transition."</p>

<p>Lupino was one of several celebrity guest stars, including husband Duff, who had small roles in an episode of <em>Burke's Law</em> aired on November 8, 1963. And she had a co-starring role in an episode of Kraft Suspense Theater, <em>One Step Down</em>, with Gena Rowlands and Leslie Nielsen, that aired the next week. </p>

A few days after that, November 19, the first of the episodes she directed for <em>The Fugitive</em> aired—<em>Fatso</em>. Two weeks later, with President Kennedy's assassination happening in the interim, her second directed episode of <em>The Fugitive</em> was shown—<em>Glass Tightrope</em>. Six weeks after that, her third and final one, <em>The Garden House</em>, aired on January 14, 1964.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202942fa94124200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202942fa94124200c img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="The Twilight Zone, The Masks, 1964" title="The Twilight Zone, The Masks, 1964" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202942fa94124200c-250wi" /></a>Lupino's now most famous television directing effort—<em>The Masks</em> for <em>The Twilight Zone</em>—aired on March 30 to virtually no press notice. While that episode receives a lot of attention today, Lupino herself appears to have thought her work that season on <em>The Fugitive</em> and <em>Mr. Novak</em> was most worthy of recognition. The New York Daily News reported in September, 1963 that her ambition was to win an Emmy award for either of those shows.  Furthermore, in an interview a decade later (published in <em>People Will Talk</em> by John Kobal), Lupino mentioned her work on <em>The Fugitive</em>, <em>Mr. Novak</em> and <em>The Untouchables</em> as work she especially enjoyed. </p>

<p>An anecdote published in July 1964, said that Lupino "will go to any lengths to get the effect she wants. She was directing a show that called for a breath-taking drive down a steep mountain road. With a stuntman doing the driving, Ida climbed into the back seat with a cameraman and gave running directions to both men during the hazardous drive. The brass at the studio, which objected strenuously to Ida's taking such an active part, breathed a sigh of relief when everyone came out unscathed."</p>

<p>After November, 1963, Lupino had no further acting appearance on television that season. But she did appear with her husband on the evening premiere of the game show <em>You Don't Say</em> on Jan. 7, 1964. She and Duff also appeared on another game show the next July called <em>The Celebrity Game</em>.</p>

<p>As the 1964-'65 television season opened, Lupino's work on <em>The Fugitive</em> was in the past—but new projects beckoned. She acted and directed on <em>The Rogues</em>, a well-received comedy caper show starring Lupino's old acting colleagues David Niven, Charles Boyer and Gig Young and produced by her ex-husband Collier Young. She directed some comedy shows with <em>Gilligan's Island</em> and <em>Bewitched</em>—and more.</p>

<p>But the biggest project, finally getting underway early in 1965, was to become the first feature film she had directed in over a decade, plus her first and only feature film that she directed for a major studio—the movie initially known as <em>Mother Superior</em> and later released as <em>The Trouble With Angels</em>, starring Rosalind Russell and Haley Mills. That, of course, marked the beginning of yet another episode in Ida Lupino's storied career and is a tale for another day.</p>

                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1264d34200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1264d34200b img-responsive" alt="High Sierra poster" title="High Sierra poster" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1264d34200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>
The 1941 Warner Brothers film <em>High Sierra</em> was a landmark in the careers of its stars, Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart—marking a transition from years of frustration to full-fledged stardom for both. <em>High Sierra</em> provided the first starring role for Bogart in a prestige project, and it was Lupino's first lead after her attention-getting supporting performance in <em>They Drive By Night</em>. Various sources relate different stories of the working relationship of the two new stars during this classic movie's production. Depending on what you read, you can get the impression that the two were close to lovers or that they throughly detested each other. </p>

<p>The feud stories were predominant in the period right before and after the film was released. For instance, shortly before the opening, an item in a nationally-syndicated gossip column claimed that Bogart and Lupino never spoke on set except in their scenes together. Several months later, a preeminent movie magazine headlined the Lupino-Bogart relationship in an article titled "Who Hates Whom in Hollywood"—saying "The Lupino-Bogart feud is one of Hollywood's liveliest." </p>

<p>Modern sources, however, frequently discount any feud based on observations from others working on the set. Film historian Eddie Muller claimed in a 2019 segment on  TCM that the rumors Lupino and Bogart did not get along during <em>High Sierra</em> were "nonsense". The thoroughly-researched biography of Bogart by Ann Sperber and Eric Lax reports that "no one connected with <em>High Sierra</em> saw anything to suggest animosity between Bogart and Lupino; all the evidence is to the contrary." </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1264e22200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1264e22200b img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino, Mayo Methot, Humphrey Bogart and Irving Rapper on location for High Sierra (Alamy stock photo)" title="Ida Lupino, Mayo Methot, Humphrey Bogart and Irving Rapper on location for High Sierra (Alamy stock photo)" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1264e22200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Irving Rapper, dialogue director on <em>High Sierra</em>, provided key evidence used by Sperber-Lax and others to counteract the alleged feud. In a later interview, Rapper stated that "Bogie was crazy about Ida", and that "Ida was in love with [Bogart]". Lupino's and Bogart's respective spouses, actor Louis Hayward and actress Mayo Methot, visited the set frequently, and according to Rapper, "[Lupino] was evidently too charming. Mayo Methot was jealous." </p>

<p>Lupino was always effusive in her remembrances of Bogart, who died in 1957. For instance, she contributed an endearing tribute, including a story from their work together on <em>High Sierra</em>, as part of the 1967 television documentary <em>Bogart</em>. Lupino said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find it very hard to cry in front of a whole crew. 
  Especially when they'd say, 'Quiet, everybody, quiet!' 
  I'd freeze up. I couldn't do anything.</p>
  
  <p>So, Bogey sensed this. This was the side of this man—this tough guy—that, you know, his friends knew. But I didn't know. </p>
  
  <p>He took me to one side and looked at our director, Raoul Walsh, and gave him a sign, and he said, 'Listen, doll. If you can't cry, just remember one thing—I'm going to take the picture away from you.' 
  Oh, I started to laugh. And I said, 'Now listen, Bogey, I can't cry. Don't break me up.' 
  He said, 'All right, you're relaxed.' And I said, 'Yes, I am, but now I can't cry.' 
  He said, 'All right, next step. Come on.' He walked me further away. </p>
  
  <p>And he said, 'Just try to think of one thing. If you can't relate it to me or the character—my character, right now—go back to your childhood. Can you remember when you had to say goodbye to somebody—somebody you loved—and you thought you weren't going to see them again?' 
  And I said, 'yes'. </p>
  
  <p>And he said, 'Well think of that, baby, that of it!' </p>
  
  <p>And there were tears in his eyes. And before I knew it, I was crying!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a separate interview, Lupino said about Bogart that "It didn't turn out for us to be lovers. But we did care about each other. Being with him was absolutely heaven, and I guess he didn't think I was too bad."</p>

<p>In contrast to the claim in Sperber-Lax that "all the evidence [about a feud] is to the contrary", several notable pieces suggest the animosity rumors had some truth. First, shortly after the filming of <em>High Sierra</em>, Bogart repeatedly expressed the belief that Lupino had used her influence to prevent him from being cast with her again in <em>Out of the Fog</em>. Second, Sperber-Lax recount an interview Bogart gave three years later where he "allegedly acknowledged giving Lupino quite a verbal battering" during <em>High Sierra</em>. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e127a441200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e127a441200b img-responsive" alt="Opening pages of article The Truth About Myself by Ida Lupino, Screenland, Nov. 1945" title="Opening pages of article The Truth About Myself by Ida Lupino, Screenland, Nov. 1945" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e127a441200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Finally, a smoking gun came five years after the events. In 1945, Lupino herself wrote that she and Bogart did not speak for two years after <em>High Sierra</em>. This confession came in an article published in the November 1945 issue of Screenland magazine titled <em>The Truth About Myself, by Ida Lupino</em>. In the article, Lupino debunks numerous inaccuracies that had been related about her over the years. But with the <em>High Sierra</em> stories, she does the opposite:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to gossip, I have been involved in more feuds than any other Hollywood actress. Actually, I have had only one real feud. </p>
  
  <p>There are three kinds of Hollywood feuds—the real kind, the publicity type which is used to promote a picture, and the kind which isn't a feud at all but is just a slight misunderstanding which is blown up out of all proportion.</p>
  
  <p>I once had a real feud with Humphrey Bogart, when we were working on 'High Sierra'. 
  I have a way of kidding with a straight face; so has Bogey. 
  Neither of us recognized the trait in the other. 
  Each of us thought the other was being nasty, and we were both offended. 
  For a long time we would pass each other with our noses up in the air. 
  For two years we didn't speak. 
  Then one day I was working on a picture with Paul Henreid and we went over to the set where Bogey was working to wish his director, Curtis Bernhardt, good luck on his new picture. 
  Bogey had to look right at me and I at him. 
  We both began to laugh—and that broke the ice. Now we are very good friends. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seeing the contrasting stories from different sources over the years, I found it interesting to investigate how the Lupino-Bogart relationship was described in the press in real time.</p>

<p><em>High Sierra production</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278804de015200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20278804de015200d img-responsive" alt="Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino in a promotional still for High Sierra" title="Humphrey Bogart and Ida Lupino in a promotional still for High Sierra" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278804de015200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Ida Lupino was cast as a lead in <em>High Sierra</em> in early July, 1940. This came shortly after her excellent performance in <em>They Drive By Night</em>, her first film at Warner Brothers and the role that propelled her to major stardom. Paul Muni was slated for the male lead in <em>High Sierra</em> at the time. Within a week, though, Muni and Warner Brothers had broken up. The studio needed a new star—and Humphrey Bogart, who had been campaigning for the role, was the logical choice.</p>

<p>Lupino and Bogart had first met during the filming of <em>They Drive By Night</em> a couple months earlier. But they did not share many scenes together. So, according to Lupino, she "didn't get to know [Bogart] at the time." </p>

<p>Production on <em>High Sierra</em> began on August 5. The crew, led by director Raoul Walsh, initially travelled to the Arrowhead Springs resort in the mountains outside Los Angeles. Two weeks later they returned to Hollywood for studio setups. In mid-September, the company went on another location trip—this time to Lone Pine and the Sierra Nevada mountains. On September 19, they all returned to Hollywood, wrapping filming a week later.</p>

<p>In the initial press reports, there is no evidence of any problems between the film's two stars. A reporter for Photoplay magazine visited the set and found "real excitement":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here was the picture Paul Muni dropped his Warners contract rather than make. 
  Here was Bogey, as all Hollywood calls him, getting his first real starring role.
  And here was Miss Lupino, "the new sensation", as they told us, forgetting all about Ida's seven discouraging years already spent in flicker town.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60473200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60473200c img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino smiling, with Raoul Walsh and Humphrey Bogart behind the scenes of High Sierra" title="Ida Lupino smiling, with Raoul Walsh and Humphrey Bogart behind the scenes of High Sierra" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60473200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>In an August 28 column, Sheilah Graham related that while she was interviewing Ida Lupino on set, "Humphrey Bogart joins us. He is smiling and happy." The two stars  good-naturedly discussed the film together. Ironically, in this interview, Lupino was compelled to deny rumors that she and Ann Sheridan were feuding after their work in <em>They Drive By Night</em>: "It's utter nonsense. Ann Sheridan and I have been friends ever since she came here seven years ago. Ann's first picture was with me. We lived together for a year. I don't blame her for not liking her part in 'They Drive By Night,' but she's too real a person to let it upset our friendship."</p>

<p>One alleged feud was shot down; but another soon was born. The next day Jimmie Fidler wrote that Lupino and Bogart "are stepping on each other's toes". He included no details. This is the only published indication of any discord between Lupino and Bogart that I have been able to find that was reported during production.</p>

<p>A couple weeks later, during the Lone Pine location shoot in mid-September, something more significant may have happened to affect Lupino and Bogart's relationship. On September 29, a few days after filming completed, Louella Parsons wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm surprised to hear that there was plenty of temperament on the location of 'High Sierra', with most of the flare-ups between Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart. 
  Ida is such a level-headed little person and I've known Humphrey so long it is difficult to believe they had trouble to the point of the little Lupino threatening to walk out. 
  It's true that big success has come to both of them suddenly with the past year—but they're both real troupers who have never begrudged honors before. 
  Well, location trips are tough on everybody's nerves so maybe that was the reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few months later, Dorothy Kilgallen wrote that the "tiff" between Bogart and Lupino had started when the two and their spouses "shared a cottage... and stopped talking!"</p>

<p>Speculating on what may have precipitated a conflict, the Sperber-Lax book points out that, on September 18—the day before the company left Lone Pine—Warner Brothers executive producer Hal Wallis had decided to give Lupino top billing over Bogart. The next two days, studio records list Lupino as unable to work due to a rash or illness. Sperber-Lax then write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the absence of records no one knows whether Bogart took out his disappointment on Lupino or even if they had a direct confrontation. 
  He knew well enough that she had nothing to do with the decision, and she later insisted that "he never said a word about" the [billing] change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sperber-Lax also report that Lupino thought Bogart was unhappy "toward the finish".</p>

<p>Some in the press tried to discount the discord rumors, even at the time. A photo taken in August at Arrowhead Springs resort, in the early stages of filming, was captioned in Screenland magazine's December 1940 issue: "This pleasant picture of Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart, left, with Irving Rapper, dialogue director, while on location for 'High Sierra', makes us doubt the rumors that Ida and Bogey were tiffing because one was trying to steal scenes from the other."</p>

<p><em>Immediately after High Sierra</em></p>

<p>Whatever friction between Lupino and Bogart that developed on the set of <em>High Sierra</em> had fallout a few months later with the casting of <em>Out of the Fog</em> (which had the working title of <em>The Gentle People</em>). </p>

<p>Warners, sensing they had a hit on their hands with <em>High Sierra</em>, considered re-teaming its two stars. In the last few weeks of 1940,  while Lupino was working on <em>The Sea Wolf</em> with Edward G. Robinson and John Garfield, press items appeared suggesting that she and Bogart would do a picture titled <em>Highway 99</em>; other items paired them in <em>The Gentle People</em>. In December, Bogart was sent east to do a personal appearance tour with his wife in preparation for the opening of <em>High Sierra</em> a month later.</p>

<p>Bogart had not been notified of any new role. While on his New York trip, he sent a cable to Warners producer Henry Blanke asking if the "rumor" about <em>The Gentle People</em> was true, adding that it "seems like a good idea". Apparently the casting rumor was not true—at least not yet. James Cagney and George Raft were the studio's top choices, though both soon turned it down. Bogart continued his campaign for the role.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60538200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60538200c img-responsive" alt="Ad for High Sierra in Modern Screen magazine, February 1941" title="Ad for High Sierra in Modern Screen magazine, February 1941" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdef60538200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>With advance publicity for the late January opening of <em>High Sierra</em> kicking into gear, new press items relating to the rumored Bogart-Lupino discord appeared. On December 27, Jimmie Fidler wrote that Bogart, in his appearances in New York, "could hold audiences spellbound with reports of how 'beautifully' he and Ida Lupino got along during the filming of that picture." </p>

<p>Then on December 31, Paul Harrison published this sensationalized item: "Except on one occasion—when she told him plenty—Ida Lupino and Humphrey Bogart spoke to each other only in the dialog on 'High Sierra'."</p>

<p>After all the other stories from the set of <em>High Sierra</em>, this—coming several months after filming completed—is not believable. It is perhaps a press agent's idea of how to get attention for the new movie by building on the earlier rumors. This item was re-printed numerous times in the lead up to the movie's opening a few weeks later.</p>

<p><em>Casting controversy</em></p>

<p><em>The Gentle People</em>, released under the title <em>Out of the Fog</em>, was a high-profile Warner Brothers production based on a play by Irwin Shaw. Lupino was considered for a leading role as early as December, while, as we saw, Bogart was rumored for the male lead—an unsympathetic racketeer named Goff. </p>

<p>While Cagney and Raft had turned the Goff role down, Bogart was eager for it; and so was fellow Warner contractee John Garfield. In the latter half of January, while Bogart was pushing for a meeting with Jack Warner to discuss the role, several Hollywood columnists were printing that Lupino's husband, Louis Hayward, was a candidate as well—despite Hayward's not having a contract with Warners. One columnist even claimed that Hayward was being tested and that Lupino did the test with him. (Lupino and Hayward were definitely trying to find a vehicle to work together in at the time. Very soon, the couple would be cast together in <em>Ladies in Retirement</em> at Columbia, which was filmed in the early summer of 1941.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1265067200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1265067200b img-responsive" alt="Out of the Fog poster" title="Out of the Fog poster" src="../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e1265067200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>As of January 31, 1941, internal Warners documents had Bogart penciled in for the Goff role in <em>The Gentle People</em>. But in the press and in the internal memos of the Warner executives, John Garfield had emerged as the most likely candidate. Sheilah Graham wrote that Garfield "probably" had the role; while behind the scenes, producer Blanke told Jack Warner that casting Garfield would eliminate "the problem of convincing Lupino to play with Bogart". On February 4, Jack Warner cabled executive producer Hal Wallis that "Lupino refuses to play in picture with Bogart." On February 7, Garfield's casting as Goff became official. Bogart was soon assigned to <em>Manpower</em> with Marlene Dietrich and George Raft.</p>

<p>The internal Warners documents claiming Lupino did not want to work with Bogart were devoid of the usual detail, according to Sperber-Lax. They suggest that it is possible "the studio invented the slight as a means of not casting Bogart and shifting the onus onto Lupino". Lupino's memories support this interpretation. In an interview decades later, she vociferously denied that she refused to work with Bogart in <em>Out of the Fog</em>, saying, "Warners was absolutely lying, completely untrue, completely untrue." [Ida Lupino: Beyond the Camera]. At the time, though, Bogart believed that Lupino had pushed him out of the film.</p>

<p><em>Suspension</em></p>

<p>Bogart's unhappiness with losing the Goff role was compounded when George Raft asked for him to be removed from <em>Manpower</em>. As Bogart saw it, Ida Lupino and George Raft were casting movies at Warners now—at his expense. On top of that, he strongly disliked the next script Warners gave him—<em>Bad Men of Missouri</em>. In early April, he refused that role and the studio suspended him.</p>

<p>During the suspension, Bogart's displeasure made the papers. On April 13, Whitney Bolton, presenting himself as a personal friend of Bogart's, wrote an opinion column in the Philadelphia Inquirer describing hostility between Lupino and Bogart during <em>High Sierra</em>—"icy goings-on"—although "they never actually had words". Then he repeats the story that Lupino did not wish to work with Bogart again and lambasts her repeatedly (and Raft as well). A sample: "The best that can be deduced from all those triple plays is that Miss Lupino and Raft skitter away from having an actor in their pictures. It would be possible for Bogart to get in there and pitch and steal 'Gentle People' from Lupino. It would be even less trouble for him to steal it from George." </p>

<p>This is a long, mean-spirited essay and hard to take literally—though coming from a self-identified friend of Bogart, it is evidence of significant bad feelings. Since this made it into print, what kind of talk was going on in private? The two years that Lupino mentioned of her and Bogart not speaking become understandable. </p>

<p><em>Epilogue</em></p>

<p>A month or so later, Bogart's professional situation turned around drastically when Warners put him back on the payroll and cast him as the lead in <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>. On the set of that legendary film in June, Bogart repeated the idea that Lupino had kept him out of the earlier film: "I was up for the John Garfield part in 'Out of the Fog', but Ida Lupino didn't want me." The bad feelings remained. </p>

<p>Within a few years of <em>High Sierra</em>, as Lupino recounted in her 1945 article, she and Bogart had transformed from cool antagonists into solid friends. An example comes from late 1944: Hedda Hopper tells of Bogart, with Lauren Bacall accompanying him during the early stages of their highly-publicized romance, taking time off from <em>The Big Sleep</em> to visit Ida Lupino on the set of <em>Pillow to Post</em>. Numerous other anecdotes in various publications show Lupino and Bogart socializing during the mid and late 1940s. And, of course, Lupino's own words in 1945 relate that they were "very good friends". Finally, there are Lupino's remembrances of Bogart many years later:</p>

<p>"When he liked you and he believed in you, he was the most loyal, wonderful guy in the whole wide world."</p>
