A few weeks before filming of <em>Moontide</em> began in November, 1941, Ida was quoted saying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everyone has been hoping to get the lead opposite Gabin in his first picture. 
  It may be a little catty, but I'm very happy I got it. 
  <em>(Knoxville News-Sentinel, Oct. 5, 1941)</em> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>Moontide</em> project had been announced seven months earlier, in April 1941, but had been immediately put on hold to allow Gabin several months in which to learn sufficient English. So during that time, which actresses besides Ida were strongly considered for the role opposite Gabin? Here are the candidates I have heard. </p>

<p><strong>Joan Bennett</strong> </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Joan Bennett" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d img-responsive" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db221200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Joan Bennett" /></a>In a short film on the making of <em>Moontide</em>, produced in 2008 for the DVD release, well-known film historian and TCM personality Robert Osborne gives this information. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The leading lady of the film was actually supposed to be Joan Bennett, 
  who had a contract with 20th Century-Fox. But she got pregnant. 
  So what they did is they borrowed Ida Lupino from Warner Bros. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't have access to internal studio documents, but from publicly available information, I have not been able to corroborate any of this. Taking the items from Osborne's statement in reverse order: first, Lupino had a separate contract with 20th Century-Fox and so was not "borrowed". Second, Joan Bennett was making films almost continually throughout 1941. Any pregnancy she may have had did not interfere with the making of any of the other several films she did that year. Also note that her next child was born in mid-1943, a year-and-a-half after <em>Moontide</em> was in production. Finally, I have not found any mention of Bennett's name in connection with <em>Moontide</em> in those newspapers or trade papers whose archives are available online.</p>

<p>This does not, of course, preclude the possibility that Joan Bennett was the studio's initial choice internally. But the apparent factual problems with the rest of Osborne's statement make me skeptical of the claim that Bennett was ever the top choice. Hopefully I'll be able to find more conclusive evidence one way or the other at some point. </p>

<p><strong>Linda Darnell</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="float: right;"><img alt="Linda Darnell" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b img-responsive" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971765e200b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Linda Darnell" /></a><em>Moontide</em> was first announced in mid-April 1941, shortly after Jean Gabin arrived in Hollywood after escaping his French homeland, which had been conquered by the German army the previous summer. No other definitive cast members were mentioned in the announcement, but influential Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons offered this tidbit: "Don't say I told you—but Linda Darnell is the leading candidate for the femme role." </p>

<p>Darnell was 17 years old and still in high school in early 1941. Despite her youth, she had made a big splash over the previous two years at 20th Century—co-starring in several significant films with established star Tyrone Power, including <em>The Mark of Zorro</em> (1940) and <em>Blood and Sand</em> (1941). </p>

<p>Interestingly, after that initial hint from Louella Parsons, Darnell's name is never again mentioned in associate with <em>Moontide</em>—at least not in anything I have been able to find. But there was another possibility that may have paired Darnell with Gabin in his first Hollywood movie. </p>

<p>For a brief time in late May and early June, rumors hit the press that Gabin could be the star of fellow Frenchman Jean Renoir's first American film, <em>Swamp Water</em>. Darnell was lined up for the leading lady. By mid-June, however, this was shot down and <em>Moontide</em> was again first on tap for Gabin, with Ida Lupino mentioned as his co-star. Darnell was dropped from the <em>Swamp Water</em> cast. </p>

<p><strong>Ida Lupino</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Ida Lupino" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d img-responsive" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db25e200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Ida Lupino" /></a>After Louella Parsons' one-time mention of Linda Darnell in April, the next woman named for Gabin's co-star was Ida Lupino. On April 23, barely a week after <em>Moontide</em> was first announced, a brief item in the Los Angeles Times entitled "Gabin's Luck" said "Ida Lupino is reported scheduled to appear opposite Jean Gabin in 'Moontide', his first film for 20th Century-Fox, which is tabbed to start shooting in September." </p>

<p>So that's that, then. Ida had won the role almost immediately, even though the film was still many months away from shooting due to Gabin's need to perfect his English. If Linda Darnell or Joan Bennett or anyone else was considered, it was not for long and none of the competitors' press agents were able to get traction in print. Is that the end of the story? </p>

<p>Mostly, but not quite. Six months is an eternity in Hollywood. </p>

<p><strong>Ginger Rogers</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d-pi" style="float: right;"><img alt="Ginger Rogers" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d img-responsive" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be41db2b3200d-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" title="Ginger Rogers" /></a>On May 5, columnist Louella Parsons struck again, writing that Gabin, who was seen around town with Ginger Rogers frequently at this time, wanted Ginger for his co-star and was working on convincing her to take the role. Parsons mentions Ida Lupino as "also in the running". This was just a few months after Ginger Rogers had won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her work the previous year in <em>Kitty Foyle</em>. </p>

<p>Once again, Parsons' reporting led to nothing, as Ginger Rogers' name not does not appear again in connection with the <em>Moontide</em> role. Soon Gabin was seen all around town with Marlene Dietrich. </p>

<p><strong>Back to Ida Lupino</strong></p>

<p>By July 1941, still several months ahead of the scheduled production date, Ida Lupino appears to have been firmly established as Gabin's co-star—both their names are included when 20th Century-Fox hypes their next season's films. And while circumstances could certainly have changed after that point, they did not. </p>

<p>As we saw at the very beginning of this essay, in October, Ida, who was then in a months-long dispute with Warner Bros. over the roles they were assigning her, was publicly expressing her pleasure with the role 20th Century-Fox had given her. When filming of <em>Moontide</em> finally began in November, Ida Lupino was on the job. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b-pi"><img alt="Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin in Moontide" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b img-responsive" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e971781b200b-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin in Moontide" /></a></p></p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>While researching one of my favorite movies—<em>Moontide</em> (1942), starring Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino—I ran across an interesting series of ads for the film in the trade papers. This 20th Century-Fox campaign is extremely focused on hyping up Jean Gabin as a new attraction for the female audience. They were attempting to build him into a new Hollywood leading man—to the extent that virtually nothing else about the movie is mentioned, but the proper pronunciation of Gabin's name is.</p>

<p>Gabin had been a superstar in French films for a few years, but was virtually brand new to American audiences. He had fled his home near Paris in mid-1940, as the German army conquered France, eventually finding himself in Vichy France for a few months. His life and career prospects in Vichy were poor, as he refused to make Nazi propaganda films. At that point, he accepted one of the Hollywood offers that had been coming his way for a while, but which he had always refused before the war.</p>

<p>Gabin arrived in the U.S. in April 1941 knowing just a few words of English. 20th Century-Fox put him on a crash course for several months before at last setting about to make his first American film, <em>Moontide</em>—based on a novel by actor Willard Robertson—in November 1941. The film was ready for release the next spring, by which time, the U.S., too, was at war.</p>

<p>Here are a series of ads that appeared in Motion Picture Daily and Motion Picture Herald in the second half of April, 1942, leading up to the world premiere of <em>Moontide</em> at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City on April 29. The gallery below unfortunately crops each into a square, so be sure to click on each to see the full ad, or click on one on each row and use the arrow keys to navigate back-and-forth.</p>

<br/></p>

<p>Anyway, <em>Moontide</em> is an unusual and great movie, with excellent performances, and an unforgettable atmosphere. You should see it!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>While researching my essay on <a href="../../../2020/09/what-happened-to-elinor-norton-1934.html"><em>Elinor Norton</em></a> (1934), I came across a full page ad for Fox Film Corporation from the January 2, 1935 Los Angeles Times. This fascinating ad is a view into the last months of this major studio. </p>

<p>Just a few months later, Fox was taken over by upstart independent studio 20th Century, run by the legendary producer Darryl Zanuck. For nearly a century after that, 20th Century-Fox was one of the preeminent Hollywood studios. (Alas, 20th Century-Fox met its own demise just a couple years ago when Disney swallowed them up.)</p>

<p>Look the ad over carefully. Examine the planned 1935-36 productions of Fox Films. Note their stars. Note their featured players, directors, writer, producers, etc. If I knew more of their later history, that overhead view of their Movietone City campus would be equally fascinating.</p>

<p>Here is the full ad. Click on the image to bring up the full size version.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4160f6c200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4160f6c200d img-responsive" alt="Claire Trevor in Elinor Norton, Screenland, Jan. 1935" title="Claire Trevor in Elinor Norton, Screenland, Jan. 1935" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4160f6c200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>While browsing an old Hollywood fan magazine in this age of coronavirus quarantines and restricted travel, my eye caught a photograph of a spectacular mountain setting. This monochrome photograph showed a distant view of large mountains behind a lake. The foreground was framed by two massive tree trunks, with the small figure of a casually-dressed young woman leaning against one. A large caption in this December 1934 issue of <em>Screenland</em> said, "The Most Beautiful Still of the Month". A smaller caption revealed more: "Claire Trevor in 'Eleanor Norton'".</p>

<p>Claire Trevor—a known quantity for me—a star or top supporting actress of many well-known Hollywood films of the 1930s and 1940s, including John Ford's <em>Stagecoach</em> (1939) with John Wayne, <em>Murder My Sweet</em> (1944) opposite Dick Powell's hard-boiled detective Philip Marlowe, and John Huston's <em>Key Largo</em> (1948), with Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, and Edward G. Robinson.</p>

<p><em>Elinor Norton</em> was another matter. This was a film I had never heard of—and from a portion of Claire Trevor's career I knew nothing about. Her career prior to her brief, Oscar-nominated, performance in William Wyler's <em>Dead End</em> (1937) was a black hole to me. I immediately decided to find out more about this movie. </p>

<p>This turned into quite a hunt, as <em>Elinor Norton</em> is clearly the most now-obscure movie I have ever looked into. Using my quick, informative, go-to references of old Hollywood fan magazines and U.S. newspaper archives (which include TV listings), I found no clear evidence that this movie has had showings since the 1930s. The only references in later decades I found were in nostalgia articles discussing the 1930s, or in listings of all of Claire Trevor's movies upon her death in 2000. </p>

<p>I am curious if anyone under the age of 90 has seen this movie.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4160fa1200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4160fa1200d img-responsive" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Book cover, The State Vs Elinor Norton" title="Book cover, The State Vs Elinor Norton" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4160fa1200d-200wi" /></a>The story of the film <em>Elinor Norton</em> starts with the 1933 best-selling novel <em>The State vs. Elinor Norton</em>, by Mary Roberts Rinehart. In contrast to the film, the novel is not obscure these days. It can be purchased as an e-book at popular web sites, plus it has been re-published as a paperback as recently as 2001. </p>

<p>Fox Film Corporation promptly purchased the rights to Rinehart's successful book. This was Fox prior to the momentous merger with 20th Century studios—which happened the next year—creating 20th Century-Fox. Fox was still one of the major Hollywood studios of the era, but financially troubled. A substantial fraction of pre-merger Fox films are obscure these days as they have not been in wide distribution for decades. A devastating film vault fire in New Jersey in 1937 destroyed a large cache of early Fox film prints—particularly devastating for their old silent films. For a number of pre-merger Fox films that still exist, the best recent opportunities to see them have been at screenings at New York City's Museum of Modern Art.</p>

<p>As of May 1934, Fox was planning for established star Helen Twelvetrees to play the principal role in the film that was then titled the same as the novel, <em>The State vs. Elinor Norton</em>. Hamilton MacFadden was assigned to direct. The film would start after MacFadden and Twelvetrees finished <em>She Was a Lady</em>. By June, though, Twelvetrees' name was no longer attached to the Norton film, and the press reported that the role was up for grabs. The studio conducted over two hundred interviews and fifty screen tests before assigning the role to their 24-year-old contractee Claire Trevor in July.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e969dcf3200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e969dcf3200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Elinor Norton photo feature in Picture Play, Dec. 1934" title="Elinor Norton photo feature in Picture Play, Dec. 1934" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e969dcf3200b-250wi" /></a>Trevor had only been in Hollywood for a year. She was coming off an appearance as Shirley Temple's mother in <em>Baby Takes a Bow</em> (1934), one of the child superstar's earliest starring vehicles. <em>Elinor Norton</em>, produced by Sol Wurtzel's unit at Fox like all her previous films, would be her first starring role. (Wurtzel's unit generally handled lower-budget films.) The story called for three men to act as her various love interests. These roles were soon cast with Hugh Williams, Norman Foster, and Gilbert Roland. None of these were huge names, with Roland probably the most notable. </p>

<p>"This is the big chance," Trevor told a Brooklyn Daily Eagle columnist as filming got underway in early August. "Up till now I've always played hard-boiled gals and sob sisters and that type of woman. But this is my first chance to be a lady (sob sisters arise!). For the first time, too, I'm allowed to wear good clothes. I've got 22 changes of costume. Both the wardrobe mistress and I are going dizzy keeping track of them. But it's just grand."</p>

<p>In mid-August, the company travelled a few hundred miles north of Hollywood to the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains near Bridgeport, California. There, they filmed at Twin Lakes and the Hunewill Ranch. This was a repeat visit for director MacFadden, who had also filmed <em>She Was a Lady</em> in the Bridgeport area earlier in 1934. </p>

<p>Twin Lakes is clearly the location of the "Most Beautiful Still of the Month" that started this investigation. I found a modern-era photograph that shows a near identical mountain-and-lake profile.</p>

<p>By late August, the crew had returned to Fox's Western Avenue studio. Constance Bennett dropped by one day to watch her companion (and future husband) Gilbert Roland play a love scene with Claire Trevor.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e969dd3c200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e969dd3c200b img-responsive" style="width: 356px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Elinor Norton movie poster" title="Elinor Norton movie poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e969dd3c200b-400wi" /></a>As production wrapped up in September, Fox officially shortened the name of the film to <em>Elinor Norton</em> and signed Gilbert Roland to a long-term contract. In early October, Claire Trevor left for a brief vacation in New York. The official release date was set for November 9.</p>

<p>The first ads for movie showings of <em>Elinor Norton</em> appeared in small towns in mid-October, suggesting the release date had been moved up. The first reviews in the trade papers showed up on October 20. None of the ones that I have found were positive—or even neutral. The exhibitor ratings were equally dismal.</p>

<p>Here are some quotes from various of these reviews: "much unnecessary footage", "tepid as entertainment", "a tiresome and unpleasant drama", "stilted dialogue", "direction is uneven", "a jinx to a good cast", "no interest in the story",  "whatever interest might have been engendered has been nullified by the quality of the acting, direction and production", "it falls short of being interesting or entertaining". </p>

<p><em>Photoplay</em> magazine stated, "It is an unbelievably dull picture." The <em>Independent Exhibitors Film Bulletin</em> editorialized, "Would it not be an excellent boon to the movies if audiences more often gave the 'bird' to trash like this?"</p>

<p>Nonetheless, as the movie was being released, producer Wurtzel was reportedly so pleased with Claire Trevor's performance that she was allowed to keep her entire wardrobe from the film. As we heard above, that would have been a substantial gift! </p>

<p>After Trevor's New York vacation, she returned to Fox studios to begin work on <em>Dante's Inferno</em> with up-and-comer Spencer Tracy. Within a few months, Fox studios had merged with 20th Century to become 20th  Century-Fox. Daryl Zanuck took over and a new era began at the studio. Wurtzel and Trevor remained under the new management. Director MacFadden was released.</p>

<p>Claire Trevor's career grew as her first starring vehicle plunged into obscurity. In interviews given by Trevor over the next few years that I have found, <em>Elinor Norton</em> is not mentioned.</p>

<p>A nitrate print of <em>Elinor Norton</em> resides under the care of the UCLA Film and Television Archive. It is reportedly not in good condition.</p>

Its stars are now virtually forgotten. Ida Lupino, the third lead, is well-remembered—though primarily for her post-1940 acting career and as a groundbreaking woman director in Hollywood. Her stint at Paramount in the 1930s is neglected.</p>

<p>The story of the production of <em>Paris in Spring</em> begins in late 1934 as the teenage Ida Lupino was on a several-month vacation in her native London, taking time-off after an eventful first year in Hollywood. In November 1934, Paramount purchased an unproduced stage play called <em>Two on a Tower</em> as the second film vehicle for opera singer and actress Mary Ellis, who they were attempting to build into a movie star. </p>

<p>With Ellis in <em>Two on a Tower</em>, the studio aimed to replicate  Columbia's success with opera singer Grace Moore in <em>One Night of Love</em> (1934). Lewis Milestone (<em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> 1930, <em>The Front Page</em> 1931) was soon brought in as director. <em>Two on a Tower</em> was planned to be one of the studio's more prominent productions of 1935. </p>

<p>Initially, early-career Cary Grant was considered for the male lead. But Paramount decided to go in a different direction. Shortly after the year began, they signed Tullio Carminati for that role. He had starred opposite Grace Moore in <em>One Night of Love</em>, so this was another building block in replicating that success. Carminati understood he was a key part, as he held out for "plenty of money". Dorothy Parker was brought in to help write dialogue and lyrics for the film. (She did not end up in the final credits.)</p>

She was cast as the second female lead behind Ellis and Carminati. Her first three roles in Hollywood had all been leads, but those were less prestigious productions.</p>

<p>Ida was very young—she would turn 17 in early February. A veteran of prominent roles in several British films, she had signed with Paramount in the summer of 1933 and moved to Hollywood with her mother Connie. She was the most talked-about candidate in the highly-publicized search for the role of Alice in <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. Ida did not get the part, but the studio nonetheless decided to promote the young actress as an up-and-coming star. They cast her in leading roles in three films released in 1934.  Over the summer, Ida had a few scary weeks recovering from an attack of infantile paralysis—polio. The studio delayed production of her next film until she recovered. After that, Ida decided to take time off to visit her father and sister in England. The studio agreed to let her take a leave for a few months.</p>

<p>In mid-January 1935, Ida arrived back in the United States aboard the Olympic with her mother and younger sister Rita, with the press reporting that she would be starting work on <em>Two on a Tower</em> immediately on her arrival in Hollywood a few days later. When she did get back to Hollywood, she was widely reported saying, "Four months abroad impressed me with the fact that I am first a Southern Californian and second an English woman," and expressing a desire for American citizenship.</p>

<p>By late January, work on the picture was underway. New York Daily News columnist Sidney Skolsky visited the set and reported that Ida looked more beautiful than before her trip to England, was as excited as a movie fan to meet Mary Ellis, and somehow had lost her heavy English accent. Ida, already well-known for playing bad-girl roles, said, "It's funny, me getting such a goody, goody role." She also said, "I fell in love, really in love for the first time, while I was in London... And now I'm to get a chance to prove I'm an actress."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bde8e4535200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bde8e4535200c img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino and Tullio Carminati in the opening scene from Paris in Spring" title="Ida Lupino and Tullio Carminati in the opening scene from Paris in Spring" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bde8e4535200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The film was a musical comedy with several operetta-style songs—all sung by Mary Ellis, though Carminati chimes in with a few verses in one of them. The original name of <em>Two on a Tower</em> came from the opening scene, where Carminati rides to the top of the Eiffel Tower feigning a desire to leap off of it, as Ellis' character has rebuffed his marriage proposals. At the top, Carminati encounters Ida Lupino's character, who appears to be more seriously attempting the same thing. Their encounter is about as charming as a double-suicide meet-cute can be. Their suicide plans are called off in an embrace, and they commence scheming to win back their true loves. For me, this charming scene is the highlight of the movie. </p>

<p>Soon, the name <em>Two on a Tower</em> had been dropped in favor of the more generic, but presumably more salable, <em>Paris in Spring</em>. The elaborate sets used in the film for the nightclub and the massive French country house indicate that Paramount was not skimping on this production. Press reports said the set was one of the largest at the studio. An item in <em>Variety</em> in June said that of recent Paramount pictures, <em>Paris in Spring</em> had the highest production cost—$800,000.</p>

<p>Rumors of a potential romance between Ida and director Lewis Milestone hit the papers in February—they were seen together many nights at various night spots. Both denied anything more than friendship. Ida was reportedly also dating actor Richard Cromwell. On March 9, Louella Parsons published an item: "Cary Grant, the object of many women's attention, beauing Ida Lupino." </p>

<p>Ida's January comments about becoming more Californian than English must have caused a stir in her native country, as in March, she was doing damage control: "[Ida Lupino] feels extremely grateful for the opportunities afforded her in this country but would consider renouncing her rights as an Englishwoman in the same way most people would think of desertion from the army."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e960f5a0200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e960f5a0200b img-responsive" alt="Mary Ellis, promotional shot for Paris in Spring" title="Mary Ellis, promotional shot for Paris in Spring" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e960f5a0200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Shooting on <em>Paris in Spring</em> was completed in the last week of March. All three leads came through with gifts for the crew, which was unusual enough to merit press attention. Mary Ellis then sailed for England to appear in a play, planning to return to Paramount late in the year for another musical. Carminati gave Ida a small watch for "being a good little girl".</p>

<p>Around this same time, Ida started spending time with the famous  millionaire, film producer, and aviator, Howard Hughes. In early April, they were photographed in Palm Springs together, and by mid-April, Ida had to issue a denial of impending marriage: "We are very, very, VERY good friends, but that is all." Her dates with Hughes, all chaperoned by her mother according to Ida's later recollections, appear to have ceased not long after.</p>

<p>In early May, Ida was invited by Jackie Coogan, the child star of Charlie Chaplin's <em>The Kid</em> on a weekend outing but declined. The trip resulted in a horrendous automobile accident that killed four people in the car, including teenage actor Trent "Junior" Durkin, and severely injured Coogan, the only survivor.</p>

<p>After this tragedy, she was back working in her next pictures at Paramount: <em>Peter Ibbetson</em>, another supporting role in a prestigious production—this one starring Gary Cooper and Ann Harding; and <em>Smart Girl</em>, a comic-drama programmer where she was the lead.</p>

<p>The first public preview of <em>Paris in Spring</em> was held in San Bernardino on May 20. Ida and Lewis Milestone attended along with numerous other representatives from Paramount; Carminati and Ellis are not mentioned. (Of course Ellis was in England by this point.) The official release of the film was a week later, and it generally received favorable, though lukewarm, reviews. </p>

<p>The vast majority of reviewers' attention, almost all quite positive, was focused on Mary Ellis. Ida Lupino was not mentioned in depth by many. One reviewer for the New York Daily News, after a glowing discussion of Ellis, wrote: "Ida Lupino, who has obviously been to a new beauty parlor as well as to a new school of dramatics, where in the first she has acquired a superior pulchritude and in the second a bigger and better acting sense." A Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote that "It is Ida Lupino who offers the surprise performance, however. She plays with humor and charm and projects personality for the first time." (This seems overly harsh on Ida's earlier performances, especially in <em>Ready for Love</em> (1934) and her British films of 1933.) Modern Screen magazine wrote about the supporting players, "The lad [James Blakeley] can act. So can Ida Lupino." They added, "Ida Lupino's about as interesting a movie starlet as you'll find out there."</p>

<p>At the box office, the appeal of <em>Paris in Spring</em> appears to have been limited, though I haven't found any concrete evidence of how it performed. Despite the mixed-to-positive reviews, a handful of exhibitor comments in the <em>Motion Picture Herald</em> in the second half of 1935 are mostly negative. One of the harsher ones said, "Many of our patrons decided they did not care to visit 'Paris in Spring'". The film had started its descent into obscurity.</p>

<p>As for the players, Mary Ellis returned to Paramount later in 1935 and did only one more film there, <em>Fatal Lady</em> (1936). She continued her long career on the London stage afterwards. She lived to the age of 105, dying in 2003. Her autobiography, <em>Those Dancing Years</em>, was published in 1982. In the book, she refers to <em>Paris in Spring</em> as <em>Paris Love Song</em>, and says "working in it was one of the most enjoyable times I ever had".</p>

<p>Tullio Carminati did a substantial number of films in Europe over the rest his career. His subsequent Hollywood film appearances after <em>Paris in Spring</em> were rare, but he did have a supporting role in the well-known romantic comedy <em>Roman Holiday</em> in 1953.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino continued at Paramount for a few more years—growing  increasingly unsatisfied with the types of roles she was getting—before abruptly leaving the studio in late 1937. After a career crisis, she broke into stardom at Warner Bros. in 1940, spending most of the next decade as an acting star before transitioning to writing, producing, and directing films—and later television. </p>

<p>In Ida Lupino's brief memoir, edited and published posthumously by Mary Ann Anderson, there is no mention of <em>Paris in Spring</em>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b img-responsive" alt="Bogart.SperberLax.Cover" title="Bogart.SperberLax.Cover" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e95c7d0c200b-120wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>A few weeks ago I started reading my first biography of Humphrey Bogart. This book was written by Ann Sperber and Eric Lax, published in the late '90s, and appears to be very thoroughly researched—especially regarding anything that happened at Warner Bros. So I was curious if they mentioned anything about the dog in <em>High Sierra</em> and his relationship to Bogart.</p>

<p>Given my <a href="../../../2020/05/pard-the-dog-frm-high-sierra-was-it-really-bogarts-dog.html">earlier research</a> that uncovered that Zero, the dog that played Pard, was not owned by Bogart at the time of filming <em>High Sierra</em>, I was not expecting to find anything in this thoroughly-documented biography. But, in fact, there actually is a mention of Zero in this book, and he is specified as Bogart's dog! </p>

<p>This was troubling to me. My research, based on contemporary newspaper articles, seemed highly unlikely to be outright incorrect. So I quickly turned to the end notes to try to find out the source for this brief mention.</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="display: inline;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d img-responsive" alt="ZeroBogartFootnote.SperberLax" title="ZeroBogartFootnote.SperberLax" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4085b12200d-500wi" /></a><br /></p>

<p>Ida Lupino!</p>

<p>That was certainly a surprise. She said this in a 1991 interview with author Ann Sperber, over 50 years after the filming of the movie. Given the time that had passed, and the lack of corroboration from sources of 1941, it seems clear this is a case of Lupino misremembering. </p>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="../../../2020/05/pard-the-dog-from-high-sierra-was-it-really-bogarts-dog.html">earlier post</a>, a newspaper story from 1941 had reported, second-hand, that Bogart sought (unsuccessfully) to purchase Zero the dog after the movie. If I may speculate, maybe that was true, maybe Bogart talked during the filming about a desire to own Zero, and maybe, over many decades, that became, in Lupino's mind, that Bogart actually owned Zero.</p>

<p>Due to the solid reputation of the Sperber-Lax biography of Bogart, could it be the original source of all the rumors about Bogart's ownership of Zero that have been repeated so often in internet writings and other sources over the last decade or so? I am inclined to believe so for the time being—pending further discoveries, of course.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Recently I uncovered some fascinating information on a forgotten aspect of Ida Lupino's multi-faceted career. Aside from her well-known contributions as a film and television actor, writer, producer, and director, she also co-authored a musical comedy that was <em>produced on stage</em> in 1949. </p>

<p>The stage production was the revelation, since it appears to have gone down a memory black hole. I have not seen such a production mentioned in any of the books and articles I have read about Ida over the last few years, even those by her biographers.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino had serious ambitions to write and produce a stage musical comedy, and she had worked quite a bit in that direction in the 1930s and '40s in her spare time. So it is pleasing to discover that this ambition of hers was realized, adding another item to long list of her show business accomplishments.</p>

<p>My presumption that none of Ida's stage musical works had been produced was based in part on <a href="https://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2014/03/27/apple-tree-farm-a-script-by-stanley-lupino-with-revisions-by-ida-lupino/">a 2014 article</a> by MoMA associate curator Anne Morra — an informative article about a script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> that MoMA had recently acquired. At the end, Morra relates that "<em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was never realized as a stage or screen musical". </p>

<p>From my own readings, I knew <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was the play that Ida was most determined to see produced. She had taken time off from acting and spent several months of 1946 — near the height of her Hollywood stardom — with the lofty ambition of getting it to Broadway. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-classic-hollywood-lupino-centennial-20180216-story.html" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20264e2dd9ce3200d img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Stanley and Ida Lupino in 1935 (LA Times)" title="Stanley and Ida Lupino in 1935 (LA Times)" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20264e2dd9ce3200d-450wi" /></a>This play was something she clearly cared deeply about. Ida's late father Stanley had written the original book, and there was no one Ida was more determined to please than him. Her attempt to adapt Stanley's book, write a score, and produce the play may have been a way to honor him after his early death in 1942. Morra mentions that Stanley's script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> was the only script that Ida retained to the end of her life. </p>

<p>Ida Lupino's push to make <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> a reality on the stage may have begun in 1943, the year after her father's death. Late that year, an item in <em>Photoplay</em> magazine relates, "Ida, by the way, is working hard on that musical comedy (she wrote all the music for it) she expects to stage very soon. Producer Lupino! Not bad." This item is consistent with <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>, though there is a chance it could be something else — she dabbled in music constantly at that time.</p>

<p>Events in Ida's personal life likely distracted her soon after that. Her husband, Louis Hayward, returned from the South Pacific a war hero, but devastated by his experiences. Helping him recover, then dealing with the break-up of their marriage in subsequent months took virtually all her energy. </p>

<p><em>Apple Tree Farm</em> doesn't re-emerge as a public priority for Ida until she was working on the film <em>Escape Me Never</em> with Errol Flynn in late 1945 and early '46. At that time, she energetically resumed work on the musical comedy. The press reported that she had written music and lyrics for five numbers and was aiming for it to be on Broadway in the fall.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino and Bill MacIlwinen work on Apple Tree Farm (Chicago Tribune, 1948)" title="Ida Lupino and Bill MacIlwinen work on Apple Tree Farm (Chicago Tribune, 1948)" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b89d5200b-450wi" /></a>Around this same time, she had invited several men and women to share her household due to the post-war housing shortage. One of these, a war veteran named Bill MacIlwinen, was a talented musician, and in him, Ida found a willing and able collaborator on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>.</p>

<p>In a March 9 column, Hedda Hopper wrote that Ida was taking a three-month leave-of-absence from making pictures at Warner Bros. in order to work on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. She would "adapt it for American audiences and to collaborate on the score with an ex-soldier". Ida planned to have a cast of "unknowns" and to do a tryout on the west coast before taking it to Broadway. </p>

<p>A week later, another Hollywood columnist said Ida was "working like mad" with Bill MacIlwinen. They were expecting to finish in late April, after which they would go to New York City to sell it to Broadway. Late in March, Louella Parsons wrote that "Warners have taken an option on Ida Lupino's musical, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>, for a movie. It's all ready for its Santa Barbara tryout." </p>

<p>Next, the Hollywood press reported that "Ida has signed radio comedian Jackson McCarthy to play in it," and that she and MacIlwinen had fourteen musical numbers written for the play. Singer Tony Martin was said to be ready to try out a couple of the songs on his radio show. (I would be fascinated to know if this actually happened.)</p>

<p>So as of April 1946, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> appeared to be on track for a production in Santa Barbara in the near future. Ida and Bill were proud of their work, as columnist Erskine Johnson discovered while vising the "Lupino Asylum", as Ida referred to her household, on "a rather dull afternoon", with only 10 or 12 people there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I want you to meet Bill MacIlwinen," Ida said. "He was a lieutenant in the Navy. Now we're collaborating on a Broadway musical — 'Apple Tree Farm'. Bill is writing the music, and I'm writing the lyrics. Listen! — he's playing the piano in the living room now."</p>
  
  <p>We listened. Bill was an excellent pianist.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>"You must hear some of our songs from 'Apple Tree Farm'," Ida said. We all rushed into the living room. Bill played and Ida sang.</p>
  
  <p>"My sister's husband is designing the hats for the show," Ida said, after singing four numbers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next on the agenda was Ida's New York sales trip, scheduled for May 7.</p>

<p>Then something happened — at the last minute, Ida Lupino postponed her trip. </p>

<p>The reported reason for the cancellation was a "serious throat ailment". Soon,  columnist Edwin Schallert expressed doubt that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> would go further any time soon, as Ida was going to be too busy with film work. One of the films Schallert mentioned for Ida never happened, while the other, <em>Deep Valley</em>, didn't end up going before the cameras for four months.</p>

<p>On June 4, columnist Harrison Carroll reported, "Ida Lupino will do a complete re-write on the book of her musical <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. She plans to publish several songs in the meantime." </p>

<p>At that point, at least in the press, <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> goes dark.</p>

<p>Six months later, by which time Ida Lupino was starring in <em>Deep Valley</em>, a United Press article about the madhouse of assorted people at Ida's home quotes her saying she is working on a musical for which "the play was written by my father." Signs of life? Or old news?</p>

<p>Another eighteen months — then, in April 1948, a Chicago Tribune layout on Ida includes an undated photograph of her working with Bill MacIlwinen on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. Again, is this signs of life or an old picture? </p>

<p>By late 1948, Ida had married Collier Young, and her household reverted to that of a traditional couple — no longer a motley assortment of people coming and going. Soon, she and Young would be writing and producing their own movies. The time for a stage production of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> had come and gone — or so I would have thought.</p>

<p>But then, on January 28, 1949, just a few days after Ida announced her plans to produce a film about unwed mothers for her independent company — the film that became <em>Not Wanted</em> and launched her celebrated directing career — an item appears in the Raleigh News and Observer with the headline "Ida Lupino's Play Will Be Presented":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chapel Hill, Jan. 27 — "Apple Tree Farm", an original play by Stanley and Ida Lupino of Hollywood, with music by Bill McIlwinnen [sic] of Fayetteville, will go into production next week on the University of North Carolina campus. </p>
  
  <p>The modern musical fantasy will be given here April 4, 5, 6, under the sponsorship of the Laboratory theatre of the Carolina Playmakers for the benefit of the Koch Memorial Fund.</p>
  
  <p>Martin Jacobs of Greensboro, who staged last year's first Memorial Fund show, "Sweep It Clean," will again be director.</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino, the famous movie star, has indicated she expects to attend the performance in Chapel Hill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Amazing news!</p>

<p>As I examined the newspaper archives from North Carolina as the April production date approached, I was concerned. Did this actually happen? Did something arise to prevent it?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b img-responsive" style="width: 420px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Apple Tree Farm rehearsal (Daily Tar Heel, Apr 6, 1949)" title="Apple Tree Farm rehearsal (Daily Tar Heel, Apr 6, 1949)" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e94b8a07200b-450wi" /></a>But nothing got in the way — it actually happened! The original planned run of three nights was extended to five: April 4-8, 1949.</p>

<p>Ida was unable to attend the performance due to her duties on her film, <em>Not Wanted</em>, which now included directing due to the illness of the assigned director, Elmer Clifton. She did do an interview on a CBS coast-to-coast broadcast the day before the premiere in North Carolina. And she and her friend Harry Mines sent telegrams of congratulations to the cast after the first night's performance. The reviews in the local newspapers were disappointed with the book, but enthusiastic about the music and songs. </p>

<p>Ida was not yet done with <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. At the time of the North Carolina production, she was reported to be planning a meeting with 20th Century-Fox about a script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. A few months later, when Ida was acting in the film <em>Woman in Hiding</em>, working with director Michael Gordon, this item appeared in papers: "Miss Lupino owns a property she'd like to see staged, and Gordon, a Broadway veteran, is, she sighs, the man to stage it." What else could that be but <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>? Ida clearly did not relinquish her Broadway dreams easily.</p>

<p>The next month, Ida told a North Carolina reporter that she'd like to visit the state in near future to visit friends, including Bill MacIlwinen. "I'm still quite elated over Bill's and my collaboration on the musical comedy, <em>The Apple Tree Farm,</em> which the Carolina Playmakers produced this spring. Maybe we'll do another."</p>

<p>And then <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> really does go dark — eventually falling into that memory black hole.</p>

<p>Morra's article suggests that Ida worked on a screenplay version in the 1950s. By that point, Ida was heavily into film producing, directing, and writing. As her Broadway initiative kept hitting dead ends, it makes sense that she would decide to produce it herself in the medium she was expert at and had some control over. She had so many other projects going, though, that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> does not seem to have gotten much attention at that point, even from her.</p>

<p>As the years passed, Ida Lupino retained the script of <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> — alone amongst the numerous ones that she had collaborated on through her decades in Hollywood. It was, after all, one her father had given her.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the classic 1941 film <em>High Sierra</em>, a small dog plays a critical part in the plot. This dog plays a stray named "Pard" that the lead character, a fugitive played by Humphrey Bogart, grows attached to and adopts. In the credits, the dog even gets billing: Pard was played by a dog named Zero.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e948b9c9200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e948b9c9200b img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="High-sierra-1941-humphrey-bogart-and-zero-the-dog-aka-pard" title="High-sierra-1941-humphrey-bogart-and-zero-the-dog-aka-pard" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e948b9c9200b-200wi" /></a>When reading modern articles about <em>High Sierra</em>, it is common to find asides asserting that Zero belonged to Humphrey Bogart in real life. This is certainly plausible, as Bogart and the dog appear to share a deep bond in the film, and there are a number of promotional shots from the movie showing Bogart playing with Zero. </p>

<p>References to Zero being Bogart's dog show up in some books. An example is <em>Crime Wave: The Filmgoer's Guide To the Great Crime Movies</em> (2006), by Howard Hughes: "Bogart's own dog Zero played Pard." Another is <em>The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies</em> (2011), by George Anastasia and Glen Macnow: "Pard is listed in the credits as Zero the Dog and was, in fact, Bogart's pet in real life." This bit of trivia has become so prevalent as to be nearly ubiquitous in mentions of the dog in <em>High Sierra</em> on social media platforms. </p>

<p>Even renowned experts on Hollywood history like TCM's Eddie Muller have promoted this bit of Hollywood trivia. In his outro to <em>High Sierra</em> from a <em>Noir Alley</em> showing in March 2019, Muller states, "The pooch who played Pard was actually Humphrey Bogart's dog, Zero. Just one more example of this film's spot-on casting."</p>

<p>But the reality appears to be different, as I stumbled across recently while reading old newspaper articles about the production of the movie. This Philadelphia Inquirer article from Jan. 31, 1941 provided the first revelation for me that Zero was not, in fact, Humphrey Bogart's dog. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263ec1a5aab200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263ec1a5aab200c img-responsive" alt="HighSierra.ZeroTheDog.PhiladelphiaInquirer.1941Jan31" title="HighSierra.ZeroTheDog.PhiladelphiaInquirer.1941Jan31" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263ec1a5aab200c-500wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a><br />
A shocker for me! Zero belonged to a "talent scout for dogs" named Rennie Renfro. </p>

<p>Other newspaper articles from that year describing the making of the movie discuss Zero, but none that I've found suggest any connection between Bogart and Zero outside of the film production. Plenty, however, mention Renfro's connection to Zero.</p>

<p>A little more research revealed that Renfro was not just any talent scout, but one of the largest suppliers of dog actors for Hollywood at the time, and for years before and after. His most famous dog was Daisy from the long-running Blondie series of films, but he trained and managed dozens more.</p>

<p>The dog Zero had acted in at least two movies prior to <em>High Sierra</em>: Samuel Goldwyn's <em>They Shall Have Music</em> (1939) with famous violinist Jascha Heifetz, and 20th Century-Fox's <em>Daytime Wife</em> (1939) with Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell. Some more research revealed a few films that Zero was in after <em>High Sierra</em>, including MGM's <em>Men of Boys Town</em> (1941) with Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney, and Warner Bros.'s <em>Sergeant York</em> (1941) with Gary Cooper. The last film I have so far found evidence of him in is a poverty row one starring Marjorie Reynolds called <em>Law of the Timber</em> (1941).</p>

<p>While Zero was clearly not Bogart's dog at the time of <em>High Sierra</em>, filmed in the fall of 1940, could Bogart have obtained Zero afterwards?</p>

<p>In fact, there was a story reported in 1941, told second-hand, that Bogart requested to purchase Zero for $600 only to be told by Renfro that the price had increased to $6000. I presume that put an end to Bogart's efforts to obtain Zero. </p>

<p>But of course plenty of this story remains hidden. What became of Zero after 1941? Was Zero in movies in 1942 that I haven't uncovered yet? Did Renfro retire Zero from films after his assistant, Zero's trainer Neil Gazeley, entered the Army in 1941, or for other reasons? If so, could Renfro have sold him to Bogart at that time?</p>

<p>I'm certainly curious of the answers to these, as well as to how and when the urban legend that Zero was Bogart's dog began. If anyone has more info, please let me know!</p>

<p>To close, there is a <em>Life</em> magazine profile of Bogart and his wife Mayo Methot from mid-1944 that contains a posed photo of them with their three dogs. This is three-and-a-half years after the filming of <em>High Sierra</em>. In case it is meaningful, none of the dogs look anything remotely like Zero.</p>
