It is the story of a year in her young life that saw her career fortunes tumble unexpectedly and precipitously.</p>

<p>At the beginning of 1937, Ida Lupino was one of the most talked-about young actresses in Hollywood and had just been awarded a contract extension and a raise from her home studio. Approaching her nineteenth birthday, it appeared she was on her way to the top.</p>

<p>At the end of 1937, Ida Lupino was out of work—with no contract and with no screen prospects.</p>

<p>How did this happen?</p>

<p>Lupino started that year as a Hollywood veteran of over three years and a lead actress of nearly four, including films she made in her native England  She was celebrated as an accomplished light comedienne, plus was gradually winning more acclaim as an actress.</p>

<p>She had been under contract to Paramount studios since mid-1933. They  had immediately put her into lead or prominent supporting roles in modestly-budgeted films, then had moved her into supporting roles in prestigious fare like the Gary Cooper-Ann Harding drama <em>Peter Ibbetson</em> and the Bing Crosby musical <em>Anything Goes</em>. </p>

<p>In 1936, she had the good fortune of Paramount loaning her to a new independent studio run by United Artists co-founder Mary Pickford and producer Jesse L. Lasky. There, Lupino made a big splash in two comedies: first as Francis Lederer's leading lady in <em>One Rainy Afternoon</em>; then, thanks to her strong showing in the first, as opera singer Nino Martini's in <em>The Gay Desperado</em>. Her performances in these well-publicized films, bracketing a juicy role in Paramount's own <em>Yours For The Asking</em> as a humorous crook, propelled her to a new level of stardom. She appeared to be on the verge of a major breakthrough.

Unfortunately, Paramount could not produce another good role for Lupino. A lead role in a forgettable football picture called <em>Rose Bowl</em> was her next assignment. An attack of tonsillitis spared her from from that role—probably for the best. In the last months of 1936, Paramount loaned Lupino out for two modestly better films, but still in innocuous leading lady parts: RKO's <em>Sea Devils</em> and Columbia's <em>Let's Get Married</em>. As Lupino was highly-sought after for such "ingenue" roles, Paramount exercised its option on Lupino's contract and gave her a raise from $1000 to $1750 per week.</p>

<p>"Ida was not the sort to be content with smooth sailing and comfortable checks. She had ambition," wrote Hedda Hopper a few years later. </p>

<p>So, at the end of 1936, Lupino was troubled. <em>Picture Play</em> magazine caught up with her in an anxious mood: "I've been fighting with every one at the studio, and I don't think my career is doing very well." She realized she was at a critical juncture. She had worked to put herself in a position to rise into the top tier of Hollywood actresses. Yet she could easily sink into a sea of undistinguishable starlets if Paramount continued to give her average parts in unmemorable movies.</p>

<p>On a brighter note, her hobby of composing music was taking off and earning her substantial publicity. Press reports suggested she was aiming to have thirty of her songs published. She also wrote chorus music for local stage performances. One piece of hers, variously referred to as "Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp" or "Aladin Suite", was performed and broadcast over the radio twice in February by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. Describing the Aladdin performance, the Los Angeles Times wrote that Lupino had "penned some most excellent music and lyrics."</p>

<p>By late March, both <em>Sea Devils</em> and <em>Let's Get Married</em> had been released to modest reviews—and garnered Lupino little attention. One reviewer of the latter described Lupino as "now at the peak of her screen career", but mentioned that was due to her 1936 Pickford-Lasky films.

In mid-April, Paramount cast Lupino in a movie on their own lot for the first time in almost a year. Jack Benny picked her to be his co-star in an elaborate musical production called <em>Artists and Models</em>. Lupino and Richard Arlen would play the romantic leads in a plot-thin farce that was essentially a variety show. Despite Lupino's music and dancing skills, she was not involved in any of the production numbers. The film is enjoyable and well-produced, but the limited role must not have been fulfilling. (<em>Artists and Models</em> notably marks the first of four times Lupino was directed by Raoul Walsh, who later became one of her mentors for her directing career.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e11b0f68200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20282e11b0f68200b img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Artists And Models (1937) poster" title="Artists And Models (1937) poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20282e11b0f68200b-300wi" /></a>As preparations began, a press item noted that Lupino had changed her hair color from blonde to "light brown, her natural color". One of Lupino's more memorable scenes in <em>Artists and Models</em> involved her falling into a swimming pool while wearing an extravagant evening gown. Columnist (and her close friend) Harry Mines reported her discomfort. "In practically everything I've done, I've taken a soaking," she said. "But I think this is the worst. The pool is so shallow I'm afraid I'll brain myself. I'd hate to be poor Dick [Arlen]. He has to dive in head-first." She added, "I know I have to do it. There's no way out."</p>

<p>Her composing hobby continued. In May, the BBC reportedly requested some of her songs to be played during the coronation of King George VI. In June, orchestra leader Andre Kostelanetz, also involved in <em>Artists and Models</em>, used one of Lupino's songs on his national radio program, which reportedly left her "agog".</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: left;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2027880429af0200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2027880429af0200d img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" alt="Fight For Your Lady (1937) poster" title="Fight For Your Lady (1937) poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2027880429af0200d-300wi" /></a>When <em>Artists and Models</em> concluded in late June, Paramount immediately shipped Lupino off to another studio, loaning her back to RKO for another innocuous leading lady role—this time in a Jack Oakie comedy, <em>Fight For Your Lady</em>. Lupino's romantic counterpart would be John Boles. In this movie, she finally had a chance to reveal some of her non-acting talents, playing a singing ventriloquist. She also has a solo dancing routine with a dummy in top-hat-and-tails, a la Fred Astaire. Alas, virtually none of her routine made the final cut, with the camera instead focused on Oakie and Boles mugging at each other in the audience.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, the press regularly commented on the long-term romance of Lupino with actor Louis Hayward—who she had been dating regularly since early in 1936. The press frequently suggested they were on the brink of marriage. In early August, Lupino was reported saying that she'd love to marry him, but "he hasn't asked me yet." The reason was that each wanted to get more professionally established first. </p>

<p>After <em>Fight For Your Lady</em> completed filming in August, Lupino's mentions in the press dropped off dramatically. No prospective projects were publicized. The most notable press item regarding her in this period was in late October when Louella Parsons and another columnist mentioned that Gary Cooper was using Lupino's dressing room after refusing Carole Lombard's because it was "too dainty".</p>

<p>This was the calm before the storm that was about to erupt. It would be fascinating to know what was going on behind the scenes between Lupino and Paramount in the fall of 1937.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdeeab8da200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdeeab8da200c img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Her Jungle Love (1938) poster" title="Her Jungle Love (1938) poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdeeab8da200c-250wi" /></a>The storm hit in mid-November. </p>

<p>"Ida Lupino walked out of Paramount a few days ago taking her contract with her," Louella Parsons reported on November 20. "Her grievance is <em>Jungle Lover</em>, in which she was asked to support Dorothy Lamour, who was just starting when Ida was playing leads. Playing second fiddle isn't the little Lupino's only annoyance, but her brief four pages of dialogue was the straw that really broke the camel's back." </p>

<p>Two very prominent New York columnists also mentioned the Lupino-Paramount blow-up. On November 22, Ed Sullivan wrote that "Ida Lupino could have got her Paramount release without stalking off the lot." On the 24th, Walter Winchell picked it up, saying "Ida Lupino walked out of <em>Her Jungle Love</em> rather than risk emoting in a pewy role. The contract she mutually agreed to tear up brought her $1,750 per!"</p>

<p>"Paramount had decided to get rid of me," Lupino told a reporter three years later. She added, "The studio handed me a part which was so brief it was an insult. I quit—and we were both happy." Paramount had a replacement officially named the next day—the inexperienced and then-unknown Dorothy Howe (later and better known as Virginia Vale)—indicating that they were not exactly surprised by Lupino's abrupt walkout.</p>

<p>Years afterward, after Lupino had reconstituted her career and reached new heights, she credited Hedda Hopper with encouraging this "rebellion". Hopper was still an actress and not yet a notorious gossip columnist. She and Lupino had become friendly on the set of <em>Artists and Models</em>, so Lupino asked Hopper's advice on how to break out of her rut of ingenue roles. Hopper encouraged her to change to a more natural look and to "go and think and study a bit about acting", as Lupino recalled. </p>

<p>Lupino told Hopper, “It’s now or never, if I’m going to get anywhere."</p>

<p>With her walkout, Lupino's four-year tenure at Paramount was suddenly over. Her substantial paycheck was gone. With an unremarkable series of roles over the previous year, would she be able to succeed as a free-lance actress? Nothing concrete was on the horizon.</p>

<p>Louella Parsons suggested Lupino's new plan was to return to her native England and make a picture with her father—well-known stage and screen comedian Stanley Lupino. She also had Louis Hayward to consider, who was intent on establishing himself in American movies. So to close out the year, Lupino remained in Hollywood, taking a radio gig in mid-December on Cecil B. DeMille's Lux Radio Theater, co-starring with Robert Montgomery in <em>The Thirty-Nine Steps</em>. The brief on-air chat after the drama did not mention any screen prospects for Lupino. Instead, they discussed her music hobby. "What's your latest composition?" DeMille asked. Lupino replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something I've just sent to London. 
  The score and book for a musical comedy. 
  Look, I hope no one is going to get the impression that I think I'm a great musician.
  In fact, I know so little that I often use a code to take the place of notes and musical symbols until I have time to figure out what I'm trying to do. 
  I use the letters of the alphabet for a code.
  If you ever saw one of my scores, you'd think someone had spilled alphabet soup on an orchestration sheet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, Lupino would not return to England to make pictures there, and she would not start work on another Hollywood film for another year. </p>

<p>As 1937 drew to a close, Lupino was entering her career wilderness phase—apparently washed up before her twentieth birthday. It was a challenging period for her, but it would set her up for the breakthrough that did happen in 1939. That is a story for another day.</p>

                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278802705d2200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20278802705d2200d img-responsive" alt="Road House (1948) poster" title="Road House (1948) poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278802705d2200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The film noir classic <em>Road House</em> (1948) contains one of Ida Lupino's most compelling performances in a career full of them. It was made at a crossroads of her life and career, when she was in the middle of an extended transition from leading actress to being a writer, producer, and director.</p>

<p>As part of the larger story of the making of this film, here is the story of how its cast was assembled. This tale brings together a number of interesting personalities in post-war Hollywood, several of whom were also at critical points in their respective careers.</p>

<p><em>Originator: Ida Lupino</em></p>

<p>In September, 1947, Ida Lupino herself initiated the project that became <em>Road House</em>. Early that year, Lupino had finished her long-term contract at Warner Brothers. Seeking creative control over her acting career, she rejected a new exclusive contract and instead chose to become an independent producer. In February, she formed Arcadia Productions with producer Benedict Bogeaus and took on the job of producer of her own movies, with an ambition to produce others as well. By late summer, however, she had nothing to show for her hard work. (See this <a href="../../../2021/02/never-again-the-story-of-ida-lupino-and-arcadia-productions.html">earlier article</a> for more on this episode in Lupino's career.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1b99200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1b99200c img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino in 'Road House'" title="Ida Lupino in 'Road House'" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1b99200c-250wi" /></a>Meanwhile, amongst the many scripts, stories, and books she had been poring over in search of good material, Lupino found a story called <em>The Dark Love</em>, by Margaret Gruen and Oscar Saul. She decided that this story should be her next project. At this time, prominent Hollywood agent Charles Feldman was attempting to win her services, and he and Ida worked out a deal where they purchased the story rights for $20,000 and then sold them to 20th Century-Fox with the condition that Lupino play the lead. Her salary would be $95,000, plus $15,000 profit on the story sale. Feldman waived his commissions and Lupino joined his agency.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this story deal happened at virtually the same time that Lupino dissolved Arcadia Productions. The first mention of Lupino's interest in <em>Dark Love</em> in the Hollywood press was on September 2, 1947 in a Hedda Hopper column. The very next day Sheilah Graham carried an item that "Ida Lupino and Benedict Bogeaus have called off their picture deal. They couldn't get together on story or price." Ten days after that, Louella Parsons broke the news that Lupino would be doing <em>The Dark Love</em>—already retitled <em>Road House</em>—at 20th Century-Fox. </p>

<p>Could the Lupino-Bogeaus breakup have been precipitated by <em>The Dark Love</em>? Why did Lupino not attempt to produce <em>The Dark Love</em> herself via Arcadia Productions as she had tried with other material? Here are some considerations: first, after seven months of unsuccessful attempts at producing other pictures, she was frustrated with that role; second, Feldman's deal was very lucrative for her and also provided her choice of story; third, she had a contractual obligation to 20th Century-Fox for one picture—an obligation that had been outstanding for several years. </p>

<p>So Lupino gave up her independent production efforts—temporarily, it turned out—and returned to acting at one of the large Hollywood studios. The fact that she had selected the story, though, was a major difference from her earlier career, when she was a contract player with little to no say in the material she was given.</p>

<p><em>Co-star Victor Mature?</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202788027070c200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202788027070c200d img-responsive" style="width: 160px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Victor Mature" title="Victor Mature" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202788027070c200d-200wi" /></a>The initial press reports for <em>Road House</em> in September mentioned Victor Mature as Lupino's leading man. Mature, a star at 20th Century-Fox for several years but long derided as an actor, was riding a wave of good notices for his performance in <em>Kiss of Death</em>—released the previous month. As Louella Parsons wrote in her item announcing the <em>Road House</em> role for Lupino, "I used to feel I could take or leave [Victor Mature] as an actor, but now I do not want to leave him, because he is that good." In mid-October, Hedda Hopper wrote that Mature was the "hottest star in town".</p>

<p><em>Road House</em> was originally slated to begin production in November. It would not actually start until late the next March. Press reports are not explicit about the reasons for the delays, but it is likely that finding a director and casting the two leading male roles contributed. Four directors turned down the project, according to William Donati in his Lupino biography. And while Lee J. Cobb was the initial name tossed around for the "heavy" role, according to film historian Eddie Muller in the 2008 DVD commentary, 20th Century-Fox studio chief Darryl Zanuck wanted hot newcomer Richard Widmark. Waiting for him to be available may thus have been another reason.</p>

<p>Victor Mature was still being mentioned in the press as Lupino's leading man as late as November 24. But that same month, other reports suggested that <em>The Chair for Martin Rome</em> (later released as <em>Cry of the City</em>) would be Mature's next film. Indeed, that film started production in late December and Mature was in the starring role. The identity of Lupino's co-star for <em>Road House</em> was still up in the air.</p>

<p>Lupino did not let the delays stop her from preparing. In late December, Sheilah Graham wrote that "most of the story takes place in a bowling alley. And that's where you'll find Ida these days and evenings—learning to bowl."</p>

<p><em>Academy-award candidate Celeste Holm</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2027880270664200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2027880270664200d img-responsive" style="width: 160px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Celeste Holm" title="Celeste Holm" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2027880270664200d-200wi" /></a>The next casting news did not come until January 26, 1948, when the press reported that Celeste Holm had "an important role in <em>Road House</em>". Holm was an ex-Broadway actor, most notable for originating the role of Ado Annie in the 1943 stage hit <em>Oklahoma</em>. In 1946, she signed a contract with 20th Century-Fox and did a couple  roles in relatively unnoticed musical films. By early 1948, however, she was receiving spectacular notices for her first dramatic role, in <em>Gentleman's Agreement</em>—including Academy Award talk as supporting actress. That film had been released just two months earlier in New York and Chicago and was still not released nationally.</p>

<p><em>Director Jean Negulesco</em></p>

<p>A director for <em>Road House</em> was finally found two weeks later. On February 11, Edwin Schallert of the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported that 20th Century-Fox had signed Jean Negulesco to helm the movie. Negulesco was coming off eight years at Warner Brothers—most recently directing <em>Johnny Belinda</em>. During production of that film, Jack Warner became annoyed that Negulesco was taking too many pictorial shots. Hedda Hopper described the aftermath in her January 29 column: "Jean Negulesco brought in <em>Johnny Belinda</em> for $1,300,000—nearly $250,000 under budget. Then 10 days before Christmas, has was laid off by Warners and hasn't worked since. If that's gratitude, we should find a new meaning for the word. I'm told by those who have seen it that <em>Belinda</em> is one of the most sensitive, beautiful and artistic pictures ever made." </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1c5d200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1c5d200c img-responsive" style="width: 160px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Jean Negulesco" title="Jean Negulesco" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdecf1c5d200c-200wi" /></a>Negulesco recalled, "After Warner gave me the sack, I was very sad and I thought of going back to painting and quit making films." Zanuck and 20th Century-Fox snapped up Negulesco in February and paid him $3000 a week, three times his previous salary. Negulesco told Hopper, "At the first producers' meeting, I thought I was being kidded when asked [by Zanuck], 'What can I do to make you happy? Just name it.'"</p>

<p>Lupino was no doubt pleased that Negulesco was on board. Her last film, <em>Deep Valley</em>, completed over a year earlier at Warner Brothers, was also directed by Negulesco. During that film, she was extremely happy working with Negulesco and his crew. She was reported saying that she wanted him to direct her next picture. She also stated that she would stay at Warners if they allowed her to choose her own directors. Her demands weren't met by Warners, yet Negulesco was indeed directing Lupino's next film—at 20th Century-Fox. Could Lupino have pulled strings with Zanuck behind the scenes? Interestingly, Negulesco recalls that Zanuck told him at their first meeting, "I've watched a film of yours that I liked a lot: <em>Deep Valley</em>."</p>

<p><em>Richard Widmark, aka 'Tommy Udo'</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9a1cedd200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9a1cedd200b img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo in 'Kiss of Death'" title="Richard Widmark as Tommy Udo in 'Kiss of Death'" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9a1cedd200b-300wi" /></a>In late February,  the two male leads were finalized, clearing the way for production to start within a few weeks. Hedda Hopper reported that Cornel Wilde and Richard Widmark would fill those roles. </p>

<p>Richard Widmark entered <em>Road House</em> on a career trajectory similar to Celeste Holm. He, too, was ex-Broadway actor and newcomer to Hollywood who was receiving huge plaudits for his most recently released film. Unlike Holm, Widmark's breakout had come in his very first film, <em>Kiss of Death</em>—the same film that raised Victor Mature's acting reputation in the late summer of 1947—where Widmark played the maniacal Tommy Udo, a character infamous for pushing a woman in a wheelchair down a flight of stairs. </p>

<p>Widmark was currently finishing up <em>The Street With No Name</em> as another murderer. In January, he had told Hedda Hopper, "This will be my last [such role]. I didn't come into pictures to be typed as a killer; I'm an actor—I hope." His transition away from psychopaths would take a bit longer, however, as his role in <em>Road House</em> would be similar.</p>

<p><em>Leading man Cornel Wilde</em></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278802706ea200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20278802706ea200d img-responsive" style="width: 160px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Cornel Wilde" title="Cornel Wilde" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20278802706ea200d-200wi" /></a>Cornel Wilde, Lupino's new leading man in <em>Road House</em>, was one of 20th Century-Fox's top stars of the previous few years. He had already been in two films with Lupino—both before he hit the big time. In <em>High Sierra</em> (1941) he had a small role, while in <em>Life Begins at Eight-Thirty</em> (1942), he had been Lupino's love interest, with the top male role filled by Monty Woolley. </p>

<p>Wilde's breakthrough came in 1945 with the role of Frederic Chopin in the biopic <em>A Song to Remember</em>, for which he earned an Academy Award nomination as best actor. His most recent project had been <em>The Walls of Jericho</em> at 20th Century-Fox, with Linda Darnell, Anne Baxter and Kirk Douglas. After that completed, he spent a lot of his energy—unsuccessfully—trying to find a suitable Broadway play for him and his wife Patricia Knight. </p>

<p>The marriage of Wilde and Knight was on the volatile side, apparently, and attracted a lot of attention by the Hollywood press. The previous summer, Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times, discussing a temporary break up, wrote that their relationship was "considered one of the most celebrated of love idylls In Hollywood history". Wilde had also gotten a reputation related to his attempted promotion of his wife's career. In November 1947, Louella Parsons wrote that Humphrey Bogart "doesn't want to be another Cornel Wilde and get himself disliked at the studio or criticized in the press because he keeps asking for his bride as his movie partner." Parsons reassured Bogart, "I don't think your case and the Cornel Wilde case are in the least comparable. Betty [Bogart's wife Lauren Bacall] has already made a success and I never heard of your trying to push her."</p>

<p><em>A glittering cast</em></p>

<p>So by late February, 1948, the <em>Road House</em> lineup was full of celebrated stars. Darryl Zanuck was clearly not holding back. With top-billed Ida Lupino was one of 20th Century-Fox's top male box office stars and two of the hottest new supporting players. Director Negulesco said of <em>Road House</em>: "It's the finest cast I've ever had."</p>

<p>As the cast was finalized, Widmark and Holm both received Academy Award nominations for their supporting roles in their most recent films: <em>Kiss of Death</em> and <em>Gentleman's Agreement</em>, respectively.  Director Negulesco also had just had a breakout, award-nominated performance of his own— <em>Johnny Belinda</em>—though the full impact of that awaited its release later in 1948. He would receive an Academy Award nomination for best director the next year. </p>

<p>On March 10, The Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave their Golden Globe award for best supporting actress to Celeste Holm and their award for best male newcomer to Richard Widmark. Then, on March 20—two days before <em>Road House</em> started production—Holm won the Academy Award, while Widmark lost out to Edmund Gwenn for <em>Miracle on 34th Street</em>. <em>Road House</em> was starting on a high note for its supporting cast.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the next edition, which will cover the making of the film and its aftermath for Lupino, Wilde, Widmark, Holm, and Negulesco.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the <a href="../../../2021/02/a-forgotten-chapter-in-ida-lupinos-career.html">first edition</a> of the story of Ida Lupino's little-discussed first venture into film production, we left off in early February 1947. Lupino had concluded her contract at Warner Brothers and promptly formed an independent production company, Arcadia Productions, in partnership with Benedict Bogeaus. In this arrangement, she was to produce and star in one film a year over three years. </p>

<p>The 1947 Bogeaus-Lupino alliance is described as a "hasty partnership" in Donati's biography of Lupino, but as we saw, Lupino had put much time and effort over several years behind the decision to produce her own vehicles and take more creative control over her career. Additionally, as reported in <em>Showmens Trade Review</em> the same month Arcadia was formed, Lupino intended to produce films in which she was <em>not</em> the star. Her production designs extended beyond picking her own roles.</p>

<p><strong>Beginnings of Arcadia Productions</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9933be0200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9933be0200b img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino to Make Debut As Producer, Los Angeles Times, Apr. 27, 1947" title="Ida Lupino to Make Debut As Producer, Los Angeles Times, Apr. 27, 1947" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9933be0200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>In the early weeks of Arcadia, Lupino was spending her time in the desert, in Palm Springs—recovering from spiral meningitis obtained during the grueling shoot of <em>Deep Valley</em>, her last film at Warners. During this period, she and Bogeaus were considering numerous possibilities for her first film as producer. </p>

<p>A comedy called <em>New Years' Eve</em> was mentioned as Lupino's first project in the Louella Parsons article where the formation of Arcadia was first reported. Within days, though, a period drama, <em>The Queen's Necklace</em> became the reported choice. This film had been announced as a Lupino acting vehicle when she first signed with Bogeaus a year before. Now, Brian Aherne was mentioned as her potential co-star. Then, in March, a drama called <em>Celia</em> by Arch Oboler was purchased by Bogeaus and also became a candidate for Lupino's first Arcadia project. Clearly nothing was set in stone. In mid-March, press reports suggested they were three months away from starting filming on whatever project was decided upon.</p>

<p>At this same time, Lupino was recruiting a certain Broadway actor as her leading man. A reporter for the Hollywood Evening Citizen News wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She won't reveal his name because 'it wouldn't be fair to him if nothing should come of it'. But she's compiled a complete dossier on the gent, full of clippings and pictures. And if he lives up to his press clippings, she expects to bring his signature back on a contract. </p>
  
  <p>The big search is being made for her independent film with Ben Bogeaus, which the actress will start shortly after returning from the East. In spite of her interest in the unnamed New York actor, she is constantly looking out for someone in Hollywood who might fit the bill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it's not clear to me whether she ever made this New York recruiting trip or not, this is an early appearance of Lupino's ambition to foster new talent. This desire was the driving motivation in her subsequent producing efforts, where she helped launch the film acting careers of Sally Forrest, Mala Powers, Keefe Brasselle, Hugh O'Brian and others.</p>

<p><strong><em>Early Autumn</em></strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e39200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e39200b img-responsive" style="width: 260px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Early Autumn book cover" title="Early Autumn book cover" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e39200b-300wi" /></a>By the beginning of April, Lupino's first Arcadia project was finalized. Bogeaus purchased <em>Early Autumn</em>, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Louis Bromfield. This drama would provide a dual acting role for Lupino, as a mother of 40 and a girl of 18.  </p>

<p>The pace of activity at Arcadia now picked up, with the signing of Frances Robinson—a good friend of Lupino's—as story editor, the hiring of Dewitt Bodeen to write the screenplay, and the pursuit of King Vidor to direct. The quest for a leading man also continued, with Lupino and Bogeaus ardently pursuing both Arthur Kennedy and Robert Preston. Lupino reportedly also considered her ex-husband Louis Hayward.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lupino helped her new business partner by giving a dinner party on the Bogeaus lot for a number of prominent press representatives, then giving a screening of Bogeaus' newest production, <em>The Macomber Affair</em>. </p>

<p>By late April, the press was reporting on Ida Lupino's "debut as producer", while also noting her high demand as a leading actress. Columnist Erskine Johnson quoted her saying, "Bill Cagney [James Cagney's producer brother] came to me the other day and wondered in Producer Lupino would loan him Actress Lupino for a role in <em>The Time of Your Life</em>." Johnson continued:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every agent in town is chasing her to hire their clients. She's just about ready to ask someone to proclaim a 'Be Kind to Producers Week'. And if all producers had such pretty legs, I'd proclaim it myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this activity at Arcadia on <em>Early Autumn</em> had been going on while Lupino was also studying for her U.S. citizenship exam, which she passed on the last day of April. Lupino's friend, columnist Hedda Hopper, used this occasion as an excuse to hype Lupino's career transformation over the years, from struggling ingenue to award-winning dramatic star to, now, "helping" Bogeaus produce <em>Early Autumn</em> and soon to "turn full producer".  Hopper separately reported that Lupino was planning to produce a film for Dorothy Lamour after completing her first for Bogeaus.</p>

<p>April 1947 was a momentous month in Lupino's life for another reason. While the press reported that she and Clark Gable were "sparking" and that Gable was wooing her with flowers, she turned down Gable's advances and instead took up with Warner Brothers executive, and aspiring writer and producer, Collier Young. She and Young were to marry in late 1948 and become partners in the next, far more successful, phase of Lupino's producing career—forming Emerald Productions in 1949 and re-constituting it as The Filmakers later that year.</p>

<p>With the anticipated June 1947 starting date of <em>Early Autumn</em> approaching, Lupino and Bogeaus continued to try to nail down the production. Lupino was also working on her potential second film at Arcadia, <em>The Queen's Necklace</em> and talking with Hurd Hatfield to be her leading man in that film.  Columnist Sheilah Graham reported that Lupino "says it's fun being a producer because every one loves her and every one wants her to give them a job!"</p>

<p>Talks continued through May with actors Arthur Kennedy, Robert Preston, and director King Vidor about <em>Early Autumn</em>, but nothing was formalized. Hopper once reported that Lupino had signed King Vidor to direct—but no one else picked that up, so it presumably was premature.</p>

<p>Soon, the axe fell on <em>Early Autumn</em>. Hedda Hopper broke the news on June 6:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ben Bogeaus tells me that since neither he nor Ida likes the script of "Early Autumn", they'll wait until they get a good one before making the picture. Meanwhile, Ida's free to make an outside film.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reasons for the delay—and effective cancellation—were likely more complicated than Hopper's item suggested. Subsequent reports suggest Bogeaus' other commitments effectively squeezed out <em>Early Autumn</em>. His current production of <em>A Miracle Can Happen</em> (later retitled <em>On Our Merry Way</em>) had just had a troublesome preview and needed substantial re-shoots. And Bogeaus had a commitment to begin work on <em>Lulu Belle</em> on August 11, based on the loan-out agreement for its star Dorothy Lamour. As reported by <em>Film Bulletin</em>, the money coming as as part of the Lamour deal made it a top priority, as Bogeaus' only source of revenue at the time was <em>The Macomber Affair</em>.</p>

<p>Sheilah Graham needled Lupino in her column: "Being a producer isn't all it's cracked up to be, eh, Ida?" Graham also suggested Lupino was on the verge of returning to Warner Brothers "because the script of <em>Early Autumn</em> has her licked."</p>

<p>Warner Brothers was indeed ramping up efforts to woo her back—but without success. <em>Early Autumn</em> may have been moribund, but Producer Lupino was not. </p>

<p><strong><em>Miracle in the Rain</em></strong></p>

<p>Lupino then attempted to re-purchase her own screenplay, <em>Miss Pennington</em>—the one she had sold to RKO a couple years earlier (see the <a href="../../../2021/02/a-forgotten-chapter-in-ida-lupinos-career.html">first edition</a> of this story for a reminder), but was unable to close that deal. Yet, in less than a month, Lupino had a new project underway. Louella Parsons wrote in her July 5 column:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ida Lupino, who recently put her feet under a desk as a woman producer for Ben Bogeaus, has selected her first. She will boss and star in "Miracle in the Rain", a Ben Hecht magazine story published about four years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e49200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e49200b img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Miracle In The Rain cover" title="Miracle In The Rain cover" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e9930e49200b-250wi" /></a>Once again the publicity for Arcadia Productions kicked into gear. <em>Miracle in the Rain</em> was being adapted by Dwight Taylor. It would go into production as soon as the screenplay was ready. Lupino and Bogeaus again wanted King Vidor to direct. <em>Early Autumn</em> was still on the books as Lupino's second vehicle. Arcadia was still planning to produce pictures other than those starring Lupino. </p>

<p>Five weeks later, alas, this project was in dire straits as well—though most of the details do not appear to have made it into print. Lupino's choice for her leading man in <em>Miracle in the Rain</em> was Robert Walker—not yet famous for the creepy murderer in Alfred Hitchcock's <em>Strangers on a Train</em> (1951), but instead for romantic leads such as opposite Judy Garland in <em>The Clock</em> (1945). MGM, however, refused to loan him out—which Erskine Johnson reported left Walker "burning". Lupino's reaction is not documented.</p>

<p>Less than two weeks after that, on August 21, 1947, Hedda Hopper reported with little fanfare that <em>Miracle in the Rain</em> had been "postponed indefinitely". No reasons given; no excuses reported. </p>

<p>Producer Lupino was soon ready to throw in the towel. On September 3, Sheilah Graham wrote, "Ida Lupino and Benedict Bogeaus have called off their picture deal. They couldn't get together on story or price." And so Arcadia Productions was no more.</p>

<p><strong>Aftermath</strong></p>

<p>The last weeks of Arcadia was the period where Lupino's romance with Collier Young blossomed. Given their joint ambitions as filmmakers, Lupino may have become distracted by new goals—both personal and professional. That is what is suggested in the Donati biography.</p>

<p>Some hints as to Lupino's view of her experience an attempted producer in 1947 come from later comments. In April, 1948, Bob Thomas reported her saying about producing</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Never again! I passed up four pictures while I was working myself practically to death on a film that was never made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then, a decade later, long after she had become a successful producer-director-writer, she was asked about the beginnings of her next attempt at an independent production company on the <em>This Is Your Life</em> television program. She said to the host, "Let me, you know, put myself completely in the clear. I did not want to become a producer." Then she laughed and added, "They're very badly-treated people." Her real goal in starting Emerald Productions and The Filmakers was discovering new talent.</p>

<p>Could it be that her disinclination to return to producing was the result of her experiences in 1947? After all, even early in her Arcadia tenure, she had said she was ready to declare a "Be Kind to Producers Week".</p>

<p>Going back to the late summer of 1947, Lupino did not let this failure as a first-time producer stop her. Even as she was shutting down Arcadia, she was hard at work piecing together her next acting gig. She had already picked a story, <em>The Dark Love</em>. Through the arrangements of her and her agent with 20th Century-Fox, this would soon become the noir classic <em>Road House</em> (1948). </p>

<p>A few months after that, despite her vow of "Never again!", she would be producing independent films—this time using unknown actors she discovered—and this time with unforgettable results.</p>

<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>

<p><em>Early Autumn</em> never made it into movie form. Ben Bogeaus made another attempt to produce it in 1956, retitled <em>Conquest</em>, but again nothing came of it.</p>

<p><em>Miracle in the Rain</em> passed through several hands before being made at Warner Brothers in 1955, starring Jane Wyman and Van Johnson, directed by Rudolf Maté.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This is the story of a non-legendary chapter in a legendary career—the story of Ida Lupino's first attempt to become a film producer in Hollywood. It was a frustrating experience that set the stage for her later triumphs.</p>

<p>The legendary part of Lupino's story is that, in 1949, she left her career as an established Hollywood movie star to become the driving force behind an independent production company—eventually known as "The Filmakers". There, with collaborators Collier Young and Malvin Wald, she wrote, produced, and directed low-budget films, initially starring unknown actors, that told stories the major studios of the time were not addressing. </p>

<p>Less known is that Lupino's first attempt to move behind-the-scenes into film production came two years earlier. This chapter of the Lupino story is typically ignored in overviews of her career. Even the comprehensive biography by William Donati devotes only a single paragraph to it.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98cc1ee200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98cc1ee200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino portrait, circa 1945" title="Ida Lupino portrait, circa 1945" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98cc1ee200b-250wi" /></a>For this initial effort as producer, her approach was very different from her later one. Her goal was to produce films at the same level as the major studios with herself as the star—continuing her acting career, but with creative control. After many months of hard work through most of 1947, she was left with no visible accomplishments. Yet it is likely that from this discouraging episode, she learned lessons that helped make her later creative efforts successful—and that immortalized her career.</p>

<p>To set the stage, let's begin a couple years earlier—January 1945. The end of the all-consuming war was in sight, Lupino's six-year marriage had recently broken up, and Lupino was emerging from that emotional trauma contemplating her life. </p>

<p>At the age of 27, Lupino claimed she was "flummoxed" about her career and seriously considering a major change. At the time, she was a Hollywood veteran of over a decade, at the height of her fame, with a stellar reputation as one of the top dramatic actresses in the industry. But, as she told columnist Erskine Johnson:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"I'll go berserk if I'm still dashing around at 30 [getting up at 5 o'clock every morning making myself look beautiful and then rushing to the studio]. 
  I have a time now making myself look good—and I've got a voice like Wallace Beery's."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She had long known that her time at the top would be limited, and that she needed alternatives in order to survive in Hollywood when her leading actress days were over. Her present plan was to give up acting and become a full-time writer.</p>

<p>Her acting contract with Warner Brothers still had two more years to go. Over those two years, she used her down time to sample various plans for the next phase of her career. She worked on several screenplays, often in collaboration with others—notably her ex-husband, actor Louis Hayward, and actress Barbara Read. In early 1946, Lupino sold one of her screenplays to RKO—<em>Miss Pennington</em>—for $20,000.</p>

<p>Music was another major effort, building on what had been a passion of hers for years. She wrote numerous songs, by herself and in collaboration with Nick Arden and William MacIlwinen. In the spring of 1946, she and MacIlwinen undertook to get a musical stage show produced on Broadway. Lupino took a three-month leave-of-absence from her Warners contract to push this project to completion. Unfortunately, it did not come to fruition as a Broadway show; however, it was eventually produced at a smaller venue in 1949. (See this <a href="../../../2020/05/ida-lupinos-apple-tree-farm.html">earlier article</a> for more on <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>.)</p>

<p>Another approach was to continue acting, but to produce her own films. For Lupino, who had been battling studio executives for years over scripts, the lure of creative freedom beckoned. Initially she contemplated a co-producing-acting partnership with ex-husband Hayward, with whom she remained friendly and who also had self-producing ambitions. </p>

<p>But she went a different route. Enter independent producer Benedict Bogeaus. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202788011e862200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e202788011e862200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Producer Benedict Bogeaus with wife, actress Dolores Moran, circa 1950s" title="Producer Benedict Bogeaus with wife, actress Dolores Moran, circa 1950s" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e202788011e862200d-250wi" /></a>Ben Bogeaus was a businessman who had made a lot of money in the early years of the war, and then, in 1944, moved to Hollywood to produce films. Bogeaus' movies had name stars and respectable budgets. His company had already released three films by the end of 1945, and his ambitions were expanding. In January 1946, Lupino—with a year left on her Warners contract—signed on to star in one of Bogeaus' pictures. Initially there was no mention of her producing.</p>

<p>At this same time, Lupino claimed that she would be willing to extend her time with Warners <em>if</em> they let her pick stories and directors. While Warners likely would never cede so much control, this indicates Lupino's producing ambition had solidified. In March, 1946, it became explicit. Lupino told Hedda Hopper, "I'd like to get into writing and producing. Acting is too tortuous."</p>

<p>As the Broadway hopes for her stage show slipped away, her next Warner Brothers film suffered delays, and the one with Bogeaus was on hold, Lupino continued her writing work on music and screenplays, while also enjoying a newfound passion for sailing.</p>

<p>Late in 1946, she revealed to the press that one of the sticking points in her negotiations with Warner Brothers was that she wanted the right to independently produce one picture a year—"<em>which I've already contracted to do</em>" (emphasis added). This is the first sign I have found that her deal with Bogeaus had extended from acting into producing. She also said that she was comparing notes on the challenges of being a producer with friend and fellow actor-turned-producer John Garfield.</p>

<p>Lupino left her longtime studio in early 1947, refusing to sign the long-term exclusive contract Warners insisted on. Within days of completing her last film at Warners, <em>Deep Valley</em>, Lupino, along with Bogeaus, announced the formation of a new company to house their joint effort—a company separate from Bogeaus' own. Louella Parsons wrote on Feb. 5, 1947:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those swanky new offices being redecorated on the Ben Bogeaus lot are for Ida Lupino, who moves over to General Service Studio [Bogeaus' lot at the time] as a producer as well as star.</p>
  
  <p>She and Ben have formed the Arcadia Productions, with Ida set for one film a year for the next three years. </p>
  
  <p>Ida's first is a comedy, "New Year's Eve", an original story by Norman Reilly Raine. 
  Ida plays an heiress who gets kidnaped on New Year's Eve by a prize fighter and a G.I. and the complications that ensue can be imagined. </p>
  
  <p>I'll say for Bogeaus that he tries to keep his stars happy by letting them have their say about their movies. Gregory Peck has a "piece" of "Macomber Affair" 
  and Burgess Meredith is co-producer of "A Miracle Can Happen" and several other pictures he's made with Ben.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Over much of the succeeding year, Ida Lupino would devote her prodigious energies to her new role as producer of her own films. We will see how that turned out in the next edition.</p>

Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph, March 3, 1945" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4313361200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Yesterday, while going through newspaper archives, I ran across a great photo of Ida Lupino dancing with Lt. William MacIlwinen in early 1945. </p>

<p>Who is MacIlwinen, or—as the newspaper caption erroneously spells it—"Macwillinen"? </p>

<p>MacIlwinen is the fellow that Miss Lupino teamed with in early 1946, roughly a year after this photo was published, to write the score for her musical adaptation of her deceased father's stage comedy <em>Apple Tree Farm</em>. For the dozen-plus songs they wrote for this show, MacIlwinen wrote the tunes while Ida contributed the lyrics.</p>

<p>Long-time readers may remember my "discovery", back in May, that <em>Apple Tree Farm</em> had not gone unproduced—as I had assumed based on other readings. In fact, it had been produced in 1949 at the University of North Carolina.</p>

<p>If you don't remember or aren't a long-time reader, please be sure to go back and read about it here: "<a href="../../../2020/05/ida-lupinos-apple-tree-farm.html">Ida Lupino's Apple Tree Farm</a>". I think it is quite a story!</p>

<p>For Ida Lupino, music and songwriting were, for many years, one of her primary interests outside of her career in films. So, of course, she had other musical collaborators besides Lt. MacIlwinen. But I do believe she only had one musical comedy stage show produced. And so MacIlwinen should hold special prominence in accounts of Miss Lupino's musical accomplishments, and finding photographs of the two of them together is a special occasion.</p>

<p>The photo caption says, by the way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>LEARNING 'LESSON' — The three R's now include "rhumba" 
  when Ida Lupino dances with Lt. William Macwillinen, 
  a former North Carolina school teacher. 
  Lt. Macwillinen also is a songwriter and Ida helps him with his work,
  when he needs her assistance.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdeafd832200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdeafd832200c img-responsive" alt="Ida Lupino Directs, Hedda Hopper.

<blockquote>
  <p>Ida Lupino always wanted to direct. 
  Now she's doing it—directing the drama
  group from the Lockheed-Vega swing shift in their production of 
  "You Can't Take it With You." 
  In that crew are many noted actors, including stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A couple days earlier, on April 26, this news item had appeared in the Los Angeles Daily News, headlined "Ida Lupino to direct drama":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Screen actress Ida Lupino accepted an invitation yesterday to direct 
  the dramatically inclined aircrafters at Lockheed-Vega swingshift
  in their forthcoming stage show 
  "You Can't Take It With You".</p>
  
  <p>Three rehearsals a week will be held, starting next Thursday at 1 a.m.</p>
  
  <p>The workers to their first crack at histrionics last year with the 
  production of "Return Engagement".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven't yet been able to find anything else about this. Was it a part-time, "guest director" thing (if such a thing exists)? Or did she take several weeks, which is what it would presumably have taken, to do the full job?</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98285d0200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98285d0200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Swing Shift Maisie poster" title="Swing Shift Maisie poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e98285d0200b-250wi" /></a>Ida was in between films at Warner Brothers at this point, having recently completed <em>Devotion</em> with Olivia de Havilland and Paul Henreid. The next film she started was <em>In Our Time</em>, which didn't get underway until June. So she may well have had the time and opportunity to spend a few weeks helping the Lockheed-Vega crew out.</p>

<p>It also struck me that this scenario—a glamorous movie star steps in the direct a ragtag crew of aircraft war workers, likely including many Rosie-the-Riveter types, in the middle of the night—seems ready-made for a screenplay. It could be a combination of <em>Swing Shift Maisie</em> and the Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland 'let's-put-on-a-show' musicals.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b62e200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b62e200d img-responsive" style="width: 400px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Moontide poster" title="Moontide poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b62e200d-400wi" /></a>The movie <em>Moontide</em> (1942) made a big impact on me when I first saw it nearly four years ago, as one of the earliest of Ida Lupino's films that I watched. What hit me were its touching romance, its wonderful performances, and its unique and memorable atmospherics—claustrophobic and dark despite its mostly outdoors seaside setting. </p>

<p><em>Moontide</em> is the tale of the relationship between a drifter and the troubled woman he rescues from an attempted suicide, and the complications due to the jealousy of one of the drifter's companions. </p>

<p>The film was described as a "noir fairy tale" in the 2008 mini-documentary on the making of the film—a phrase which I find to be a concise and accurate description.</p>

<p>What follows is the story behind the making of this memorable film. It is based on what I have learned via press reports in newspapers, trade papers, and fan magazines from the time of the film's production—with occasional contributions from later sources. I would love to be able to explore documents contained in the 20th Century-Fox archives, but alas, that remains a task for some indeterminate future. Meanwhile, the mini-documentary, <em>Turning the Tide: The Ill-Starred Making of Moontide</em>, provides a window to some internal studio discussions.</p>

<p>The story is particularly compelling because the stars of <em>Moontide</em>, Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino, are both fascinating people who were at critical moments in their respective careers. And, among other things, production of the film coincided with the entry of the United States into World War 2.</p>

<p><strong>Origins</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5bf7200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5bf7200b img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="About the Author page for Willard Robertson" title="About the Author page for Willard Robertson" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5bf7200b-250wi" /></a>The story of <em>Moontide</em> begins with the prolific character actor Willard Robertson, who had been a lawyer and playwright earlier in his career. Robertson wrote the novel, titled <em>Moon Tide</em>, while working on location on the set of the 20th Century-Fox epic <em>Brigham Young</em>. This was Robertson's first novel, yet upon its publication in the summer of 1940, it immediately attracted the attention of Hollywood studios. 20th Century-Fox soon purchased the rights for $30,000. (See this <a href="../../../2020/11/the-making-of-moontide-1942-origins.html">earlier essay</a> for more on Robertson and his novel.)</p>

<p><strong>Enter Jean Gabin</strong></p>

<p>In April, 1941, Fox production chief Darryl Zanuck decided that story of <em>Moon Tide</em> would be ideal as the first Hollywood vehicle for the French star Jean Gabin.</p>

<p>Gabin had just arrived in Hollywood after several years of resisting overtures from American movie producers. At the time of those earlier refusals, Gabin had said, "I am happy in France. My friends and my people live here. Money is unimportant." But he changed his mind about working in Hollywood after the Nazi take-over of France. </p>

<p>A year before the <em>Moon Tide</em> announcement, Gabin was still in France, on a leave from the French navy, when the German invasion cut him off from his ship. He fled from his home outside Paris towards the south of France, literally a few minutes ahead of the invading forces—in a harrowing three-week journey along roads congested with refugees. By the time he arrived at the port of Toulon for his next Navy assignment, the French had signed an armistice and he was demobilized. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b4f7200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b4f7200c img-responsive" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Jean Gabin in the 1939 French film Remorques" title="Jean Gabin in the 1939 French film Remorques" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b4f7200c-200wi" /></a>Before long, German officials approached Gabin and offered him the choice of putting his celebrity to use in making Nazi propaganda films or else risking confinement in a concentration camp. He decided this was the time to seek work in Hollywood. He contacted a producer friend, Andre Devan, who had moved to the American film capital before the war and now worked at 20th Century-Fox, for help arranging visas and transportation to the United States. Devan went to Darryl Zanuck, who jumped at the chance to sign the French star. </p>

<p>Gabin's signing by 20th Century-Fox was reported by Louella Parsons in late January 1941. Gabin traveled to Lisbon and sailed for the U.S. in late February. He arrived in New York City aboard the <em>Exeter</em> in early March, after what he described as "the worst trip I ever had in my life." Amongst the few possessions he had with him were his favorite bicycle and his accordion. He did not speak any English. </p>

<p>The press quoted him saying regarding the feelings of his fellow Frenchmen about the war:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those who are pro-British say every night in their prayers, 
  Please God let the gallant British win quickly.
  Those who are anti-British say 
  Please God let the dirty British win right away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gabin's arrival in New York City was one day too late for him to attend the U.S. opening of his 1937 hit <em>Pepe le Moko</em>. (That French-made film had been re-made in Hollywood in 1938 as <em>Algiers</em>, starring Charles Boyer. To avoid competition, the original had been withheld from the American market for several years.)</p>

<p>After a week, Gabin left by train for California. He arrived on March 17, ill from a combination of flu and nerves. 20th Century-Fox took him to the desert in Palm Springs to allow him to recuperate for a couple weeks. The studio's plans were to give Gabin six months to learn English before they would expect him to start on any movies. </p>

<p>Gabin reported to the studio in early April and talked to the Hollywood press for the first time, using Andre Devan as a translator. A week later, Zanuck, with Gabin's approval, selected Robertson's novel <em>Moon Tide</em> for the actor's screen debut in America. Zanuck assigned Mark Hellinger as producer and John O'Hara to write the screenplay. A week later, Ida Lupino—a favorite of Hellinger's, who had worked with her on two films the previous year at Warner Bros.—was reported to be Gabin's co-star. (For more on the casting of Lupino's role in <em>Moontide</em>, see this <a href="../../../2020/10/which-actresses-were-considered-for-jean-gabins-co-star-in-moontide.html">earlier essay</a>.)</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5ce3200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5ce3200b img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich at the premiere of Sundown, October 1941" title="Jean Gabin and Marlene Dietrich at the premiere of Sundown, October 1941" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5ce3200b-250wi" /></a>Gabin was a big hit with the Hollywood press corps. "The man of the hour right now in Hollywood is Jean Gabin," wrote Dorothy Manners in early May. The gossip columnists noted that Marlene Dietrich had quickly become his primary public companion, though Ginger Rogers intruded occasionally. (Gabin was in a long-term separation from his wife in France, though the press often portrayed him as single.) The press  frequently described Gabin as "the French Spencer Tracy". This moniker did not please Gabin, but he soon met with Tracy himself and the two became friendly.</p>

<p>By late May, some press reports suggested that 20th Century-Fox was considering putting Gabin into a different movie for his American debut—<em>Swamp Water</em>, to be directed by fellow French expatriate Jean Renoir. These notions were put to rest publicly by mid-June and <em>Moontide</em> was again the target for Gabin's first Hollywood production.</p>

<p>During these early months in Hollywood from the spring to the fall of 1941, Gabin learned English via his studio-assigned tutor, with significant assistance from Marlene Dietrich, and from studying the films of Clark Gable. He felt that to be effective he must be able think in English. Gabin was displeased with the initial script, and Nunnally Johnson was brought in to re-write it.</p>

<p><strong>Ida Lupino: "The most sought after young actress in Hollywood"</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b763200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b763200d img-responsive" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino portrait from Out of the Fog 1941" title="Ida Lupino portrait from Out of the Fog 1941" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428b763200d-200wi" /></a>For Ida Lupino, the months between her casting in late April and the eventual start of  filming in November were eventful. As of April, 23-year-old Lupino was on a nearly year-long run of successful films at Warner Bros. since her career-making turn in <em>They Drive By Night</em>. She had done co-starring roles in <em>High Sierra</em> and <em>The Sea Wolf</em>, and was at that time wrapping up another one in <em>Out of the Fog</em>.</p>

<p>Lupino had the career foresight to avoid signing an exclusive contract with Warners when she hit it big there. Her next project was a starring vehicle at Columbia for her and her husband Louis Hayward—the thriller <em>Ladies in Retirement</em>. She had also signed a two-picture deal with 20th Century-Fox, of which <em>Moontide</em> was the first announced.  In June, Warners started preparing their first starring vehicle for Lupino, <em>The Hard Way</em>, which initially was targeted to begin in September or October. </p>

<p>In July, Louella Parsons described Lupino as "the most sought after young actress in Hollywood". Parsons announced that 20th Century-Fox had another project for her, opposite Tyrone Power in <em>Benjamin Blake</em> (later renamed <em>Son of Fury</em>), a swashbuckling adventure film. This one fell through for Lupino, though—perhaps due to what happened next at Warner Bros.</p>

<p>Warners had additional plans for Lupino before <em>The Hard Way</em>. They wanted her to play a supporting role in <em>Kings Row</em> behind Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Lupino did not like the role or the billing. After heated discussions, she turned it down. Warners suspended her and assigned her the title role in <em>Juke Girl</em>. After more heated discussions, she also refused to do that one—and received another suspension in early October.

This likely smoothed the way for her to shift to 20th Century-Fox for <em>Moontide</em> before her scheduled return to Warners for <em>The Hard Way</em>.</p>

<p>On November 10, just a few days before she reported to Fox, Lupino co-presided at an event she had helped organize—to raise funds to help several dozen refugee European artists and scholars being held in Nazi concentration camps in occupied France to travel to the U.S. Columnist Cal York wrote in <em>Photoplay</em>, "Orson Welles and Ida Lupino presided and never has Cal heard more stirring speeches than the ones delivered by these two."</p>

<p><strong>Production begins</strong></p>

<p>Back in late September, on Nunnally Johnson's recommendation, Fox had hired famous surrealist artist Salvador Dali to construct a nightmare sequence for <em>Moontide</em>. The studio planned to evaluate the sketches Dali produced and then decide if it was feasible to reproduce them. In the end, the set carpenters were baffled by what Dali asked for and the nightmare sequence ended up being designed by others.</p>

<p>As November approached, 20th Century-Fox and Jean Gabin were ready to begin <em>Moontide</em>. Fritz Lang was assigned to direct. Thomas Mitchell was given the role of the jealous friend, while Claude Rains was cast as the "gentle philosopher". Gabin and Lang spent a day at the harbor at San Pedro gathering "color" for the film. For additional color, Lupino, in a story related by her biographer William Donati, took Gabin on a reconnaissance of the streets of skid row in central Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Lupino almost missed her first day of wardrobe tests at Fox in mid-November. When she didn't arrive on time, the studio called her house, and her house boy found Lupino unconscious in the bathroom, reportedly felled by ether fumes while cleaning her hair.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6132200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6132200b img-responsive" style="width: 400px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Noir lighting on the watery set of Moontide" title="Noir lighting on the watery set of Moontide" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6132200b-400wi" /></a>Shooting started the week of Thanksgiving, on Monday, November 24. The plot-line, as reported in the trade papers—involving a potential suicide by Gabin's character and the death of Lupino's character—was quite different from what emerged in the final product. That first week, Sen Young, a young Chinese actor playing the part of a Japanese fisherman, was quoted in the press discussing how the character he played was "unwholesome". He added, in apparent reference to the Japanese atrocities in China over the previous few years, "I think my countrymen will understand."</p>

<p>The large boxer dog that accompanies Gabin's drifter character Bobo for most of the film was discovered by Fritz Lang one day when he was taking a shortcut across a neighbor's yard and was chased by it. Lang decided the dog, named Officer Smith, was a good symbol of Bobo, so he cast the dog in the film.</p>

<p>Jean Gabin's acting style led to some complications with his male supporting cast in the early days of the production, as related by Whitney Bolton of the Philadelphia Inquirer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is Jean Gabin's first American picture and the French star is a noted under-player. He speaks quietly, slowly and in low tones. ... 
  Thomas Mitchell, next in rank, came on the set for work and saw Gabin—and heard him. "He's playing it down," said Tommy. "I'll show them what playing down really is." And he started underplaying.
  Claude Rains came on the picture the third day, quickly saw what he was up against, and set out to teach two seasoned under-players how really to underplay.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After a few days of this underplaying contest, Zanuck saw the rushes and sent out a short note, concluding with "Get that dialogue up to where we can hear what they are saying."</p>

<p><strong>Pearl Harbor attacked, Fritz Lang departs</strong></p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bad1200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bad1200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino in Moontide" title="Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino in Moontide" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bad1200d-250wi" /></a>Less than two weeks into production, the country was shaken by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The U.S. was now at war, and the entire west coast, was gripped by fear of Japanese air raids or even an invasion. Los Angeles harbor was suddenly off-limits to filming, which made it fortuitous that producer Hellinger had earlier had a bait barge set built on the Fox studio lot. This set would end up a large part of the unique atmospherics of <em>Moontide</em>.</p>

<p>War, and the potential of air raids or invasion, did not catch Ida Lupino unprepared. For the previous six months, she had been training and serving in the local chapter of the Women's Ambulance and Defense Corps. The training for the ambulance driving and dispatch duties had involved first aid, mechanics, and more. Lupino took her duties, including being on 24-hour call for emergencies, seriously and was commissioned a lieutenant shortly after the new year.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bbaf200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bbaf200d img-responsive" alt="Claude Rains, Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino on the set of Moontide" title="Claude Rains, Jean Gabin and Ida Lupino on the set of Moontide" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be428bbaf200d-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Around the time of Pearl Harbor, Fritz Lang was removed from the project and Archie Mayo took over the direction. Press reports initially suggested Lang and the studio differed over story development. A later column by Sheilah Graham suggested that Lang and Gabin had severe difficulties working together due to the language barrier.  Gabin said, "When I started my first Hollywood picture, <em>Moontide</em>, I was nervous and couldn't understand a word anyone said." After Mayo took over, "suddenly I found I understood everything."</p>

<p>Story changes were indeed made to <em>Moontide</em> right after the Pearl Harbor attack. Fox chief Darryl Zanuck and Hellinger decided to make the ending more upbeat by not having Lupino's character die. Was this, on top of the language difficulties with the star, what led to Lang's leaving the film?</p>

<p><strong>Assorted production notes</strong></p>

<p>Despite the subtitle of Fox's mini-documentary on the 2008 DVD—"The Ill-Starred Making of Moontide"—subsequent proceedings on the set appear to have gone fairly smoothly.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6008200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6008200b img-responsive" style="width: 220px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino in wardrobe for Moontide" title="Ida Lupino in wardrobe for Moontide" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6008200b-250wi" /></a>Several press items cite that Ida Lupino's wardrobe for <em>Moontide</em> cost the meager total of $19.72. A column in <em>Modern Screen</em> magazine expanded on that, saying that "Ida admits depressing outfits have a bad effect on her—make her feel lowdown." So just before filming began, she bought a "luscious new wardrobe to help her shake her gloom after a day at the studio." But after the Pearl Harbor attack, she put her new clothes in a trunk and vowed to stick to her Women's Ambulance Corps uniform.</p>

<p>In mid-January, Thomas Mitchell was being affected by what he had to do for his first time playing a villain. After two days of filming a scene where he had to beat up  Lupino and throw her into a tank of live bait, he was allegedly a "complete wreck". Interestingly, no such scene exists in the copy of the film available on DVD today—the beating is implied via editing. Was the brutal scene cut before or after the initial previews and why?</p>

<p>A few days later, Hedda Hopper reported that Lupino was "limping about with a gash on her leg caused by a fall off the moat on the set of <em>Moontide</em>". Can we presume this was not related to the beating scene?</p>

<p>Director Mayo adjusted his attitude to some repeated airborne frustrations while filming an outdoor scene, as reported by Paul Harrison:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally everything seemed to be straightened out for another try. Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin took their places. But as the scene began, Mayo spotted the approaching specks of a particularly big covey of Army planes. "Cut!" He screamed. "Here come some more Army bombers—"</p>
  
  <p>But even as he yelled it, Mayo's expression changed and his rage subsided in a shrug. He grinned and added:
  ". . . thank God!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On January 30, Ida Lupino filmed an exhausting scene where her character attempted to drown herself in the ocean—filmed in a pool on the lot. Oily scum, kelp, and other floating debris were added to the water to enhance the realism. As related by columnist Frederick Othman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inside, Miss Lupino was swimming and swimming and swimming. It was tough. Every time she was about to go under, something went wrong. An arc would burn out. The kelp would sink. The waves would be too high.</p>
  
  <p>That worried Mayo, a kindly citizen. It pained him to see his leading lady shivering there between swims, and then to see her paddling down the middle of the pool. She already had a cold, and she was feeling badly.
  After nearly two hours of it, she was a weary lady. (The art of the motion picture sometimes is an exhausting one.)</p>
  
  <p>Eleven a.m. came. The waves were exactly right. The arcs were primed. The seaweed was in the proper place.
  And there was Miss Lupino swimming wearily from her end of the pool toward the camera. She was using a kind of dog paddle, keeping her head high out of the scummy water.</p>
  
  <p>"Get your hair wet, honey," called Mayo.</p>
  
  <p>Miss Lupino tried, but she could not bring herself to go under—too tired, maybe, and too nervous. She got to the middle of the kelp and she almost passed out.
  "Archie," she called, "I'm all done in."</p>
  
  <p>Two stalwarts in swimming trunks dived in and hauled her to shore. Mayo sent his assistant outside for a slug of brandy, strictly for medicinal purposes.
  The man brought back two glasses. One held the brandy, the other contained a water chaser.
  Miss Lupino gulped the brandy. Then she took the glass of water and poured it over her head.</p>
  
  <p>Next she climbed into the ocean, paddled to the middle of it and sank. Perfectly. Everything exactly right, including wet hair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is another case where very little of this arduous scene appears to have made it into the final cut.</p>

<p>Gabin's brief shirtless scene early in the film was added at the insistence of his frequent companion Marlene Dietrich. She wanted to show off the muscles he had developed from bicycle rides around Beverly Hills.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5f8e200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5f8e200b img-responsive" alt="Director Archie Mayo with Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin on the set of Moontide" title="Director Archie Mayo with Ida Lupino and Jean Gabin on the set of Moontide" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c5f8e200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Robin Coons related some good-natured ribbing while filming one day, as Gabin, with the dog beside him as usual, strode along the breakwater on the set. On the sidelines, Lupino watched him and said, "He's swell!" Mayo chimed in, "What a sweet guy! He's swell!" and other crew members then joined in a chorus of compliments.</p>

<p>Ida Lupino's friend Joan Fontaine was starring in <em>This Above All</em> on the Fox lot at the same time that <em>Moontide</em> was in production. One day, as <em>Modern Screen</em> reported, Lupino and Fontaine were having lunch in Fontaine's dressing room when Fontaine's co-star Tyrone Power asked to join them. The next day, Power brought Charles Boyer from the <em>Tales of Manhattan</em> set. As the days went by, more and more stars joined the group and it became known around the studio as the Fontaine salon.</p>

<p>During this period, Lupino and Fontaine wrote joint articles about each other and their friendship that were published in <em>Hollywood</em> magazine's June 1941 issue: "Loopy Lupino" by Joan Fontaine, and "Mad Pixie" by Ida Lupino. Amongst other interesting tidbits, Lupino wrote that they dropped into each others' dressing rooms daily, and one time they rhumbaed all through lunch before Archie Mayo came in saying, "Get some rest before I paddle you."</p>

<p><strong>After production</strong></p>

<p>As <em>Moontide</em> wrapped production in mid-February 1942, a new romance between Jean Gabin and Ginger Rogers was heating up in the press. The two had a few dates the previous spring when he was new arrival and knew little English. Then in January, he visited Ginger on the set of Fox's <em>Tales of Manhattan</em>. Now they were an item. </p>

<p>"When [Ginger] left by train for her Oregon ranch, it was Jean who had flowers wired to Ginger at every train stop!" reported the column <em>May Mann's Going Hollywood</em>. On February 17, Ginger arrived in New York on vacation and to attend the premiere of her film <em>Roxie Hart</em>. Jean Gabin arrived in New York the next day and was seen "here, there and everywhere" around town with her, according to Sheilah Graham. At the <em>Roxie Hart</em> premiere, they sat in the front row of the balcony and held hands. Gabin had his own press reception at the Waldorf-Astoria on February 20. Ginger was among those in attendance.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6195200b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6195200b img-responsive" alt="Moontide Ad They'll Be Gabbin About Gabin" title="Moontide Ad They'll Be Gabbin About Gabin" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e97c6195200b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>By mid-April, Fox had positive initial screenings of <em>Moontide</em> and had scheduled the official "world premiere" for April 29 at the Rivoli theater on Broadway. The studio launched a big advertising push almost exclusively focused on Jean Gabin and his sex appeal to women and his working-man appeal to men. They were clearly hoping that Gabin could be turned into an American star on the order of Clark Gable. The ads barely discussed the movie and only briefly mentioned Lupino and the top-notch supporting cast of Claude Rains and Thomas Mitchell. (See this <a href="https://www.typepad.com/site/blogs/6a00d83451ffec69e201b8d2b2365c970c/post/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e96ffa4a200b/edit">earlier essay</a> for some examples of Fox's "Gabbin' About Gabin" advertising campaign.)</p>

<p>A statement about why women were attracted to Gabin was reportedly told by Lupino to producer Hellinger—and fit right in to the marketing: "First, it's his boyishness. You want to mother him to help him along. And then you feel you never know when you're going to get a punch in the jaw." </p>

<p>Gabin travelled to New York City to attend the premiere. Marlene Dietrich accompanied him, as his brief attachment to Ginger Rogers had ended by April. The American Theater Wing War Service sponsored the event, with proceeds going to their war relief efforts such as the Stage Door Canteen. </p>

<p>The premiere was the first to be held on Broadway under new war-time "dim-out" regulations. The dim-out was an attempt to prevent skyglow from city lights that led to enemy submarines being able to spot silhouetted allied ships far out at sea. The customary spotlights and other brilliant displays were not turned on—the only lights on the outside of the theater were the marquee, and those were turned off at 10 pm. Famed opera singer and movie star Grace Moore opened the festivities by singing the national anthem. More than two hundred members of the Free French movement were in attendance and the theater was "virtually filled to capacity".</p>

<p><strong>Reception</strong></p>

<p>Reviews for Jean Gabin were almost uniformly positive. Lupino and the supporting cast were also very well-received. Reviews for the movie were frequently positive, but far more mixed. The mood, atmosphere, and romance that is so appealing to some, including me, was not universally so.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b8af200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b8af200c img-responsive" alt="Moontide poster" title="Moontide poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea9b8af200c-320wi" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a><em>Film Daily</em> wrote, "[Gabin] is a blessed relief from the pretty-boy type that has cluttered up American screens.<em>Motion Picture Herald</em> called him "enormously effective". Herbert Cohn of the Brooklyn Eagle said he is a "vastly appealing romantic actor". Walter Winchell wrote that Gabin "will be darling of the fan clubs when the femmes get over their gasps and organize".</p>

<p>Lupino was also singled out for her contribution. <em>Showmens Trade Review</em> said, "Ida Lupino achieves such a sensitive and deeply impressive performance of the outcast saved from self-destruction that one is easily tempted to single it out as the picture's finest." Wanda Hale of the New York Daily News wrote, "The role of the girl is in the hands of one of the best, Ida Lupino, who has been commanding lavish praise from critics since she gave up comedy for drama."</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Motion Picture Herald</em> said that "<em>Moontide</em> has the indelible touch of art, which assures its appeal to critics, but it also has the indelible touch of life, which insures a much wider audience." <em>Photoplay</em> magazine gave it their top rating of "outstanding" and placed Gabin and Lupino at the top of their list of "Best performances of the month". </p>

<p>Two prominent publications came down more harshly on the movie, however. <em>Variety</em> wrote that "as a box office and entertainment entry, the picture scores only moderately" and that "Gabin doesn't show the spark of Gable or Tracy". They did add that "Miss Lupino shows talent, freshness and perfect adaptability for her role." The New York Times, in the person of Bosley Crowther, described <em>Moontide</em> as a "ponderously moody film" and that "all of [the cast] need much more than a vague and irresolute script, much more than synthetic scenery and manufactured moods." </p>

<p><em>Moontide</em> spent a bit over three weeks at the Rivoli, with what appears to have been relatively weak box office. It then opened across the country starting in late May. In some cities it did very well, but in others, not so much. Given the big marketing push 20th Century-Fox had put behind Gabin, this mixed box office showing must have been a disappointment. </p>

<p><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>

<p>After filming completed on <em>Moontide</em>, Ida Lupino went virtually immediately back to Warner Bros. to start on <em>The Hard Way</em>, which began in early March. 20th Century-Fox had designs for her as well, with a starring role in <em>The Blind Man's House</em> planned to start in April. (See this <a href="../../../2020/11/blind-mans-house-.html">earlier essay</a> for more on what happened to this project.) </p>

<p>Lupino became severely ill shortly after <em>The Hard Way</em> began and was unable to return to work until early June. Her next film for 20th Century-Fox, filmed in the late summer of 1942 after <em>The Hard Way</em> finally completed, ended up being the drama <em>Life Begins at Eight-Thirty</em> with Monty Woolley.</p>

<p>Gabin's plans at 20th Century-Fox were in flux. Shortly after the premiere of <em>Moontide</em>, he was quoted by Herbert Cohn of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle saying, "You know, I am a Westerns fan. I love them. Someday I want to make one like Hoot Gibson and Tom Mix. Maybe they will let me." That was not in the cards. </p>

<p>As of early in the production of <em>Moontide</em>, his next project was to be a former Tyrone Power swashbuckler <em>Down to the Sea in Ships</em>. As of the completion of <em>Moontide</em>, the plan was a project called <em>The Night the World Shook</em>, which Archie Mayo was assigned to direct thanks to his success working with Gabin. This project did not happen, though—nor did any other for Gabin at Fox over the next year. He spent a  significant amount of  time working at the Hollywood Canteen.</p>

<p>Gabin eventually bought out his Fox contract, made one more Hollywood movie at Universal—directed by fellow Frenchman Jean Renoir—then joined General Charles de Gaulle's Free French forces and was part of the division that liberated Paris in 1944. He eventually resumed his film career in France and became the legend that is known today.</p>

<p><strong>"When will we have another like it?"</strong></p>

<p>To close out the story of the making of <em>Moontide</em>, here is a quote from a theater exhibitor in Columbus, Kansas from the "What the Picture Did for Me" feature in <em>Motion Picture Herald</em> of November, 1942. It fits my own feelings well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the finest entertainments we have played, which went straight to the hearts of all. Jean Gabin's acting marvelous, and this Lupino girl can act rings around many other stars. They're still talking about "Moontide" here and asking when we will have another like it.</p>

                                <p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d7a200d-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d7a200d img-responsive" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Moontide poster" title="Moontide poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d7a200d-200wi" /></a>The movie <em>Moontide</em> (1942) was one of the earliest of Ida Lupino's films that I watched, nearly four years ago. I found it while looking to discover "noir" films, due to its presence in a DVD collection of 20th Century-Fox noir films. </p>

<p><em>Moontide</em> may not be classic noir in its storyline, but it certainly has exceptional noir cinematography. It left a big impression on me—for its touching romance, its tremendous performances, and its unique and memorable atmospherics—dark and claustrophobic despite its mostly-outdoors setting on a foggy bait barge in Los Angeles harbor. </p>

<p><em>Moontide</em> is also notable for being the first of only two American films made by the legendary French film star Jean Gabin.</p>

<p>This is part of a series of posts on the making of that film.</p>

<p><strong>Origins: The novel</strong></p>

<p>The story of <em>Moontide</em> begins with the prolific character actor Willard Robertson. Born in 1886, Robertson began his career as a lawyer, but with a strong interest in writing and acting that led him to switch careers. In the early 1920s, two of his plays were adapted into films. Around 1930, another writing gig brought him out to Hollywood, where, initially out of curiosity, he fell into character acting in small roles. By 1940, a reporter encapsulated Robertson's feelings as, "He has been typed so hard, there is not much pleasure in making pictures, and his only interests are boats, deep-sea fishing and books."</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d88200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d88200d img-responsive" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Willard Robertson in 1933" title="Willard Robertson in 1933" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4262d88200d-200wi" /></a>In the spring of 1940, Robertson was cast as a Mormon elder in the big budget 20th Century-Fox epic <em>Brigham Young</em>, starring Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell and Dean Jagger. The company spent many weeks on location in Utah, the Sierra-Nevada and other locales. Robertson said the only thing to do at nights was to play poker, and he did not like poker. So he retired to his cabin and wrote a novel—his first. That novel became <em>Moon Tide</em>, published in late August 1940, around the time that <em>Brigham Young</em> premiered.</p>

<p>The novel <em>Moon Tide</em> attracted a lot of attention before it was even published. In mid-August, <em>Variety</em> reported that "virtually all major film companies" were interested in the screen rights and that story editors compared the writing to that of John Steinbeck. Reviews of the book published over the next few months were almost uniformly positive. A reviewer in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat wrote, "It is a moving and ironic tale, told with tenderness and commendable restraint." The Chicago Tribune said that the novel "indicates definitely that writing is [Robertson's] natural field."  </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea73a14200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea73a14200c img-responsive" style="width: 145px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Moon Tide novel" title="Moon Tide novel" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea73a14200c-150wi" /></a>A few weeks after the novel's publication, <em>Variety</em> reported that the price for the screen rights had been placed at $25,000, and at some point over the next few months, 20th Century-Fox closed the deal for $30,000. (That is equivalent to well-over half a million dollars in 2020.) Robertson must have been thinking of a screen adaptation early on, as he later said that he had written in a good part for himself. That role, however, would eventually be played by Claude Rains.</p>

<p>After selling his novel, Robertson continued his character acting career. He also found the time to write at least two more novels—"South from Yesterday", published in 1943, and "Oasis", published in 1944. I don't believe either were adapted into films, though 20th Century-Fox appears to have been interested in the former in its early stages, according to a December 1941 item by Oakland Tribune columist Wood Soanes.</p>

<p>On April 5, 1948, Robertson died suddenly in Hollywood at the age of 62. One of his last of his 144 film credits was in the Warner Bros. drama "Deep Valley" (1947), starring Ida Lupino.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The role of the viciously ambitious older sister in <em>The Hard Way</em> (1943) could be considered the pinnacle of Ida Lupino's career as a Hollywood movie star. It is the role for which she received her most prestigious award—Best Actress from the New York Film Critics Circle in 1943.</p>

<p>It is commonly cited that Lupino was given this role after Bette Davis had turned it down. The late film historian and television personality Robert Osborne quotes Davis later expressing regret for that decision: "How did I let that one get away?"</p>

<p>It turns out, though, that Warner Bros. intended <em>The Hard Way</em> to be an Ida Lupino vehicle virtually from the beginning.  So how did Bette Davis have the chance to turn it down? </p>

<p>Let's follow the story.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241b98200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241b98200d img-responsive" style="width: 240px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Ida Lupino in The Hard Way" title="Ida Lupino in The Hard Way" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241b98200d-250wi" /></a>At the time that <em>The Hard Way</em> surfaced as a project for Warner Bros. in mid-1941, Bette Davis was the top dramatic actress on the lot and amongst the most celebrated actresses in Hollywood. Meanwhile, Ida Lupino was a rapidly-rising dramatic star at the same studio, having made a splash a year earlier in a supporting role in <em>They Drive By Night</em>, and then continued her momentum with co-starring roles in <em>High Sierra</em>, <em>The Sea Wolf</em>, and <em>Out of the Fog</em>. Though Warners was her primary studio, Lupino had avoided signing an exclusive contract, and her next project was a starring vehicle—her first—at Columbia called <em>Ladies in Retirement</em>. </p>

<p>Warners had been building up Lupino as a star for nearly a year and was overdue to provide their own starring vehicle for her. According to the initial press reports, <em>The Hard Way</em> would serve that purpose. <em>The Film Daily</em> had an item on June 5, 1941:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Warner Bros. has signed Irwin Shaw, whose "Gentle People" Warners filmed 
  under the title of "Out of the Fog," to prepare the scenario 
  for the Ida Lupino vehicle, "The Hard Way".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next day, Hollywood columnist Louella Parsons wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These heartless, cruel girl roles cannot come too tough for Ida Lupino 
  who doesn't even object to a nice murder now and then—on the screen I mean. 
  So she's greatly intrigued over Jerry Wald's new story, "The Hard Way," 
  which Hal Wallis selects for her as her next for Warners.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These were the first press reports concerning <em>The Hard Way</em> that I have found. Could Bette Davis have been offered the part before this? It is certainly possible, though the evidence, if any, is not public. But Davis <em>was</em> offered the role—publicly—a few months later. </p>

<p>How did Lupino almost lose her first Warners starring vehicle to Bette Davis? </p>

<p>Only July 1, a few weeks after the initial press reports on <em>The Hard Way</em>, and while Lupino was working at Columbia in the final stages of <em>Ladies in Retirement</em>, Warners assigned her to the supporting role of Cassie in <em>King's Row</em>. Lupino strongly resisted this assignment, suggesting, according to William Donati's biography of her, that the part was too small and the billing too low.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241c32200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241c32200d img-responsive" style="width: 380px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Kings Row poster" title="Kings Row poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241c32200d-400wi" /></a>Warner Bros. had severe trouble finding another prominent actress willing to do the role of Cassie. By the end of August, with <em>King's Row</em> well into production, they again pressed Lupino to play Cassie. This time she turned down the role for good, was put on suspension, and left Hollywood for a vacation in New York. Louella Parsons reported that the studio ordered Lupino to report back to the lot at the end of the month for her next part as the title character in <em>Juke Girl</em>—"or else".</p>

<p>Clearly, the Warners-Lupino relationship was in the dumps after the <em>King's Row</em> dispute. On her New York City trip. Lupino talked to the press about how she loved the city, but would "probably" return to Hollywood because she was looking forward to doing <em>Moontide</em> at 20th Century-Fox with Jean Gabin. Left unsaid was that she was not pleased with the <em>Juke Girl</em> role Warners expected her to do, and that she and the studio executives were in another bitter dispute.</p>

<p>On September 18, <em>Film Daily</em> reported that "Warner Bros. would like to have Ginger Rogers for the lead in Irwin Shaw's <em>The Hard Way</em>". No other details were included. Was this for the younger sister role eventually played by Joan Leslie or Lupino's role as the older sister? In either case, <em>The Hard Way</em> would no longer have been an Ida Lupino vehicle.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea52a1a200c-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea52a1a200c img-responsive" style="width: 380px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Juke Girl poster" title="Juke Girl poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea52a1a200c-400wi" /></a>The Warners-Lupino situation again blew up in the press two weeks later. On October 4, as Lupino was returning to Hollywood by train, Louella Parsons reported that Lupino had rejected <em>Juke Girl</em> and taken another suspension.  </p>

<p>The same day, in what cannot be a coincidence, <em>Film Bulletin</em> wrote, "Formerly scheduled for Ida Lupino, <em>The Hard Way</em> has been tossed Bette Davis' way." </p>

<p>Warners was apparently so displeased with Lupino turning down two successive assignments, that they were playing hardball by taking away her first starring vehicle for them. According to the Donati bio, Warners also threatened to cancel Lupino's contact.</p>

<p>Ten days later, Louella Parsons wrote that the studio was trying to assemble a superstar cast of Davis, Ginger Rogers, and Cary Grant for the film, saying "it is more than wishful thinking", though salaries alone would make it extremely expensive. Wishful thinking it was, though. It must have been at this point that Bette Davis turned down <em>The Hard Way</em>.</p>

<p>After mid-October, press reports on <em>The Hard Way</em> go quiet. Donati wrote that the tension between Warners and Lupino eased when Warners allowed her to participate in a sequence of the ensemble film <em>Forever and a Day</em> at RKO. Her chapter of the film appears to have been filmed in early November. Shortly after this, she reported to 20th Century-Fox to begin work on <em>Moontide</em> opposite the French star Jean Gabin. <em>Moontide</em> would occupy her into February.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241be6200d-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241be6200d img-responsive" style="width: 380px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="The Hard Way poster" title="The Hard Way poster" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026be4241be6200d-400wi" /></a>Meanwhile, Warner Bros. was moving ahead with <em>The Hard Way</em>, assigning Vincent Sherman as director and working on script revisions. By late November, Warners and Lupino were presumably back on good terms, as she was announced as the star in a new project, albeit one that never came to fruition. </p>

<p>Presumably it was at this time that Warner Bros. put Lupino back in <em>The Hard Way</em>. She was enthusiastic about the revised script she received in December. </p>

<p>And so, as Donati put it, her career crisis at Warner Bros. had ended. Just after the new year, the press was reporting that Warners would claim Lupino back for <em>The Hard Way</em> after <em>Moontide</em> completed. Indeed, she started on <em>The Hard Way</em> in early March 1942.</p>

<p>Of course, by that time, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had happened and the United States was at war. Other crises were at hand.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>While Ida Lupino was working on the film <em>Moontide</em> at 20th Century-Fox in early 1942, she was reported to be cast in the lead role for another project at that studio, <em>Blind Man's House</em>. Of course, there is no such movie on her filmography because this project never came to fruition. But, with or without Ida, 20th Century-Fox seems to have tried several times over the course of three years to get it off the ground. </p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e973e868200b-pi"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e20263e973e868200b img-responsive" style="width: 180px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="Hugh Walpole" title="Hugh Walpole" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e20263e973e868200b-100wi" /></a>The story begins with the British writer Hugh Walpole, who was a best-selling author over the 1920s and '30s. He completed <em>Blind Man's House</em> in 1941, and 20th Century-Fox purchased the movie rights before it was published. As early as January 27, 1941, the trade papers discussed the purchase and indicated that a screenplay was being prepared for the '41-'42 season. Walpole died of a hearth attack on June 1, age 57, after over-exerting himself in a war fund-raising drive—not living to see the publication of <em>Blind Man's House</em> in August.</p>

<p>The book appears to have been well-received. The reviewer for the New York Daily News wrote, "Hugh Walpole's last book before he died is one of the best that he has written in some time, and a fitting close to the career of one of the ablest and most prolific writers of modern England. It is the story of Julius Cromwell, who was blinded in the last war, and his young and pretty wife, Celia, who loves him with a possessive passion." A reviewer for the Chicago Daily Tribune wrote, "'The Blind Man's House' is one of those lesser works of a great novelist—infinitely better than the best work of a poor novelist. ... There is an ominousness about the tale from the beginning. But it is a gentle shadow rather than a really tragic one which falls upon the blind man's house and the quiet little English village. ... Incidentally, 'The Blind Man's House' is highly beguiling—just the thing to keep your mind insulated against the world and the weather."</p>

<p>The movie project receded behind the scenes, re-emerging in the press in early January, 1942. At that point, the role in <em>Blind Man's House</em> was mentioned by a columnist as "one of the most important feminine roles now on schedule at 20th Century-Fox", and that the 18-year-old Anne Baxter, not yet a star, was up for the role against Ida Lupino, a nine-year Hollywood veteran who was approaching her 24th birthday and had established herself as a star two years earlier. Just a few days later, Baxter vanishes as Hedda Hopper wrote that <em>Blind Man's House</em> would star Ida Lupino, with the adaptation to be done by R. C. Sherriff.</p>

<p>At the time this hit the press, Ida was filming <em>Moontide</em> at 20th Century-Fox opposite Jean Gabin. Her primary studio, though, was Warner Bros., and they had their own project lined up for her—<em>The Hard Way</em>. It had been nearly a year since she had worked on a film at Warners, as she had turned down a few roles. She was eager to get back on good terms with Warners, so in early March, soon after <em>Moontide</em> finished production, Ida was working on <em>The Hard Way</em>.</p>

<p>A few days earlier, the New York Times reported that <em>Blind Man's House</em> was scheduled to start in April with Lupino in the lead role. I'm not sure how long production on <em>The Hard Way</em> was scheduled for if things had gone well, but it seems possible that Ida could have gone on to do <em>Blind Man's House</em> without a major delay. </p>

<p>But things did not go well on <em>The Hard Way</em>. </p>

<p>In mid-March, Ida collapsed on the set. She was ill for several weeks with what was variously reported as influenza, strep throat, and, later, "run down condition". Warners postponed <em>The Hard Way</em> until Ida had sufficiently recovered, which took nearly two months. </p>

<p>Sometime in the interim, 20th Century-Fox appears to have given up on the idea of Ida Lupino starring in <em>Blind Man's House</em>. The last mention of Ida's name in the press in connection with the project came on March 10, just a couple days before her collapse.</p>

<p><a class="asset-img-link"  style="float: right;" href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea14377200c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea14377200c img-responsive" style="width: 280px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" alt="The Blind Man's House book cover" title="The Blind Man's House book cover" src="../../../../.a/6a00d83451ffec69e2026bdea14377200c-200wi" /></a>At this same time, Fox assigned Fritz Lang to direct <em>Blind Man's House</em> and Milton Sperling to produce. As of late March, according to industry columnist Edwin Schallert, it was still on track to start in late April. By late April, the picture had not started, but George Sanders was cast in the leading role, with Linda Darnell set for the heroine role in place of Ida. A few weeks later, a new director was assigned—John Stahl.</p>

<p>Still no action, as two more months pass. By mid-July, Louella Parsons reported that George Sanders was taken off the project due to his "sarcastic quips on and off screen", and that Fox was negotiating to borrow Walter Pidgeon from M-G-M. Maureen O'Hara was now on track for Ida's old role, though O'Hara was reportedly about to have a major operation. Variety wrote that the film was now scheduled to start on August 18.</p>

<p>Nothing happened in August. By late September, the trade papers reported that director Stahl would begin "producing-directing" on <em>Blind Man's House</em> after he completed his current project, <em>The Immortal Sergeant</em>. Negotiations for Pidgeon had apparently not yet been successful, but the studio was still hoping to get him.</p>

<p>Several more months pass with nothing happening. In February, 1943, Hedda Hopper wrote that Pidgeon was still being sought for the top role in <em>Blind Man's House</em>, but he would have to wait until he could shave off the beard he was wearing while doing <em>Madame Curie</em>. Maureen O'Hara was again mentioned as the co-star.</p>

<p>Another half-year of nothing. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, <em>Showmen's Trade Review</em> reported that Ida Lupino had been signed by 20th Century-Fox to star in <em>Blind Man's House</em>, which would now be called <em>House of Chadworth</em>. Otto Preminger would produce, and it was expected to start in November, "as one of the most important pictures on the schedule." One paper reported that William Eythe would be the male lead opposite Ida.</p>

<p>For such an important picture, with the big names of Lupino and Preminger attached, I would have expected it to be far more widely reported. But it was not. I have a feeling any deal fell through before it was completed. </p>

<p>Four more months passed with nothing in the press about either <em>Blind Man's House</em> or <em>House of Chadworth</em>. Then, in January 1944, an AP report claimed that Charles Bickford was to play the top role in <em>Blind Man's House</em>. This is the last significant mention of either <em>Blind Man's House</em> or <em>House of Chadworth</em> that I have found. At this point, after three years, 20th Century-Fox appears to have finally given up on the Walpole project.</p>

<p>A footnote that may or not be related: The Charles Bickford mention as the blind character brought to my mind the later film <em>Woman on the Beach</em> (1947)—starring Joan Bennett and Robert Ryan—directed by Jean Renoir at RKO a few years later. That story also involves a blind man with a younger, attractive wife, and jealousy over another man. With minimal research, I haven't found a concrete connection between the Walpole novel and that movie, however, so perhaps this is just a surface similarity. </p>
