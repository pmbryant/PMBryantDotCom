The archive of my political writings from 2004 into 2012 at my soon-to-be-defunct Typepad blog, "B and B," 
is online here. Begun in late 2004 during the heat of the very consequential Bush-Kerry election battle, 
it enjoyed eight years of activity and another thirteen years of passive surivival. 
Enjoy the look back in time.
