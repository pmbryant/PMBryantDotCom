		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>As you may recall, there was a hotly-contested city council election in the small town of Helotes, just northwest of San Antonio, back in May.&nbsp; The main issue was the <a href="../03/helotes_heritag.html">proposed development</a> of a Wal-Mart Supercenter at an environmentally- and scenically-sensitive location, at the corner of Highway 16 and Scenic Loop Road.&nbsp; In the end, three Wal-Mart-supporting incumbents were <a href="../05/san_antonio_vot.html">ousted</a> by three Wal-Mart-opposing candidates.&nbsp; In two cases, the margin, after a recount, was a mere <a href="../05/victory_of_walm.html">7 votes</a> (out of around 1300).</p>

<p>Now, the two incumbents who lost by that margin are <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/neighbors/stories/MYSA062905.1H.NW.lawsuit.13860a58.html">filing a lawsuit</a> over the results:</p><blockquote><p><em>Saying it's just something that has to be done, former Helotes Mayor Steve Hodges and former Councilman Pat Wootton are contesting the results of the May 7 election in court.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>A recount showed both lost their seats by seven votes, but in a petition submitted June 23 and naming Mayor Jon Allan and Councilman Stuart Birnbaum as contestees, Hodges and Wootton allege a number of people who voted weren't eligible because they didn't live in the city at the time or were convicted felons. They also contend others were turned away who should have been allowed to vote.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>...
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Birnbaum was out of town and didn't return phone calls, but Allan called the move a &quot;huge mistake.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;We had a difficult election and we have a lot of things on our plate, including Wal-Mart,&quot; Allan said. &quot;To contest the election is just going to reopen wounds. The thing we need to be able to do in this city is bring people together, and this is not the way to do it.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Among other things, the petition states there is evidence that election officials or others involved in the administration of the election &quot;prevented eligible voters from voting, failed to count legal votes and/or engaged in other fraud or illegal conduct or made mistakes.&quot; This affected the election outcome, the suit states.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>It calls for another election if the &quot;true&quot; outcome of the election can't be determined.
</em></p>

<p>
<em> &quot;I think we've come up with enough inconsistencies of the records of people who voted,&quot; Wootton said. &quot;I'm not saying there's any intentional fraud, but there's enough questionable voters out there that maybe shouldn't have voted. We want to make sure everything is on the up-and-up.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>This is becoming reminiscent of the <a href="../../2004/11/mysacom_metro_s.html">Vo-Heflin</a> fight half a year ago over a Texas House seat from the Houston area.&nbsp; Talmadge Heflin, the entrenched Republican incumbent, lost to newcomer Democrat Hubert Vo, by 32 votes, and had a very hard time accepting that he lost.&nbsp; He made many allegations similar to those being forwarded by Hodges and Wooten in Helotes.&nbsp; He even had the advantage of being able to mount his election challenged in a state House controlled by his own party.&nbsp; Yet he still <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004897.html#004897">failed</a>.</p>

<p>So it would appear that the chances that the Wal-Mart supporters will overturn the election of Allan and Birnbaum in Helotes are slim to none.&nbsp; And note that the margin of seven votes is over half of a percent and so, while small, is not quite as razor-thin as it might first appear.</p>

<p>That is more than Al Gore won by in 2000, after all.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The latest edition of <a href="http://tangledbank.net">Tangled Bank</a> is up, produced by New Zealander David Winter at the blog <a href="https://science_boy.blogspot.com/2005/06/31st-meeting-of-tangled-bank-society.html">Science and Sensibility</a>.&nbsp; It includes a &quot;Bryant double feature,&quot; for what that's worth, as my post on <a href="ocean_vector_wi.html">Ocean Winds</a> as well as my post on the <a href="new_earthlike_p.html">Earth-like planet that is not like Earth</a> were both included.&nbsp; (The former survived a glitch that prevented it from being included in the previous edition of Tangled Bank.)</p>

<p>As I resolved earlier, I will try to highlight a couple articles.&nbsp; One is easy, since I actually read it a couple days ago.&nbsp; It is from an ecologist at the blog <a href="http://nuthatch.typepad.com/ba/2005/06/invisible_birds.html">bootstrap analysis</a> and tells us more about one of this blog's favorite birds, the &quot;invisible&quot; yellow-billed cuckoo.&nbsp; Read it to learn about &quot;exploding feathers&quot; and more.&nbsp; If you look closely you may even find a comment at that blog from a familiar voice detailing a brief story of a close encounter with one of these beautiful birds.</p>

<p>Another is from a blog I was not familiar with until now, called <a href="http://bearcastle.com/blog/?p=206">Bearcastle Blog</a>, and is about how scientists struggle to convey the importance of their work.&nbsp; In the end, he comes up with a good, if not ideal, metaphor of a &quot;house of technology&quot; built on a &quot;foundation of science.&quot;&nbsp; I say 'not ideal' because I believe there is plenty of worthwhile science that doesn't contribute at all to the &quot;house of technology,&quot; and also because science and the knowledge gained by it has applications far beyond technological ones.&nbsp; But that is another story.&nbsp; Go to this edition of <a href="https://science_boy.blogspot.com/2005/06/31st-meeting-of-tangled-bank-society.html">Tangled Bank</a> and read his argument first hand, as well as all the other fascinating essays there.</p>

<p>By the way, this blog will have the honor of hosting the 36th edition of Tangled Bank (if I counted right) on September 7.&nbsp; Stay tuned.&nbsp; This <a href="https://girlscientist.blogspot.com/2005/03/how-i-hosted-tangled-bank.html">post</a> by Hedwig the Owl at Living the Scientific Life will no doubt be a very handy reference for me.</p>

                                <p>Express-News columnist Roddy Stinson is once again playing up the idea that the San Antonio city council strongly resembles that of <a href="berkeley_deep_i.html">Berkeley</a>.&nbsp; &quot;The similarities are eerie,&quot; he <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/rstinson/stories/MYSA062605.3A.stinson.9eaed7c.html">writes</a>, before launching into a step-by-step comparison of &quot;BERKELEY WEST&quot;—the famous one, in northern California—and &quot;BERKELEY SOUTHWEST&quot;—the new nickname for the Alamo city that Stinson coined a mere two weeks ago in a <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/columnists/stories/MYSA061205.3A.stinson.305344313.html">previous column</a>.</p>

<p>I find the case less than compelling, but I hope that, if Stinson decides to keep pursing this angle, he takes out a map of North America.&nbsp; My former home of Hololulu may arguably be labelled &quot;BERKELEY SOUTHWEST.&quot;&nbsp; But not the home of Phil Hardberger.</p>

<p>If he dislikes using the word &quot;southeast&quot;—and I can understand that many Texans would have a natural aversion to any word with &quot;east&quot; in it—perhaps he can label San Antonio instead as AUSTIN SOUTHWEST or BOSTON SOUTHWEST or even OTTAWA SOUTHWEST.&nbsp; After all, from Stinson's point of view, those Canadians no doubt have plenty of their own surplus-spending, noise-abating, artist-supporting tendencies.</p>

                                <p>We attended the first San Antonio Blogfest on Saturday and had a blast meeting fellow bloggers, of all political stripes.&nbsp; Ranten N. Raven and his wife did the heavy lifting in organizing this event.&nbsp; He has a report, including photos, at <a href="http://www.robinjuhl.homelinux.net/weblog/pivot/entry.php?id=628">The View from the Nest</a>.&nbsp; Alas, no one seems to have captured a picture of their teenage son plastering Raven with a water balloon or two.&nbsp; Mike Thomas, who was there with his wife and young son, also has a report at <a href="https://rhetoricrhythm.blogspot.com/2005/06/alamo-city-blogfest-2005.html">Rhetoric &amp; Rhythm</a>, while Roscoe Ellis has some photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roscoe/sets/498993/">here</a> and also at his LiveJournal blog <a href="http://arellis49.livejournal.com/">here</a>.</p>



<p>It was a great pleasure and honor meeting all of them, as well as Eddie Rodriguez from <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/">The Red State</a> and Julia Hayden (Sgt Mom) from <a href="http://www.sgtstryker.com/">The Daily Brief</a>.&nbsp; Alas, we arrived just a bit too late to meet Matt from <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com">Just Another Blog</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the combustible ideological mix (which seems extremely unusual, if not unique, amongst gatherings organized over the internet), it all seems to have come off quite well.&nbsp; I am looking forward to a second installment, perhaps later this year.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Will there be a &quot;Bush Plan&quot; to get Iraq out of its currently <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2005/06/24/hope_eludes_baghdad_residents/">troubled situation</a> and <a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2005-06-24T214431Z_01_KNE478258_RTRUKOC_0_IRAQ-USA.xml">back on its feet</a>?</p><blockquote><p><em>[Iraq Prime Minister Ibrahim al-] Jaafari pressed for a long-term U.S. commitment for assistance to help with reconstruction and debt relief.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;We
hope that Mr. Bush will try to redo a Marshall Plan, calling it the
Bush plan, to help Iraq, to help the Iraqi people. And this would be a
very wonderful step that they stand beside us,&quot; he said. He was
referring to the U.S. investment plan for helping rebuild Europe after
World War Two.</em></p></blockquote><p>What does the White House think of that idea?&nbsp; From today's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050624-3.html">press briefing</a> by Press Secretary Scott McClellan:</p><blockquote><p><em> Q&nbsp; &nbsp; The Prime Minister talked about perhaps a Bush Plan, likening
it to the Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Europe after World War II.
And when the President was asked about reconstruction, he said of
course, the U.S. is devoting resources, but the job belongs to the
Iraqi people.&nbsp; Is there a different outlook between the Iraq Prime
Minister and the President about the building of infrastructure?
</em></p>

<p><em> MR. McCLELLAN:&nbsp; Well, I'll let him talk further about what he was
talking about.&nbsp; But if you'll recall, there was an international
conference earlier this week, more than 80 nations coming together to
show their strong support for the Iraqi people.&nbsp; The international
community is standing with the Iraqi people, and they talked about in
their meetings -- both in the Oval Office and in the residence during
the lunch -- about the importance of the international community
continuing to support the Iraqi people and the transitional government
as they move forward on this historic transformation that is taking
place.&nbsp; And we've been, as the Prime Minister pointed out, providing
tremendous support from the United States for the Iraqi people.
</em></p>

<p><em> One issue that I imagine will continue to come up is the issue of
debt relief.&nbsp; And there's a donor's conference coming up in Jordan here
shortly, as the President talked about.&nbsp; So I think you're seeing that
the international community is sending a strong message of support for
the transitional government and for the Iraqi people.&nbsp; There are a
number that have come forward with commitments, there are a number that
have made commitments --&nbsp; and we hope that they will move forward
quickly to fulfill those commitments, because it's vital that we
continue to stand with the Iraqi people as they move forward to meet
their political objectives, which they are doing.&nbsp; The President talked
about that.</em></p></blockquote><p>As best I can figure, that's a longwinded, polite brush off.&nbsp; He said, is essence, 'Others are taking care of it.'&nbsp; So Iraqis should not expect much leadership from the Bush administration on this issue.</p>

Abizaid, said that more foreign fighters were coming into Iraq and that
the insurgency's &quot;overall strength is about the same&quot; as it was six
months ago. &quot;There's a lot of work to be done against the insurgency,&quot;
he added.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N22675120.htm">CIA says Iraq is now a terrorist training ground</a>
&nbsp; </strong> </p>

<p><em>WASHINGTON, June 22 (Reuters) - The CIA believes the Iraq insurgency
poses an international threat and may produce better-trained Islamic
terrorists than the 1980s Afghanistan war that gave rise to Osama bin
Laden and al Qaeda, a U.S. counterterrorism official said on Wednesday.
<br /><br />A classified report from the U.S. spy agency says Iraqi and foreign
fighters are developing a broad range of deadly skills, from car
bombings and assassinations to tightly coordinated conventional attacks
on police and military targets, the official said.<br /></em></p></blockquote><p>If ever a President and his entire cabinet deserved to be impeached, it is now.&nbsp; This goes beyond corruption—all the way to incompetence—and is a true life-and-death matter.</p>

<p>The only conceivable way the Republican Congress would ever consider such an action is with tremendous pressure from the people who voted them into office.&nbsp; So, until November 2006, this is in in the hands of grassroots Republicans.&nbsp; Will they hold their leaders accountable?&nbsp; Or will they join Rove in shifting blame to their fellow Americans?</p>

                                <p>The Supreme Court issued a controversial, 5-4, decision today on whether local governments can seize private property under eminent domain and hand the property over to a private entity for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/23/AR2005062300783.html">economic development</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em><nitf></nitf><p>The Supreme Court today effectively expanded the right of
local governments to seize private property under eminent domain,
ruling that people's homes and businesses -- even those not considered
blighted -- can be taken against their will for private development if
the seizure serves a broadly defined &quot;public use.&quot;</p></em></p>

<p><em><nitf></nitf><p>In
a 5-4 decision [in the Kelo v. New London, Conn. case], the court upheld the ability of New London, Conn., to
seize people's homes to make way for an office, residential and retail
complex supporting a new $300 million research facility of the Pfizer
pharmaceutical company. The city had argued that the project served a
public use within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution because it would increase tax revenues,
create jobs and improve the local economy.</p></em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The immediate impact of this decision is disquieting.&nbsp; Why should governments have the power to seize people's homes?&nbsp; But governments do have that power, written right into the <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am5">Fifth Amendment</a>:&nbsp; &quot;nor shall private property be taken for public use, without
just compensation.&quot;&nbsp; So as long as just compensation is provided and that the takings is for public use, governments can apparently seize whatever they want—at least under the Constitution.&nbsp; And they've been doing so since the days of the founding fathers.</p>

<p>The real issue in this case was who gets to determine what is a &quot;public use&quot;:&nbsp; elected legislative bodies? or the courts?</p>

<p>The decision by the majority of the Supreme Court is, as I see it, a fundamentally <em>non-activist</em> decision.&nbsp; &nbsp;In determining what a &quot;public use&quot; is, the Supreme Court deferred to the judgement of elected officials.&nbsp; Legislative bodies more closely represent the people, and thus should be in better tune to what constitutes an appropriate public use.<br /> </p><blockquote><p><em>Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens said the case
turned on the question of whether New London's development plan served
a &quot;public purpose.&quot; He added, &quot;Without exception, our cases have
defined that concept broadly, reflecting our longstanding policy of
deference to legislative judgments in this field.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>The four justices in the minority supported an <em>activist</em> decision, that would have the unelected courts imposing their view of &quot;public use.&quot;&nbsp; Who were those four?&nbsp; The three conservative heroes—Scalia, Rehnquist, and Thomas—together with usual swing justice Sandra Day O'Connor.&nbsp; (Today the swing justice was Anthony Kennedy, who supported with the four more liberal members of the Court in issuing their non-activist decision.)</p>



<p>I have a hard time seeing how this case is much different, on the surface, from using eminent domain for urban renewal.&nbsp; And so today's decision is just a reaffirmation of the <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1105968938077">fifty-year old decision</a> that permitted that.&nbsp; If anything, today's decision made eminent domain a more equitable process, since now government can seize the land of more than just poor people.&nbsp; (If local governments abuse their broad powers of eminent domain, there are plenty of ways this can be dealt with, as discussed in section III of this <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/gelpi/takings/courts/documents/APA-Keloamicusbrief_000.pdf">amicus brief</a> from the American Planning Association.)</p>

<p>The <em>Kelo v. New London</em> opinions illustrate how conservative jurists are the true judicial activists these days.&nbsp; I certainly do not want Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas and their ilk deciding what is an appropriate public use.</p>

<p>UPDATE (6:11 P.M.):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/003105.shtml">Nathan Newman</a> explains further why this was a very reasonable decision.</p>

<p>UPDATE (6-24, 12:16 P.M.):&nbsp; More reasoned opinions on the Kelo decision from <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/6/24/13026/7261">Matt Yglesias</a> and <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/takings_and_the.html">Scott Lemieux</a>.&nbsp; In particular, Matt Y. writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>If America wasn't a totalitarian dystopia yesterday, then it isn't
going to be one tomorrow in light of this ruling. Nothing has changed.
Perhaps you think it's </em>bad<em> that nothing has changed, but it's not really the moment to start pulling your hair out. It probably </em><em>is
the moment to start paying closer attention to City Council elections
which many people, myself included, tend not to scrutinize much. Those
people have real power and it's worth paying attention.</em></p></blockquote>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A recent op-ed in the San Antonio Express-News argued for <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/stories/MYSA062005.5B.Levincomment.1c76b25b.html">lowering the bar</a> for passing new amendments to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; The author's rationale?&nbsp; To solve the controversy over control of the judicial branch.</p><blockquote><p><em>
The controversy that now embroils our judiciary is a result of judges 
effectively amending the Constitution to create new rights, like abortion. While reading out of the Constitution rights specifically enumerated, such as the right to bear arms, some might say these changes are positive and reflect the evolution of public opinion, but if they had been made through the formal amendment process rather than by judges, a judge's political views would be irrelevant and judicial selection would be a noncontroversial task of finding the best lawyers to faithfully interpret the Constitution as if it were a contract.</em></p></blockquote><p>The author, Marc A. Levin, while merely described as &quot;an attorney in Austin&quot; in his tag, is a <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2004-06-04/pols_feature3.html">conservative activist</a> and heavily involved with pro-corporate <a href="http://www.texaspolicy.com/staff_member.php?staff_id=32">think</a> <a href="http://www.politicalusa.com/columnists/levin/default.htm">tanks</a>.&nbsp; From his article, he clearly would like to see new amendments of a conservative bent.&nbsp; Presumably the Equal Rights Amendment is not high on his priority list.</p>

<p>While there might be a reasonable argument for making it easier to amend the Constitution, Levin's particular argument strikes me as half-baked.&nbsp; Even if there were a problem such as the author claims, it would not be solved by adding new amendments to the Constitution.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Activist judges, whoever and whereever they may be, would still be able to &quot;create new rights.&quot;&nbsp; Or, as I would put it, activist judges would still be able to invalidate corporate regulations based on archaic readings of the Constitution.&nbsp; By definition, &quot;activist&quot; judges are not restrained by the text in the Constitution and its amendments.</p>

<p>Levin goes on to argue that since so few amendments have been passed in recent decades,&nbsp; the process is simply too hard.&nbsp; But there are twenty-seven amendments, so clearly it is not impossible.&nbsp; Perhaps the lack of recent successful amendments is a symptom that most of the country is satisfied with the Constitution in its current form?</p>

<p>Despite the occasional, lamentable, failure of worthwhile amendments, such as the Equal Rights Amendment, I believe that the difficulty of amending the U.S. Constitution—and the stability thereby provided—is one of the reasons why our Constitution has been so successful.&nbsp; Adopting Levin's proposal would make it easier for temporary political majorities to work their will with the fundamental document of our nation.&nbsp; One decade abortion is a constitutional right; the next it is not.&nbsp; One decade corporations have extensive constitutional protections; the next they do not.&nbsp; Fundamental human and civil rights could be taken away, then given back, then taken away again.&nbsp; Think of the alcohol-prohibition amendment in 1919 and its repeal in 1933, but with many more issues and much more often.<br /> </p>

<p>Respect for the Constitution would gradually wither.&nbsp; The result would be quite detrimental to the long-term survival of our Constitutional republic.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I read a story that should be of interest to birders and others interested in nature in the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA061805.1B.bird_relocation.1d6d1f62.html">San Antonio Express-News</a> over the weekend.&nbsp; Swallows have artfully adapted to using human structures on which to build their homes.&nbsp; But what happens when the humans decide that a particular structure, still useful to the swallows, has outlived its usefulness to the humans?</p><blockquote><p><em>
As their parents zoomed about in apparent confusion and distress, almost 100 young cave swallows and eggs were removed from a doomed highway overpass and resettled by wildlife specialists on Friday.
</em></p>

<p>
<em> Many of the baby birds had just hatched. They seemed to be all mouth atop tiny, pink fuzzy bodies. Others were fully feathered and looked ready to leave their nests. The white and speckled eggs were only a little larger than jelly beans.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Wildlife specialists placed the offspring in shoeboxes and drove them to a nearby highway bridge where they were inserted into the nests of other cave swallows, which took to them as if they were their own. Four of the fledglings opted to fly off rather than be raised by foster parents.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>...
</em></p>

<p>
<em> The rush to demolish the westbound and eastbound lanes of Loop 410 where it rises over South Zarzamora Street ruffled a few feathers.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Lynn Cuny, executive director of Wildlife Rescue &amp; Rehabilitation, a nonprofit wildlife rescue agency out of Kendalia that led the relocation effort, questioned the state's decision to evict the birds rather than hold off for a few weeks.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;We tried to get the project to wait until the birds moved themselves,&quot; she said. &quot;This is going to be a real sad day for these birds because they're losing their families.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Cuny said her group was the only one in the region authorized to handle federally protected migratory birds and has never before been asked by the state to move any.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;It's scary to think how many times this has happened where the bridges went down with the babies in the nest,&quot; she said.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Angela Grimes, the wildlife rescue agency's operations director, said the toughest part was watching one pair of swallow parents perch right where their nest had been.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Grimes imagined what must have been running through their minds: &quot;'They were just here. Where are my babies?' That's what is so wrong about this.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The rescue group doesn't expect the baby birds to be reunited with their parents. 
</em></p></blockquote><p>For fellow bird lovers, it seems distressing that this would be done at a time when the swallows are raising their young, but I get that impression that for any consideration at all to be given to birds during overpass work of this sort is new.&nbsp; And for this new concern, we can apparently thank Valerie Collins, a wildlife biologist hired by the Texas Department of Transportation.</p>

<p></p><blockquote><p><em>
Collins said she took a lot of guff from colleagues and others over her insistence that no swallows be killed.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;I'm a laughingstock,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm the bird lady.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Collins said that whenever an overpass is set for destruction, netting or a special kind of barbed wire should be put up to force the swallows, which habitually return to the same nesting site each year, to build their little nests of mud elsewhere.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Collins said she hopes state employees and others learned a lesson.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;If this is a big pain, then maybe they'll do it right next time,&quot; she said. </em></p></blockquote>
