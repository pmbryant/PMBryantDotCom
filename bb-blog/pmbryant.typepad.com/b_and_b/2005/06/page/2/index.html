		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Some good news for the weekend.&nbsp; In California's central valley, an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/wire/sns-ap-songbirds-return,1,5527407.story?coll=sns-ap-science-headlines">endangered songbird</a> is making a comeback and showing up in places it hasn't been seen in decades, thanks to efforts at land restoration:</p><blockquote><p><em>FRESNO, Calif. -- A chatty songbird thought to have disappeared from
the Central Valley 60 years ago has been spotted nesting in a patch of
restored habitat along the San Joaquin River. <br /><br />The
least Bell's vireo, a little gray songbird that fits in a closed fist,
was once widespread in the Central Valley. It disappeared from the area
as the riparian habitat it favors was ripped up to make way for
development and agriculture. About 90 percent of the valley's historic
riverside vegetation has been lost, said Al Donner, spokesman for the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<br /><br />The bird was put on the federal endangered species list in 1986, when
there were only about 300 pairs left in the low-lying shrubbery along
creeks and streams in southern California.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Dropping her equipment, [seasonal biologist for the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge, Linette] Lina focused her binoculars on the bird -- a
male perched on a branch about 30 feet away, singing and shaking his
tail feathers. As she called her supervisor about the discovery, a
female joined him and did a copulation dance. <br /><br />Further
investigation showed the nesting pair was feeding two baby birds, which
were just learning to fly, said Lina, who does bird counts and
observation for the Point Reyes Bird Observatory Conservation Science.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The area where they were found had been a ranch, which was bought in
1998 and restored over the last three years by Fish and Wildlife with
help from the state of California.</em></p></blockquote><p>It must be immensely satisfying for these biologists to see the fruits of the efforts of years of hard restoration work.</p>

<p>A blog called <a href="http://www.faultline.org/place/toad/archive/2005_06.html">Toad in the Hole</a> has an email from a couple days ago from
within the federal Fish &amp; Wildlife Service announcing this
discovery.&nbsp; Also, <a href="https://girlscientist.blogspot.com/">Hedwig</a> has a pointer to this story in her current edition of <a href="https://girlscientist.blogspot.com/2005/06/birds-in-news-15.html">Birds in the News</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.umich.edu/~esupdate/library/97.07-08/contents.html"><img width="100" height="63" border="0" src="../../../../images/leastbellsvireoumich_1.jpg" title="Leastbellsvireoumich_1" alt="Leastbellsvireoumich_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>As a result of the destruction of much of their riparian habitat over the latter half of the twentieth century, least Bell's vireos had been confined to <a href="http://www.werc.usgs.gov/sandiego/flycat.html">southern California</a>—in particular the Camp Pendleton area in San Diego County.&nbsp; Habitat loss and also nest-parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds reduced the vireos numbers into the hundreds by the mid-1980s.</p>

<p>Fortunately, efforts to <a href="https://pacific.fws.gov/news/1998/9850nr.htm">control cowbirds</a> and preserve and restore habitat have increased the numbers of least Bell's vireos to <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2005/02/28/special_reports/science_technology/10_12_222_26_05.txt">around 3000</a> these days.&nbsp; And with that increase, they have been expanding back north into their former range.&nbsp; So perhaps this exciting discovery in the central valley should not be all that surprising.</p>

<p>For those who aren't familiar with cowbirds, here is a description of their <a href="http://www.audubon.org/bird/research/">parasitic behavior</a> from the Audubon Society:</p><blockquote><p><em>Instead of building their own nests, incubating their own eggs and
raising their own nestlings, Brown-headed Cowbirds have a different
breeding strategy. Cowbird females use other bird species as hosts --
laying their eggs in the nests of other bird species and relying on
these hosts to incubate and raise their chicks.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Brown-headed Cowbirds occupy most of North America south of the Arctic,
but this large range has occurred only recently and is the result of
human-induced factors. Prior to the arrival of Europeans in North
America, cowbirds were nomadic, following the large herds of bison that
roamed across the Great Plains.</em></p></blockquote><p>When their nests are parasitized, tiny vireos and other songbird parents end up feeding chicks bigger than they are.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, cowbirds are a major problem for far more bird species than just the least Bell's vireo.&nbsp; For instance, here in central Texas, they are a major reason why the black-capped vireo is an endangered species.</p>

<p>But for today at least, we can celebrate the least Bell's vireo return to its old home in California's central valley.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Blogger and D.C. politico Matthew Yglesias has <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/6/16/13119/3070">arrived in Texas</a>—Fort Worth specifically—for apparently the first time in his still young life:</p><blockquote><p><em>My flight got in an hour earlier than I thought it would thanks to the time zone change (like a typical east coast elitist, I think I subconciously assumed there was just a big leap from Eastern Time to Pacific Time somewhere over the rockies) and so far the very small portion of the Metroplex I've seen utterly fails to live up to stereotype. DFW airport looks like . . . an airport! The Fort Worth suburbs driven through en route to downtown look like . . . suburbs! Downtown Fort Worth seems lovely, nobody says &quot;howdy!&quot; (n.b., my Texas-born roommate is constantly saying &quot;howdy!&quot;) or wears outlandish hats. Main difference is that the Starbucks has SBC WiFi instead of TMobile WiFi. Also, the coffee is substantially cheaper than in NYC, DC, or Boston.<br /><br />...</em></p>

<p><em>I'm beginning to think this whole Red versus Blue thing is even more all hype than it obviously was already. </em></p></blockquote><p>While I'm happy to see Matt debunking the &quot;whole <a href="../../../../2004/11/abandon_all_tal.html">Red</a> versus <a href="../../../../2004/11/yet_another_rea.html">Blue</a> thing,&quot; his impression of Texas is going to be very superficial if he sticks to airports, suburbs, and Starbucks.&nbsp; To get a broader view,&nbsp; albeit one still lacking in outlandish hats, perhaps he should travel on down here to San Antonio—or as one <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/rstinson/stories/MYSA061205.3A.stinson.305344313.html">local columnist</a> now describes it:</p><blockquote><p><em><p>
BERKELEY SOUTHWEST.
</p>
<p>
If you think the 2003-2005 City Council occasionally deteriorated into a political circus, wait till you see its successor when there is no Ed Garza, Enrique Barrera or Carroll Schubert around to limit the liberal wackiness.</p></em></p></blockquote><p>Who knew Deep Red Texas could see liberal wackiness in this day and age?</p>

<p>Perhaps someone should point out to columnist Roddy Stinson, though, that he really should be calling us BERKELEY SOUTHEAST.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Local blog <a href="http://allthingsconservative.typepad.com/all_things_conservative/2005/06/yay_global_warm.html">All Things Conservative</a> has a post about a recent article from a British newspaper, the Telegraph, that claims that global warming will bring about plenty of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/06/12/nwarm12.xml">good things</a>. </p>

<p>If only.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.organicmatter.net/node/131">Organic Matter</a> has already laid into portions of the article.&nbsp; But I can't resist commenting further.</p>

<p>&quot;Global warming is good.&quot;&nbsp; This is actually an old talking point.&nbsp; In fact, an entire organization exists to promote it: the pleasant-sounding <a href="http://www.greeningearthsociety.org/">Greening Earth Society</a>, funded by the <a href="http://www.westernfuels.org/">Western Fuels Association</a>.&nbsp; Yes, the coal industry.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Telegraph article, focusing on these alleged benefits of global warming, fails to mention any real benefits that apply outside of northern, fairly wealthy countries such as the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada, and the United States.&nbsp; And some of the benefits for those countries that it mentions are pathetically meager:</p><blockquote><p><em>Last year, a team at the University of Hamburg showed
that a modest temperature rise would lead to 30 per cent more tourists
visiting countries such as Russia and Canada.</em></p>

<p><em>The
benefits to UK tourism may also be substantial, according to a recent
study by the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia,
which concluded: &quot;We may witness not only an expansion in the domestic
market, but an expansion in the inbound international market as the UK
develops a more Mediterranean climate.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Left unsaid is the distinct possibility that climate change brought on by global warming could end up shutting down the Atlantic gulf stream that currently keeps northern Europe far warmer than most other areas at such high latitudes.&nbsp; But perhaps the UK could develop a new skiing industry to attract tourists in that case.</p>

<p>After all, as the article points out, humans are endlessly adaptable, and we really shouldn't sell them short.</p><blockquote><p><em>Climate scientists have made little of the benefits of a warming
planet, and even less of the ability of humans to cope with the
consequences. From the changes in irrigation and new crops made by
American farmers that prevented a repetition of the 1930s Dust Bowl, to
the sea-wall system that protects northern Vietnam, there is no lack of
evidence for human inventiveness in the face of climate change.</em></p></blockquote><p>Left unsaid is how much this coping will cost, and how much human suffering will take place in the meantime.&nbsp; A repetition of the Dust Bowl was avoided, but wouldn't it have been better to have prevented it in the first place?</p>

<p>The low point of the article comes with a quote from Philip Stott, emeritus professor of biogeography at the University of London.</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;If you could vote for a change in climate, you would always want a
warmer one,&quot; says Philip Stott, emeritus professor of biogeography at
the University of London. &quot;Cold is nearly always worse for everything -
the economy, agriculture, disease, biodiversity&quot;.</em></p></blockquote><p>As Organic Matter puts it, this is &quot;surprisingly idiotic.&quot;&nbsp; I would prefer not to use such harsh words (especially since Professor Stott has his own <a href="https://greenspin.blogspot.com/">blog</a>!), but the fellow at Organic Matter does have a point.&nbsp; What would Stott's vote be if given a choice between the Little Ice Age of a few centuries ago and, say, the planet Venus?</p>

<p>Back on Earth, the climate is a lot more complicated than simple choices between &quot;warm&quot; climates and &quot;cold&quot; ones.&nbsp; Stott also neglects that we are starting from a period as warm or warmer than any other period in at least the last <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=122">thousand years</a>.</p>

<p>The only interesting point the Telegraph article brings up is global warming's effect upon agriculture.&nbsp; But even here, the article overemphasizes modest potential benefits in northern, wealthy nations, while neglecting the almost certain downsides for agriculture in developing countries.&nbsp; This is an interesting subject, though, that I am now inspired to learn more about.</p>

<p>Finally, the article closes with the old canard, from Professor Stott, about how doing anything to combat emissions of greenhouse gases and reduce global warming will destroy the global economy.</p><blockquote><p><em>Even if we shut every fossil-fuel power station, crushed every car and
grounded every aircraft, the Earth's climate would still continue to
get warmer, according to Prof Stott. &quot;The trouble is, we would all be
too impoverished to cope with the consequences,&quot; he said.</em></p></blockquote><p>Someone tell Stott not to worry—no one is proposing any such actions!&nbsp; Developing the new energy technologies that necessary to reduce greenhouse gases should be a net economic boon, as almost all innovative work is.&nbsp; Someone with the supreme confidence in human invention that Stott has should be able to see that.</p>

<p>On his blog, <a href="https://greenspin.blogspot.com/2005_06_12_greenspin_archive.html#111885458982133953">Stott</a> wrote yesterday:</p><blockquote><p><em>It is nearly obscene, with all our resources, to think that we shall not be able to adapt once again - <span style="font-style: italic;">unless, that is, we have lost our evolutionary dynamism and drive</span>.</em></p></blockquote><p>With that attitude, Stott should feel comfortable with our ability to adapt to using the new energy sources necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

		<a href="../../personal_politi.html">Personal politics</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Fellow San Antonian <a href="https://rhetoricrhythm.blogspot.com/2005/06/political-odyssey-pt-1.html">Mike Thomas</a> revealed a little of his political past in a post last week that described his journey from a young Reaganite in 1984 to a&nbsp; liberal, anti-GOP, pro-Democratic Jesse Jackson voter in 1988.&nbsp; He's also promised a second installment where he will reveal more about how &quot;there were two other events that were even more crucial to my transformation - the Iran-Contra scandal and the JFK assassination.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Such stories of how people have reached their current political views have particularly fascinated me in recent years.&nbsp; So now I am tempted to write up my own story soon—at least in part.&nbsp; And I encourage any other bloggers or commenters who happen to read this to follow Mike's example and tell us a little bit about what people or events in your life helped to shape your current politics.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though, I will simply say that I have not undergone a transformation as dramatic as Mike's.&nbsp; But I was not always the partisan Democrat that I am today.&nbsp; I considered myself an independent for quite a while, and sometimes even considered voting for Republicans or third-party candidates.&nbsp; Once I actually did vote for a Republican in an important race.&nbsp; And another time I came very close, but decided not to vote.</p>

<p>Since I suspect I may never have actually told anyone about that former vote, except for anonymous people on internet discussion forums, I think it would be interesting to turn this into a quiz to any family or friends who may read this (and anyone else as well, of course):&nbsp; Who was that Republican that I voted for?</p>

<p>If anyone cares to guess, I'll update this post later this week with the answer.&nbsp; If not, then the answer shall remain hidden.</p>

UPDATE (6-16, 8:30 AM):  Wow, thanks to my family for playing along with this silly quiz.  It was great to see so many of you posting here for the first time.
<p>
The result is...
<p>
Claire wins!  Beating out Annie with the correct answer:  Bush I in 1988.  That was never a vote I was particularly proud of, but by 1991 it had become an outright embarrassment to me.  
<p>
The other guess were all very good.  Pete Wilson was the one I almost voted for.  If I had voted in the 1990 election for governor of California, I almost certainly would have voted for Pete Wilson over Diane Feinstein.  I decided not to vote, in the end, since I had just moved there and didn't feel confident in my choices.  That turned out to be a very good personal decision, as I saved myself another embarrassing vote.  In 1994, I voted to kick him out.  Not that it did any good.
<p>
As for Jim Thompson, I don't think I was quite old enough to vote for him for Illinois governor in 1986.  Missed it by a few weeks.  I know I didn't vote in that election, and I don't remember who I would have voted for if I had.  But I can see myself possibly having voted for him, so it was a reasonable guess.
<p>
Thanks, and we'll have to try something like this again sometime.

                                <p>The headlines are proclaiming: <a id="r-0_0" href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-06-14-gliese-planet_x.htm">Earth-like planet discovered orbiting nearby star</a>, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-planet14jun14,1,3960082.story?coll=la-headlines-nation">Distant Object May Be a Planet Similar to Ours</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/13/AR2005061301469.html">'Rocky' Earth-Like Planet Discovered</a>, <a id="r-8_0" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0506140293jun14,1,1982137.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed">Earth-like planet without life discovered outside solar system</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/14/science/space/14plan.html?">Found: Earth's Distant Cousin</a>.</p>

<p>But once you get into the meat of the articles, you find that this planet is not terribly &quot;Earth-like&quot; after all.&nbsp; (Blame the astronomers, not the press, for this one.&nbsp; Their <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-06/uoc--adm061305.php">press release</a> is entitled &quot;Astronomers discover most Earth-like extrasolar planet yet.&quot;)</p>

<p>This new planet is roughly seven and a half times more massive than Earth, which makes it more comparable to the small gas giants Uranus and Neptune, at roughly half of their mass.&nbsp; Also, it orbits a tiny red dwarf star, much dimmer than our own Sun.&nbsp; Finally, it is extremely close to that small star, so that it is still <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/14/science/space/14plan.html?">searing hot</a>.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><em>At such a close distance, the planet could be tidally locked,
keeping the same face toward its star at all times. Dr. Marcy said the
temperature on the side of the planet facing the star would be 400 to
700 degrees, like &quot;chicken roasting temperatures.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>That is too
warm for liquid water or ice, but it could be cold on the backside of
planet, which, as Dr. Marcy said, &quot;faces the darkness of the universe.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>We wouldn't be particularly comfortable if Earth were anything like that.</p>

<p>If the speculation that it is rocky, and not a gas giant, is correct, it would be a bit more accurate to label it a Mercury-like, or perhaps Venus-like, planet.&nbsp; But, as with many of the <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/planets/">extrasolar planets</a> discovered to this point, our solar system has no comparable objects.&nbsp; The current means of detecting planets is geared, of necessity, to finding either very massive ones, like Jupiter and Saturn, or ones extraordinarily close to their parent star.&nbsp; Our system has no planets of the latter type, so one of the big surprises of this research since the mid-1990s is the large number of such planets being found.</p>

<p>Of course, this particular discovery is still fascinating.&nbsp; Its discoverers have every right to brag, since they are pushing current technology to its limits in detecting planets so small.&nbsp; But someday, perhaps within another decade, with new <a href="http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/">space-based instruments</a>, we actually will discover Earth-like planets.&nbsp; So let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=16981">House Appropriations Committee</a> apparently understands better the value of Earth science than does the current top management of NASA (via <a href="http://www.nasawatch.com/archives/2005/06/house_approps_o.html">NASA Watch</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>
The Committee is very concerned about the reductions to NASA's science programs especially the drastic reductions to earth science programs designed to provide a better understanding of our planet. 
</em></p>

<p>
<em>...
</em></p>

<p>
<em>To begin to address this shortcoming the Committee is providing $40,000,000 [to NASA science] above the budget request. Within the funds provided for science, $35,000,000 is included for the Glory mission, an increase of $30,000,000 above the budget request. Without this additional funding, the amount designated in the fiscal year 2006 budget request would clearly have resulted in the unraveling of Glory as an integrated mission and resulted in a certain delay in the launch of key instruments several years beyond the planned launch date. NASA's Glory program is a key Global Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI) mission and critical to the achievement of CCRI's science goals.
</em></p></blockquote><p>

So Glory is saved, at least for now.

</p>

<p>I'd heard about the extra $40 million earlier, but didn't know exactly where that money would be going.&nbsp; I am very glad to see that most of it is going to Earth science and, in particular, to the Glory mission.</p>

<p>I haven't written specifically about <a href="http://glory.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Glory</a> yet, except for a brief mention in my op-ed for the <a href="http://dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/09//opinion/op-ed/9oped09bryant.txt">Washington Examiner</a>, but one of its primary goals is to study the behavior of aerosols in Earth's atmosphere.&nbsp; The properties of these tiny particles are a major uncertainty in current climate models.&nbsp; So un-cancelling Glory will be a major boon to research into the effects of global warming.

</p>

<p>That still leaves <a href="../../../05/nasas_earthobse.html">Global Precipitation Measurement</a> delayed, and at least three <a href="../../../05/nasas_gifts_mis.html">other</a> <a href="../../ocean_vector_wi.html">missions</a> cancelled.&nbsp; But any good news on this front is quite welcome.

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Young progressive blogger <a title="Ezra Klein: Repeal McCain-Feingold!" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/repeal_mccainfe.html">Ezra Klein</a> has echoed an appeal by economics professor <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/06/time_to_repeal.html#more">James Hamilton</a> to repeal the McCain-Feingold campaign reform act.&nbsp; The McCain-Feingold law, officially known as the <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/campaign/legislation/bcralaw/index.cfm">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002</a>, did two things:&nbsp; (1) eliminate the old, unregulated &quot;soft money&quot; contributions to political parties, and (2) place stricter regulations on campaign ads in the period immediately preceding elections.</p>

<p>Both Klein and Hamilton dislike the new system of independent groups (called &quot;527 organizations&quot;) that has sprung up, largely in response to the ban on soft money.&nbsp; Hamilton further dislikes what he thinks are free speech restrictions as a result of the tighter regulation of campaign ads.</p>

<p>Campaign finance reform has been a very complicated issue, and I can't claim to fully understand all the details of the current system (or even the pre-2002 system).&nbsp; But I think the fundamental principles of the McCain-Feingold law are sound, so what deficiencies arise can be fixed by tweaking the law, rather than simply throwing it out.</p>

<p>Klein writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>I'd much rather have parties absorbing unlimited contributions than
watch the funding get sucked up by unaccountable, unknowable 527's. 
Parties and campaigns can, at the least, be held accountable.&nbsp; 527's,
on the other hand, are just hatchet men, called in for the dirty work
and disavowed for the cameras.</em></p></blockquote><p>But independent &quot;hatchet men&quot; existed long before McCain-Feingold became law.&nbsp; Repealing the act would do nothing to eliminate them.&nbsp; Requiring disclosure of their funding sources, however, would help solve the &quot;unaccountable, unknowable&quot; problem.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I do oppose efforts to impose soft money restrictions on independent groups like 527 organizations, as <a href="http://www.reason.com/rauch/050905.shtml">some Senators</a> have proposed.&nbsp; Restricting donatons to independent groups of citizens violates the fundamental principles of our government.</p>

<p>How to treat the regulations on campaign ads that Hamilton dislikes is a much more complicated issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've never been entirely comfortable with that aspect of McCain-Feingold.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I think Hamilton's criticism is overblown.</p><blockquote><p><em> So what exactly now defines prohibited participation in an election?&nbsp; When Congressman David 
Dreier (R-CA) ran into a withering hail of criticism last October for his position on 
immigration from co-hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou at Los Angeles <a href="http://www.kfi640.com/main.html"> radio station KFI</a>, the National Republican 
Congressional Committee <a href="http://www.kfi640.com/timages/page/media/JNKFEC.pdf"> filed a 
complaint</a>
with the Federal Election Commission, arguing that, since the radio
station on which the views were expressed was owned by a corporation,
these broadcasts represented an illegal corporate contribution to the
campaign of Dreier's opponent, Democrat Cynthia Matthews. The NRCC
complaint further argued that, under McCain-Feingold, the radio hosts
could personally be criminally prosecuted for felonies for assisting in
Matthews' campaign in this way, specifically mentioning a 5-year jail
term. To be sure, the radio hosts had been vitriolic in their attacks
on Dreier, and described their agenda openly as a &quot;fire Dreier&quot;
campaign. But is it really a felony in America today to say loudly and
repeatedly that a certain elected official needs to be dumped?&nbsp; </em></p></blockquote><p>To answer his question:&nbsp; apparently not, since I presume the radio hosts and owner are not being prosecuted for this.&nbsp; The NRCC, in typical Republican fashion, is always going to try to intimidate its critics prior to an election.&nbsp; If McCain-Feingold were repealed, they would simply find another law to use, and there are plenty of earlier campaign regulations they can point to.</p>

<p>So while McCain-Feingold obviously is not perfect and leaves a lot to be desired, a strong case for repealing it has yet to be made.</p>

<p>The ultimate, simple, solution to campaign financing, which Ezra Klein alludes to in his post, remains requiring television and radio stations that broadcast over the public airwaves to donate air time to candidates in the weeks preceding elections.&nbsp; One of the most expensive line items in campaigns is thus eliminated.&nbsp; And candidates of unequal funding enter the playing field at a much more equal level.&nbsp; Of course, given the huge windfall that broadcast stations make from political ads, they are not going to like this idea at all.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The late-April <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309096723/html">National Research Council report</a> on the state of NASA's Earth science program mentioned six important missions that were in dire budget straits due to NASA's <a href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/08/opinion/op-ed/9oped09bryant.txt">misplaced emphasis</a> on sending humans back to the dead Moon rather than learn more about our own changing planet. Earlier I've covered <a href="../../../05/nasas_earthobse.html">Global Precipitation Measurement</a>, which aims to measure rainfall over the bulk of the planet, and the <a href="../../../05/nasas_gifts_mis.html">GIFTS mission</a>, which would demonstrate new technology for more detailed and more accurate measurements of atmospheric temperature and water vapor.&nbsp; Despite their great potential for directly benefitting our lives through improved weather forecasting, climate prediction, and more, the former has been delayed until 2010, while the latter has been cancelled.</p>

<p>Another cancelled mission is called &quot;Ocean Vector Winds.&quot;&nbsp; Its goal is simple:&nbsp; to measure the speed and direction of winds over the ocean surface.&nbsp; What does this data buy us?&nbsp; Apparently, quite a lot:&nbsp; improved weather forecasts and storm warnings; improved knowledge of air-sea interactions and ocean circulation and thus improved climate models; and the possibility of more accurate El Nino forecasts.&nbsp; El Nino, as many know, is the phenomenon, driven by changes in air and ocean circulation in the equatorial Pacific, that leads to drastic disruptions of normal climate patterns every few years, with corresponding drastic disruptions to the lives of many millions of people.<br /> </p>

<p>As the NRC panel indicates, the combination of all these benefits would also allow for better management of global agriculture, water resources, and more.&nbsp; This is one of many areas of Earth science where improving our overall knowledge will have wide-ranging benefits to great numbers of people all over the world.</p>

<p>Ocean surface winds can be measured from the ground, can't they?&nbsp; Does this really require a satellite?&nbsp; Indeed, <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">buoys</a> and ships can be, and have been, used to provide similar measurements.&nbsp; But they cannot cover nearly enough territory to provide a global map of ocean winds.&nbsp; The data they provide is helpful, but not nearly comprehensive enough to offer the same knowledge and benefits as data from a satellite that can scan all the world's oceans in a short amount of time.<br />
<a href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/index.cfm"><img width="200" height="128" border="0" src="../../../../images/seawindsquikscatlogo.gif" title="Seawindsquikscatlogo" alt="Seawindsquikscatlogo" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a><br />
Aren't there satellites that are already gathering this data for us?&nbsp; Yes, there is currently one such satellite, a NASA satellite called <a href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/index.cfm">QuikSCAT</a> that carries a scatterometer instrument called SeaWinds.&nbsp; QuickSCAT was launched in 1999 as a quick replacement for <a href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/nscat/index.cfm">NSCAT</a>, which had prematurely failed a couple years earlier after a short, but successful, mission.</p>

<p>QuikSCAT has continued NSCAT's successes, while avoiding its premature death. A forecaster from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's Tropical Prediction Center is quoted in the NRC report saying that &quot;without QuikSCAT they would be forecasting in the dark.&quot;&nbsp; QuikSCAT not only hasn't failed, but is now three years beyond its designed lifetime.&nbsp; Since it won't last forever, what comes next?</p>

<p>Its first followup, <a href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/seawinds/index.cfm">SeaWinds on ADEOS-II</a>, followed the unfortunate path of NSCAT and failed in 2003 after only a few months of operation.&nbsp; And now the other followup, Ocean Vector Winds, originally scheduled for launch in 2008, has been cancelled by NASA.</p>

<p>(Orbiting American scatterometers appear to frequently fall victim to <a href="http://nsidc.org/data/docs/daac/scatterometer_instrument.gd.html">power failures</a> on the satellites that carried them.&nbsp; The original NASA scatterometer was launched on NASA's Seasat mission in 1978.&nbsp; Less than 100 days after launch, &quot;a power failure terminated the mission.&quot; NASA didn't send another scatterometer into space until NSCAT in 1996.&nbsp; Barely nine months into its mission aboard the Japanese spacecraft ADEOS-I, &quot;a power failure terminated the mission.&quot;&nbsp; Then in 2003, a SeaWinds scatterometer was launched on ADEOS-II.&nbsp; You guessed it:&nbsp; six months later, &quot;a power failure terminated the mission.&quot;&nbsp; Only QuickSCAT, the one mission thrown together in a hurry, has escaped this curse of the power failure.)</p>

<p>So what is a scatterometer anyway?&nbsp; A scatterometer bounces microwaves off the ocean surface at an angle and measures how much of this radiation gets scattered back to its detectors.&nbsp; The size of this &quot;backscatter&quot; signal is a measure of the roughness of the ocean surface on the scale of the wavelength of the radiation—in the case of these instruments, a few centimeters.</p>

<p>How does this give us the wind speed and direction at the ocean surface?&nbsp; As the air moves across the ocean, it generates waves, typically with wavelengths on the order of centimeters—generating exactly the roughness on the ocean surface that will cause the radar backscatter that is measured by the scatterometer.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://manati.orbit.nesdis.noaa.gov/quikscat/"><img width="200" height="150" border="0" src="../../../../images/quikscat0613.png" title="Quikscat0613" alt="QuikSCAT data" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>Via the method described above, QuikSCAT can measure wind speeds from 7 to 45 miles per hour, with an accuracy of around 4 miles per hour.&nbsp; By bouncing microwaves off the ocean at different angles as the satellite orbits overhead, the direction the waves are facing, and hence the wind direction, can also be derived, to an accuracy of around 20 degrees.&nbsp; According to a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/303/5660/978?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=Chelton&amp;searchid=1118636652548_6225&amp;stored_search=&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0">2004 article</a> in Science magazine, this accuracy in speed and direction is comparable to the accuracy of buoy measurements.&nbsp; Unlike buoys, though, the QuikSCAT data is averaged over regions 16 miles across.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://cioss.coas.oregonstate.edu/CIOSS/workshops/miami_meeting/Agenda.html">complications</a>, of course.&nbsp; Rain, in particular, can contaminate the backscatter measurements, by scattering plenty of microwave radiation itself and also by roughening the ocean surface independent of any wind.&nbsp; Land also spoils the data, so ocean winds within 16 miles of land cannot be reliably measured by QuikSCAT.</p>

<p>Looking forward to when QuikSCAT finally dies of old age, the European Space Agency plans to launch its own scatterometer, <a href="http://www.esa.int/esaME/ascat.html">ASCAT</a>, on its first polar-orbiting environmental satellite later this year.&nbsp; ASCAT will only have about half the coverage of QuickSCAT, however, and the NRC notes that the large gap between its measurement swaths will make it difficult to use to improve weather forecasts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, NASA, NOAA, and the Department of Defense teamed up to launch <a href="http://www.ipo.noaa.gov/Projects/windsat.html">Windsat</a> in 2003.&nbsp; Windsat aims to measure ocean winds, but with a radiometer rather than a scatterometer.&nbsp; In other words, by measuring microwave emissions coming up through the atmosphere rather than by bouncing microwaves off the ocean surface.&nbsp; This is a new method, and a test case for a <a href="http://www.npoess.noaa.gov/Technology/cmis_summary.html">future instrument</a> to be incorporated into the <a href="http://www.ipo.noaa.gov/">next generation of polar-orbiting weather satellites</a>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, according to the NRC report, &quot;Preliminary analysis suggests that such passive systems will produce wind observations with less accuracy and with more contamination by rain and land than active scatterometers.&quot;</p>

<p>So, with the cancellation of the Ocean Vector Winds mission, is QuikSCAT the end of the road for American scatterometers?&nbsp; Will we have to be content with a reduced capability for measuring ocean surface winds?&nbsp; It sounds so esoteric when I put it that way.&nbsp; Instead, perhaps I should borrow words from the NRC report and ask if will we will be content to allow a situation that &quot;would worsen El Nino and hurricane forecasts and weather forecasts in coastal areas?&quot;</p>

<p>We have a great tool available for learning more about the planet we live on.&nbsp; A tool that we've already spent many years perfecting.&nbsp; A tool with no comparable replacement.&nbsp; Why abandon it now?</p>

<p>Today, the Denver Post has an op-ed about the state of NASA's Earth science programs by <a href="http://denverpost.com/opinion/ci_2793425">James C. Wilson</a>, a professor of engineering at the University of Denver, who leads a group that builds instruments for atmospheric research.&nbsp; As I have also tried to do over the last month, Wilson points out the importance of these programs that NASA is cutting.&nbsp; But one sentence he adds gives the impression that the situation is even more critical than I imagined:</p><blockquote><p><em><span id="default">Fiscal year 2005 Earth science research funds are
now six months late, and many university research groups supported by
NASA science funds are collapsing.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Current year funds are six months late?&nbsp; This is the first I've seen this mentioned, though of course, it is quite possible that I've overlooked something.&nbsp; Is this a general problem, or restricted to certain groups, with Wilson's presumably being one of them?<br /><em></em></p>

                                <p>A few weeks ago, I discovered Jeff Foust's informative "<a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/">Space Politics</a>" blog, and have been reading it ever since, in trying to keep abreast of all the changes going on at NASA these days.  So I was pleasantly surprised to see that he commented on my <a href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/08/opinion/op-ed/9oped09bryant.txt">op-ed</a> in the Washington Examiner today, as well as the other piece mine was paired with, by <a href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/08/opinion/op-ed/8oped09schulze.txt">Charles Schultze</a>, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institute.  Foust had some mild <a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/archives/000560.html">criticism</a> for both of us.<blockquote><em>While both make some good points, particularly about concerns that science programs at NASA are getting squeezed in the short term (something House appropriators agree with to some degree, having added $40 million for them in the FY06 budget), I am personally disappointed with the logic of both essays. Both try to establish a dichotomy: in one [Schultze's], you can either save money to restore Medicare and Social Security, or you can fling people across the solar system; in the other [mine], you can either study the Earth to save us from natural disasters, or you can fling people across the solar system. Both, I think, are false dichotomies: Medicare and Social Security require fundamental structural changes that cannot be solved even if you disbanded NASA (good robotic science missions and all) and dispersed its budget to those programs. Climate change and other earth sciences studies are serious issues that require roles for multiple government actors, not just NASA. Rather than constructing simplistic either-or decision sets, let's see if there's a way to do both—and take advantage of what benefits of exploration we can reap in the process.</em></blockquote>I agree that, in principle, choosing between studying Earth and flying people to the Moon and Mars is a false dichotomy.  But in the real world of NASA today, it is a very real dichotomy.  NASA has one pot of money.  Bush and Congress have not given NASA any significant amount of extra funding, while saddling the space agency with the huge new mandate of sending astronauts back to the Moon in the next ten years.</p>

<p>The result is clear.  NASA is siphoning money off of its tremendously productive science programs&#151aeronautics research, space science, and Earth science are all getting big hits.  And by my article, I hope to issue a reminder that, despite their low public profile, NASA's Earth science missions are extremely important to all of us who live on this planet.  They should not be sacrificed for a goal with many fewer benefits to society.  </p>

<p>If the public clamor is loud enough, perhaps Congress will provide NASA with extra funds&#151in order to satisfy my so-called "Vision for Understanding Earth" while also still satisfying Bush's "Vision for Space Exploration."  Alternatively, if necessary (and it probably is, given Bush's huge budget deficits), Congress could override the President's priorities and fully fund NASA's Earth science programs at the expense of the manned space program.  Or at least fund it well enough to keep it alive for the long-term.</p>

<p>If so, returning to the Moon may have to wait a while longer.  Given the urgency of dealing with the changing life support systems of our planet, I think the wait will be very worthwhile.</p>
