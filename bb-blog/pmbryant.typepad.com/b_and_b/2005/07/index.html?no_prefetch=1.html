                                <p>The second edition of the blog carnival for birders, <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm">I and the Bird</a>, is out&#151published at <a href="http://www.charliesbirdblog.com/">Charlie's Bird Blog</a> this week.</p>

<p>Take a trip over there to learn, among other things, about those hard-to-figure-out <a href="https://thomasburg-walks.blogspot.com/2005/06/little-brown-birds-part-2.html">little brown birds</a> called sparrows from Pamela Martin in Thomasburg, Ontario.  And also about the slow-but-sure recovery of the <a href="http://www.beakspeak.com/archive/2005/06/27/flight_o.shtml">California condor</a> from Jason at Beakspeak.</p>

<p>My own experience with sparrows is probably typical of <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/july2005.htm#7/6/05">(bad)</a> birdwatchers.  I'm good at picking out Chipping Sparrows, since they swarm our backyard feeders in the winter, but everything else is a blur.  Except for Lark Sparrows, of course, but they are special, and I don't get to see them very frequently.  (And never in my backyard, alas.)</p>

<p>As for condors, I've never seen one.  Back when I lived in southern California, the recovery program was just starting to re-release them into the wild.  And I was totally ignorant of birds at the time.  But I have been following their recovery ever since that time, and hope to get a chance to see one the next time I'm out West.  That may be a while, unfortunately.</p>

<p>What is definite, though, is that this blog has the honor of hosting the third edition of <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm">I and the Bird</a> in two weeks.  So, as Charlie says, send your submissions to either <a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b2622202e0b7a7b7b7b7b2922392f3865282426">Mike</a> of 10,000 Birds or <a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84f4e1f0e1f6e9e6f6fde5eaf0c4f7e6e7e3e8ebe6e5e8aaeae1f0">me</a> by Tuesday, August 2nd.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Labor lawyer <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/003234.shtml#more">Nathan Newman</a>, whose views on Supreme Court issues I have come to place deep trust in over the last couple years,  has posted his thoughts about John Roberts, Bush's Supreme Court nominee.  He comes away with an optimistic attitude (emphasis his).<br />
<em><blockquote>I've actually had a chance to read through Roberts' hearings when he was up for the Court of Appeals and I have to admit I feel (relatively) more hopeful. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>[T]he most likely possibility is that he won't be surprising and here's my bet on how he will perform from the evidence.   <strong>In general, he will be less of a judicial activist than O'Connor in both bad ways but also potentially good ways.</strong></p>

<p>Where there is no constitutional issue, he will unquestionably interpret statutes in a conservative manner, and where there is ambiguity in a statute, I am sure that Roberts will likely always take the interpretation that favors corporate and rightwing interests.  But O'Connor was no different as a dependable vote for business interests.  </p>

<p>But reading his decisions and his statements in the hearings, <strong>Roberts really does seem to believe in deferring to elected government, which is probably not surprising for someone who spent so much of his career representing governments</strong> arguing on behalf of courts not overriding their power.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>So to the extent that Roberts sticks to these principles, he will be a conservative Justice but not one that will use his thirty years on the bench to block a lot of progressive legislation from the bench.</strong></p>

<p>Again, he may be a raving activist lunatic beneath the hood, but on the evidence he may be exactly what Bush says he is, a judge who won't legislative from the bench.  If that's the compromise that Dems have extracted through the threat of a filibuster, I'll take that as a small victory.</blockquote></em></p>

<p>If Newman's optimistic analysis ends up being correct, then that is far more than a small victory.  That is a giant leap.  (Though it's sad that keeping the court about the same ideologically, when it is already quite conservative, is such a great victory.)</p>

<p>Newman points out that he still thinks Democrats should filibuster Roberts, presumably due to reasons he gave in a post <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/003231.shtml">yesterday</a> (emphasis his again):<br />
<em><blockquote><strong>So if his career is one of years of political hack partisanship, sprinkled with a few years acting as a well-paid hack on behalf of corporate interests, why should we believe Roberts has the temperment to be an independent Justice?</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>If the words Roberts wrote for all his clients don't reflect work upon which he should be evaluated, then the two years on the bench is too little experience to be confirmed.  </p>

<p><strong>And if all John Roberts can say is, sorry, I've been a partisan hack for twenty-five years, so I don't have any vision that I can talk about -- well, that's not good enough either and he should be rejected.</strong> </blockquote></em></p>

<p>Hopefully the confirmation hearings will shed more light on which of these interpretations of Roberts, if either, is the correct one.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Bush's selection of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/20/politics/20cnd-judge.html?ex=1279512000&en=f93c7ad5e913caf8&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">John Roberts</a> for the Supreme Court should not be a surprise.  In the use of his power, Bush really only cares about two things: his cronies and his favorite corporations.  John Roberts represents both of those, in <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/John_G._Roberts_Jr.">abundance</a>, having been a loyal Republican apparatchik and corporate lawyer for his whole career.  </p>

<p>Ok, Bush also cares about a third thing, if only out of necessity:  not pissing off the fundamentalist crowd too much.  That ruled out Alberto Gonzales for now.  I suspect he'll get another chance though.  </p>

<p>As could be expected, Bush's nominee's history gives every indication that he will be a protector of Big Money and Big (secret) Government at the expense of the average citizen of this country.  I hope to hear differently during the confirmation hearings.  But I don't expect to.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Cernig at <a href="https://cernigsnewshog.blogspot.com/2005/07/can-we-end-hype-now.html">NewsHog</a> thinks that Bush shouldn't fire anyone unless they are convicted of a crime.  Convicted.  Not accused.  Not even indicted.  Convicted.<br />
<em><blockquote>But it has to be said, if the roles were reversed the Democrats would insist on a conviction before firing a high-placed aide too. Not an allegation, however well it was backed by evidence, not a criminal charge even - a conviction.</blockquote></em></p>

<p>Recent history, however, demonstrates this charge is utterly wrong.  In fact, history shows that administrations of both parties, up until the current one, got rid of problematic aides routinely.  Typically, all it took was solid evidence of unethical behavior.  Not even indictments.</p>

<p>In the mid-stages of Watergate, Nixon axed <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/050173-1.htm">numerous</a> White House aides and other political appointees who had not been indicted, including both of his chief advisors, Haldeman and Ehrlichman.  Early in the last Democratic administration, Clinton's close advisor <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/white_house/april97/hubbell_4-2.html">Web Hubbell</a> resigned from a top Justice Department job while facing a criminal investigation, prior to any indictment or conviction.</p>

<p>It hasn't even taken a major criminal scandal to force the resignation of White House aides.  G.H.W. Bush's chief of staff, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0207.green.html">John Sununu</a>, was "forced out after he was found to have used a government vehicle to attend a rare-stamp convention."</p>

<p>Furthermore, as far as <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0207.green.html">Democrats</a> go:<em><blockquote>In 1993, for example, Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, was forced to resign after failing to fully disclose the number of contacts between the White House and Treasury over Whitewater. Shortly thereafter, David Watkins, a White House administrator, resigned a day after it came to light that he had taken a government helicopter to play golf. </blockquote></em></p>

<p>And going back a bit <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0828745.html">further</a>:<blockquote><em>[Bert Lance] was one of Jimmy Carter's closest advisers during the 1976 presidential campaign. After the election, Carter appointed him Director of the Office of Management and Budget. However, allegations of financial irregularities in his management of the Calhoun (Ga.) National Bank and another Georgia bank forced his resignation later in 1977.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>The idea that only a conviction should be enough to force someone out of public office is completely off-base.  It is only the current administration that feels itself so above reproach that the only way anyone will ever be held accountable is if they are convicted in a court of law.  The idea that Democrats would act the same way, or even that different Republicans would act the same way, is demonstrably false.</p>

<p>Cernig also thinks the Rove/Wilson/Plame affair is overhyped.  I disagree.  As others, including New York Times columnist <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0717-20.htm">Frank Rich</a>, have pointed out, that the big picture of this issue is not about Rove, Wilson, or Plame.  It is about an administration that used deception to lure this country into an "ill-conceived" war and then has relentlessly tried to cover up its deceit by attacking those who attempt to uncover it, possibly even to the exent of breaking the law and endangering national security in the process.  That is not hype.  That is a big deal.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It's after 2 AM here in Texas, and I see two new articles on the Rove/Plame affair in the new day's papers.  The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/15/politics/15rove.html?ex=1279080000&en=8389b1a301900a63&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times</a> report is based on an anonymous source friendly to Karl Rove.  It says:<blockquote><em>Mr. Rove has told investigators that he learned from the columnist the name of the C.I.A. officer, who was referred to by her maiden name, Valerie Plame, and the circumstances in which her husband, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, traveled to Africa to investigate possible uranium sales to Iraq, the person said. </p>

<p>After hearing Mr. Novak's account, the person who has been briefed on the matter said, Mr. Rove told the columnist: "I heard that, too."<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/15/AR2005071500036.html">Washington Post</a> has a similar story, but based on a lawyer "who has firsthand knowledge of the conversations between Rove and prosecutors."  It says:<blockquote><em>At the end of that 15- or 20-minute call, according to the lawyer, Novak said he had learned that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA.</p>

<p>"I heard that, too," Rove replied, according to the lawyer, confirming the [New York] Times account. The Times article reports that Rove learned about Plame from Novak, but the lawyer with firsthand knowledge of the case said Rove was not certain of that.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>This conversation, according to the Times, took place on July 8, 2003.  Three days before Rove revealed Plame's CIA job to Matt Cooper of Time magazine, and six days before Novak's Chicago Sun-Times column officially outing Plame was published.</p>

<p>Daily Kos has a handy <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/Plame_Leak_timeline">timeline</a> of the whole Wilson/Plame/Rove affair.  July 8 was two days after Joe Wilson's original New York Times op-ed attacking the Bush administration appeared, and one day after the White House was forced to retract its earlier allegation that Iraq had sought uranium from Niger.</p>

<p>According to the timeline, on July 8 the following happened:<blockquote><em>A friend informs Wilson that Robert Novak believes that his wife had something to do with Wilson's appointment to investigate the Yellow Cake claim in Africa.</em><blockquote>He asked Novak if he could walk a block or two with him, as they were headed in the same direction; Novak acquiesced. Striking up a conversation, my friend, without revealing that he knew me, asked Novak about the Uranium controversy. It was a minor problem, Novak replied, and opined that the administration should have dealt with it weeks before. My friend then asked Novak what he thought about me, and Novak answered: "Wilson's an asshole. The CIA sent him. His wife, Valerie [Plame], works for the CIA. She's a weapons of mass destruction specialist. She sent him."</blockquote><em>Wilson's friend went right to Wilson's office and documented the exchange.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>So someone told Novak about Plame's true occupation on or before July 8.  As we learned today, Rove's conversation with Novak was on July 8.</p>

<p>If we believe the Rove-friendly account in today's papers, someone had already spread around Plame's CIA job to both Novak and Rove.  Who?  Rove, by the account in the Washington Post, has conveniently forgotten.  </p>

<p>If we don't believe the Rove-friendly account, then this timing is extremely suspicious.</p>

<p>UPDATE (10:22 AM):  I cross-posted this last night at <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/7/15/31151/4679">TPMCafe</a>.  In that version substitute 2003 for my late-night "1993".</p>

                                <p>In trying to explain why the Supreme Court decision in the recent <em><a href="../06/judicial_activi.html">Kelo</a></em> eminent domain case was wrong, Express-News columnist <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/columnists/jgurwitz/stories/MYSA071305.7B.gurwitz.6147fcdd.html">Jonathan Gurwitz</a> illustrates why it was right.</p>

<p>He starts off lauding Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's vociferous dissent:<blockquote><em>Judicial opinions are often dry and pedantic exercises in jurisprudence. O'Connor's dissent in Kelo, however, is a clear warning for all American citizens and a wake-up call for lawmakers in state capitols and in Washington.</p>

<p>"Under the banner of economic development," O'Connor writes, "all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgraded — i.e., given to an owner who will use it in a way that the legislature deems more beneficial to the public."<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>In contrast to Gurwitz, I see this much-publicized statement of O'Connor's as overly alarmist and misleading, as if the <em>Kelo</em> decision represented a great departure from previous use of eminent domain.  For many decades, governments have had the power to seize private property from  individuals, with "just compensation," and then do as they wish with it, including handing it over to other individuals.  All that was needed was the say the magic word "blight," as <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_06/006581.php">Kevin Drum</a> pointed out a few weeks ago:<blockquote><em>[T]he definition of "blighted" has been pretty elastic for a long time. In Los Angeles, the poor-but-not-especially-blighted Chavez Ravine was condemned in the early 50s for a public housing project, but eventually the land was turned over to Walter O'Malley in order to build the privately owned Dodger Stadium. Similarly, in the early 90s, the Texas legislature created a special agency for the sole purpose of condemning land in Arlington so that the city could build a sparkling new stadium for George Bush's Texas Rangers. The Rangers were given control over the stadium and its surroundings plus an option to buy it later at a sweetheart price.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>So the <em>Kelo</em> decision didn't change anything fundamental.  On the contrary, if the Supreme Court had ruled as O'Connor would have liked, they would indeed have changed something very fundamental.  They would have usurped the power to decide what is an appropriate public use away from the representatives of the people.</p>

<p>Despite his praise for O'Connor's alarmist views on this decision, Gurwitz apparently recognizes that it made some sense.  Further down, he says:<br />
<blockquote><em>Writing for the majority, [Justice] Stevens allows, "Nothing in our opinion precludes any State from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings power." While [Justice] O'Connor correctly sees this as an abdication of the Supreme Court's responsibilities, it does offer a legislative way out of this public takings wilderness.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Despite his instinctual unease, Gurwitz does appear to get the basic point of the majority decision:  "a legislative way out."</p>

<p>Exactly!</p>

<p>Amazingly, Gurwitz concludes by actually shooting down O'Connor's alarmist opinion.  Although I am not sure he realizes he is doing so.<blockquote><em>As O'Connor succinctly notes, "Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory." </p>

<p>Nothing, that is, other than the ability of elected officials to correct the opinion of five Supreme Court justices.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>I would have put it as "Nothing, that is, other than the ability of elected officials to fulfill their responsibility to the public, as our system of government is designed."  But I'll take what I can get.  He's on the right track.</p>

                                <p>The San Antonio Express-News published  an <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/stories/MYSA071305.6B.rove1ed.613fc377.html">editorial</a> about the Karl Rove/Joe Wilson/Valerie Plame affair yesterday that does what Bush doesn't want the media to do.  It "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302343.html">prejudges</a>" the investigation by Justice Department special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald.  How does the editorial board know that "Rove is unlikely to be criminally culpable because there is no evidence that he intentionally leaked her name"?</p>

<p>Beyond that, the editorial board seems peculiarly anxious about the political consequences for the administration and oblivious to the larger criminal, ethical, and national security concerns.  "The political problem ... is substantial," they write.  "The way the president handles this will have a huge impact on his credibility for the remainder of his second term."</p>

<p>All true, of course.  But what about the criminal concerns?  Fitzgerald, who has a reputation as a straight-shooting prosecutor, has been investigating this case for a long time now.  We don't know where he's going with this, but there's clearly something there.  </p>

<p>What about the ethical concerns?  High-level administration officials sabotaging the career of a critic's wife by blowing her cover to at least half a dozen members of the press, either through malice or through willful ignorance.  Is everything permissible when it comes to attacking someone perceived to be a political troublemaker?</p>

<p>What about the national security concerns?  The CIA operations whose cover was blown were on issues of weapons of mass destruction.  This act could have repercussions that endanger the lives of not just CIA operatives that worked with Plame, but of people all over the world.</p>

<p>The Express-News editorial board concludes by writing:<blockquote><em>The best interest of the administration must supercede the best interest of Rove if the two diverge.<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>What about the best interest of the country?</p>

<p>UPDATE (7-21-2005):  I sent a variant of this post as a letter to the editor of the San Antonio Express-News.  Today, they <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/letters/stories/MYSA072105.1O.EDletters.2166675.html">published</a> it.<br />

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/12/science/space/12shut.html?ex=1278820800&en=c5fc57c91260ba23&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss"><img class="image-full" alt="Discovery" title="Discovery" src="../../../photos/uncategorized/discovery.jpg" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The Space Shuttle couldn't get off the ground <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/13/science/space/13cnd-shuttle.html?ex=1278907200&en=a285279990c4569b&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">today</a>, two-and-a-half years after its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">last</a>, tragic, mission.  To me, the shuttle seems a relic of a past age.  It's been nearly a quarter of a century since its maiden voyage, commanded by <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/history/apollo/apollo16/">Apollo 16</a> moonwalker <a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/young.html">John Young</a>&#151who will turn 75 later this year.  A quarter of a century prior to the first shuttle flight was 1956.  <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/sputnik/">Sputnik</a> had not been launched yet.  NASA did not exist.  </p>

<p>In manned spaceflight, we certainly haven't accomplished nearly as much over the last 25 years as over the 25 years previous.  Given the Shuttle program's age and high fatality rate, are the benefits of continuing worth the risks?  Of course, say <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/science_technology/article298917.ece">some</a>; exploration is a human imperative.  Not in this case, say others, including Bill of <a href="http://allthingsconservative.typepad.com/all_things_conservative/2005/07/shuttle_should_.html">All Things Conservative</a>:<blockquote><em>The shuttle should be mothballed.  It costs too much in both money and lives.  In 2002, the cost per mission was well over $600 million.  In 113 flights 14 astronauts have died.  Moreover, at this point in time the only mission it has is to provide service to the International Space Station; again, it isn't worth it.  We should end the shuttle program now.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Indeed, the ISS, in its downsized, half-completed, barely-functional state, is not worth it.  But how can this pioneering country give up its only manned space vehicle when it may be the better part of a decade before its successor is ready to go?  </p>

<p>Well, we've done it before.  Between 1975, when the last Apollo mission docked with a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft in orbit, and 1981, when Young and Crippen took the <em>Columbia</em> into orbit for the first time, the U.S. did not possess a functioning manned rocket.  We survived.  </p>

<p>As Bill pointed out, shuttle launches are hugely expensive.  Terminating the program sooner rather than later will save a lot of money.  Money that can then be devoted to accelerating the pace of development of its successor, currently known as the CEV.  Money that can also be devoted to ensuring that NASA does not <a href="../05/bushs_nasa.html">decimate</a> its Earth and space science programs over the coming years as the inevitable cost overruns in both the Shuttle and CEV programs occur.</p>

<p>So there's a compelling case for axeing the shuttle sooner rather than later.  Already, this administration plans to terminate the shuttle program in 2010, period, no matter whether ISS is complete or not, and it probably won't be.</p>

<p>And they are thinking of ways to ensure that someone doesn't come along and overrule this decision <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1048">later</a> (via <a href="http://www.nasawatch.com/archives/2005/07/nasa_and_white.html">NASA Watch</a>):<blockquote><em>NASA is considering retiring a Space Shuttle orbiter in 2007 and beginning modifications to one Shuttle launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center under a plan now being reviewed at NASA headquarters, according to senior agency sources. </p>

<p>Driving the idea of a phased retirement of the space vehicles are two concerns. The first is a desire for finding new sources of funds to pay for advancement of the President's moon-to-Mars plan. And secondly NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin's fears of a third Shuttle accident. </p>

<p>A source familiar with Griffin's thinking said he is worried that an age-related malfunction would trigger a Shuttle catastrophe. As a result, the space chief is seeking to retire the individual Space Shuttle orbiters as quickly as possible. </p>

<p>No final decision has been made - but discussions continued as Discovery was being prepared for launch. </p>

<p>The idea of phased Shuttle retirement is being promoted both by planners involved in the ongoing Exploration Systems Architecture Study and the Bush White House. Concern is mounting that delays in the operational status of an Earth-orbit version of the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and Congressional pressure to keep the Shuttles flying until the CEV is available might result in extension of the Shuttle retirement date beyond the fall of 2010. </p>

<p>Anti-Shuttle staffers in the Bush administration want to make certain that the shuttle fleet stops flying in 2010. A phased retirement of the Shuttle vehicles helps make that possibility more likely, according to a NASA source. According to knowledgeable sources, elements in the Bush White House had first sought in 2004 to curtail remaining Shuttle flights to as few as 15 and to reduce the content of the final configuration of the International Space Station.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>It looks like we won't have the Space Shuttle to kick around for much longer.</p>

<p>As for the CEV, I'm afraid it will turn into the "next-generation" Shuttle in more ways than one.  But that's a subject for another post.</p>

		<a href="trmm.html">Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission will live on</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Some good news on the NASA Earth science front:  it looks like NASA is <a href="http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_050620.html">extending</a> the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission.  </p>

<p><a href="http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html"><img alt="Trmm" title="Trmm" src="../../images/trmm.gif" width="250" height="47" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>I first learned about TRMM back in early May when I was researching a post on the future <a href="../05/nasas_earthobse.html">Global Precipitation Measurement</a> (GPM) mission.  GPM will be the new-and-improved version of TRMM, measuring rainfall all over the world at approximately 3-hour intervals.  TRMM, more modestly, measures rainfall throughout the tropics, and only once a day or so.</p>

<p>The data so provided by <a href="http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/">TRMM</a>, though, has turned out to be amazingly useful for both research on tropical weather and climate, and also, in an area particularly relevant to the U.S. at this time of year, the tracking of hurricanes.  </p>

<p>Alas, the TRMM satellite was due to run so low on fuel by this summer, that NASA would have to terminate the mission and save up all the remaining fuel to do a controlled reentry.  After all, ever since <a href="http://www.space.com/news/spacehistory/dangerous_reentries_000602.html">Skylab</a> in 1979, NASA has had an aversion to headlines about large satellites plunging through the atmosphere, potentially raining havoc on unsuspecting innocents underneath.</p>

<p><a href="http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/publications_dir/dennis_10jul05.html"><img alt="Trmmdennis" title="Trmmdennis" src="../../images/trmmdennis.gif" width="250" height="259" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>No problem, though.  TRMM, a joint American and Japanese project launched back in 1997, is a couple years past its expected lifetime, has been tremendously successful, and has an even-better successor lined up to take its place.  Time to bid it adieu.  It had a good life, but it's time has come.</p>

<p>Alas, due to budget decisions at NASA, the successor has been pushed back to a 2010 launch at the earliest.  Without TRMM, that would leave at least a 5-year gap in the climatological data record, and at least 5-years worth of dangerous tropical weather occurring without forecasters having the advantage of all this great precipitation data.</p>

<p>Did it make sense to purposefully dump a very useful satellite in virtually perfect working order into the ocean because of a very small risk of injuries during an uncontrolled reentry?</p>

<p>The answer is&#151it's hard to say.  At least according to a <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11195.html">report</a> from a scientific panel commissioned by NASA to look into that question late last year:<blockquote><i>Many organizations and individuals have invested in bringing TRMM data into the operational environment [weather and hurricane forecasting] because of the unique aspects of TRMM's orbit and sensor suite.  This reflects their professional judgment of the value of doing so based on their experiences of improvements in such things as accuracy of center fixes for tropical cyclones and prediction of storm intensity.  Nonetheless, the effect of TRMM data on operational applications has not been widely quantified because the data record is too short for meaningful statistical analysis and no one has done control experiments wherein the TRMM data are eliminated and the analysis is rerun.  Further, the socioeconomic effects on end-users of improved forecasts have not been quantified.</i></blockquote></p>

<p>An earlier <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/NI000578/html/19.html">review</a> by the NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance in 2002 also couldn't come up with an answer:  Is it riskier to dump TRMM or to keep it alive as long as possible?<blockquote><i>In the case of a TRMM uncontrolled reentry, the casualty risk of 2/10,000 events appears to fall into an intermediate, or tolerability zone, where the risk may be tolerated in return for other (public safety) benefits.</p>

<p>A (defendable) quantitative estimate of the benefits derived from up to five extra years of TRMM data on improvement of storm analysis, forecasting, and public safety could not be developed.  As a result NASA will need to rely on subjective estimates based on expert judgment.<br />
</i></blockquote></p>

<p>So detailed analysis can't answer the question.  What does the "expert judgment" say?  A NASA <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/NI000578/html/20.html">workshop</a> in 2001 came up with this:<blockquote><i>Most, but not all, workshop participants subjectively estimated that the risk to human life of an uncontrolled reentry would be exceeded by the risk to human life of not having TRMM data for operational [forecasting] uses.</i></blockquote></p>

<p>Not unanimous, but an answer!  Despite that, earlier this year, NASA was leaning the other way.  Back in April, the NASA associate administrator for science was prepared to <a href="http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_050620.html">terminate</a> TRMM's mission and start planning for the controlled reentry.  Given the uncertainties, it would have been hard to argue with that decision, even if it wouldn't have been ideal.  TRMM had already been extended an extra year after a previous termination announcement.</p>

<p>But in June, NASA's new top gun, <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=17158">Mike Griffin</a>, overruled that decision, and is "<a href="http://www.space.com/spacenews/businessmonday_050620.html">coordinating</a>" (which I read as 'trying to figure out who's going to pay the relatively small amount of money for it') the extension of TRMM's mission until 2010 or 2011.  At that point, TRMM will be completely out of fuel, unable to preserve its orbit against the drag effect of the thin atmosphere 400 km up, and thus will fall back to Earth of its own volition.</p>

<p>But by then, GPM, the next-generation TRMM, will be ready to take over.</p>

<p>Hopefully no one will be hurt when TRMM comes crashing back through the atmosphere in five or six years.  And hopefully many fewer will be hurt due to the better hurricane tracking that TRMM will enable in the meantime.</p>

		<a href="its_not_the_cit.html">Sink the Urban Archipelago</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Ed Stephan, a sociologist guest-blogging at the Carpetbagger Report, suggests a <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/4652.html">political strategy</a> for the Democratic Party: "It's the cities, stupid."  <br />
<em><blockquote>I think, instead, it's high time we identify with our <strong>Urban Base</strong>, in every state red or blue. We should aim to make ourselves the party of choice for every <strong>urban place</strong> in America.</blockquote></em>(The emphasis is his.)  </p>

<p>His argument, though, strikes me as so wrong, counterproductive, and destructive, that I hardly know where to begin. </p>

<p>Stephan's motivation is two-fold:  (1) Census bureau data show that the "urban" population vastly outnumbers the "rural" population, by a current, and increasing, margin of nearly four to one; and (2) he claims "Urbanites are tolerant (even accepting) of many of the things Republicans brag about hating."</p>

<p>For the Cenus bureau, "urban" (i.e., non-rural) means only <a href="http://ask.census.gov/cgi-bin/askcensus.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=623&p_created=1092150238&p_sid=Tmxpq1Kh&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9NyZwX3Byb2RzPSZwX2NhdHM9JnBfcHY9JnBfY3Y9JnBfcGFnZT0xJnBfc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9dXJiYW4gcnVyYWw*&p_li=&p_topview=1">this</a>:  "An urban area generally consists of a large central place and adjacent densely settled census blocks that together have a total population of at least 2,500 for urban clusters, or at least 50,000 for urbanized areas."  By that definition, no wonder "urbanites" are so dominant.  A population of 2,500 is tiny village by the standards of the areas most people think about when the word urban is used.  </p>

<p>A more useful division would be between true urban (the residents of city cores that Stephan appears to be referring to when he uses the word "urban"), suburban, exurban, and rural.  I don't have numbers handy, but I strongly suspect that the size of the true urban crowd would not dominate that classification.  </p>

<p>Stephan cites, and adopts the conclusions of, a widely-circulated article from immediately after the election last fall called <a href="http://www.urbanarchipelago.com/">The Urban Archipelago</a>.  He calls it "excellent," and "a brilliant analysis."  When I first read it many months ago, though, I came to a very different conclusion.  I found it ridiculously simplistic and full of insulting stereotypes.  Here is a sample:<em><blockquote>Citizens of the Urban Archipelago reject heartland "values" like xenophobia, sexism, racism, and homophobia, as well as the more intolerant strains of Christianity that have taken root in this country. And we are the real Americans. They--rural, red-state voters, the denizens of the exurbs--are not real Americans. They are rubes, fools, and hate-mongers.</blockquote></em><br />
There is much more along those lines:<em><blockquote>The Republicans have the federal government--for now. But we've got Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York City (Bloomberg is a Republican in name only), and every college town in the country. We're everywhere any sane person wants to be. Let them have the shitholes, the Oklahomas, Wyomings, and Alabamas. We'll take Manhattan.</blockquote></em>And how about this gem?<em><blockquote>To red-state voters, to the rural voters, residents of small, dying towns, and soulless sprawling exburbs, we say this: Fuck off.</blockquote></em>That entire article is one big rant about a painful, lost election.  It's essentially arguing for political warfare between big cities and everybody else.  Thanks to the Republicans, we already have that, and Democrats, are on the losing side of that numbers game.  And even if the facts were different and we were winning such a political civil war, the concept of pitting the dominant segment of the population against the rest should be repugnant to American values.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Stephan has not just adopted the conclusions of the authors of <em>The Urban Archipelago</em>, he has adopted some of their divisive, stereotyping attitude as well, as he concludes with this:<em><blockquote>The Democratic Party should focus on cities, leave the stagnating hillbillies to the GOP, and sigh "good riddance".</blockquote></em>Even without the insults, this is simple bad political strategy.  We already get huge majorities in many big cities, and smaller majorities in most of the rest.  Yet that, along with the huge number of non-big-city Democratic voters like myself, is not quite enough to win control of the Federal government.  If our plans for the country are superior, we should be able to convince enough extra suburban voters, exurban voters, rural voters, and brand new voters, to come to our side.</p>

<p>With the insults, forget it.</p>
