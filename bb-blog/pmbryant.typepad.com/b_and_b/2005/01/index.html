		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Not much new, but last week (January 26) the San Antonio Express-News published another <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/neighbors/stories/MYSA012605.1H.nwwalmart.3dcf5b77.html" title="MySA.com: Neighbors">article</a> on the Wal-Mart in Helotes story:</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><strong></strong></span><em>HELOTES — A week after City Council voted to stonewall plans for a Wal-Mart Supercenter on a pastoral slice of property straddling the city boundary and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, store officials say they'd still like to negotiate with the city and residents.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>On Jan. 12, City Council voted 3-2 to have city attorneys draft a moratorium on new commercial development at that intersection, hinging on a traffic study done by the city. It also authorized the city to file suit to prevent development that would be in violation of the public health, safety and welfare of the residents.</em><span class="vitstorybody"> <p><em>It was a move that was met with approval by Helotes and Grey Forest residents who have been pushing the council to fight the retailer.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;To the surprise of the group that was so adamantly opposed to Wal-Mart, the majority of the council supports not having Wal-Mart,&quot; said Helotes Mayor Steve Hodges. &quot;They're looking at it more as a quality-of-life issue than a money issue.&quot;</em></p> <p><em>Any such action could stop development on the site because a sliver of property along Scenic Loop Road rests within the city limits, said city attorney David Earl.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;Their development has presumed an access directly on Scenic Loop Road, and the city has a clear concern for truck traffic and additional traffic on Scenic Loop Road,&quot; Earl said. &quot;Despite raising those concerns, Wal-Mart has never changed the proposal. <br /></em></p> <p><em>&quot;I think the move is prudent and correct given the fact that (the council) has the desire and obligation to protect the integrity of the traffic system within its city limits. In addition, it has the power to enforce traffic regulations in its (extraterritorial jurisdiction.)&quot; <br /></em></p> <p><em>The city also could take legal action based on the Texas Local Government Code that says that the city has a right to prevent any development that would create a nuisance within 5,000 feet, he explained.
&nbsp; <br /></em></p> <p><em>But councilman Jim Caruso, who voted against taking action to thwart Wal-Mart, said the attempt is not a slam-dunk, and the cost of fighting it will rest on taxpayer shoulders. <br /></em></p> <p><em>&quot;My opinion is that by doing that, we weren't being as forthcoming to the citizens of Helotes as the council should have been,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;There was no discussion to let the citizens know that it's a pretty weak effort on our part that could potentially work, but the lawyers weren't really warm and fuzzy about the idea.&quot;
&nbsp; <br /></em></p> <p><em>Caruso said the city turned its back on a good offer that could be an economic boon to the city. If store officials requested annexation to Helotes, city officials have estimated it could mean a gain of more than $1 million in revenues each year.</em></p> <p><em>Now, they will be lucky if Wal-Mart continues to extend an olive branch, Caruso said.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;If you're there to offer the community a supercenter that would boost tax revenues up and are willing to redesign a standard, ugly store into something that looks like old town Helotes and you're willing to meet requirements that the city has instilled on all its businesses ... and somebody bites off your hand, what do you think your reaction would be?&nbsp; I think they are going to stick their middle finger at us and tell us to go to hell,&quot; he said.</em></p></span></p></blockquote><p>Given Wal-Mart's new found love for public relations, I think Caruso is mistaken.&nbsp; But we'll see.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Senator Barbara Boxer posted a <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/1/27/124226/410">diary</a> on Daily Kos to thank the community there for taking the initiative in opposing Bush's nomination of Condoleeza Rice as Secretary of State:</p><blockquote><div class="title2"><strong><em> Thank you so much</em></strong></div>

<p><em>by <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/user/Barbara%20Boxer" class="light">Barbara Boxer</a>

</em><br /><em>Thu Jan 27th, 2005 at 14:11:07 PST</em><br /><em>&nbsp;</em><em><br />I can't thank all of you enough -- the Daily Kos community, and the
blogosphere as a whole -- for all of your effective work during the
recent debate over Condoleezza Rice's nomination. Your support and
participation in this critical debate meant so much to me.
</em></p>

<p><em>More than 94,000 Americans from across the country signed my
petition and stood together to demand the truth from Condoleezza Rice.
It was truly an overwhelming response -- much more than I could have
anticipated. You helped to get our message out to millions of Americans
-- I couldn't have done it without you.
</em></p>

<p><em><strong>And you made a difference.</strong> You gave me the
voice I needed to ask the tough questions during Dr. Rice's
confirmation hearings. And you gave the entire United States Senate the
voice it needed to take its &quot;advice and consent&quot; responsibility
seriously. In fact, Condoleezza Rice received 13 votes against her
confirmation -- the most votes against any Secretary of State's
nomination since 1825. </em></p>

<p><em>Two weeks ago, who would have thought that Condoleezza Rice's
nomination would allow us to have a full debate about our policy in
Iraq? Who would have thought that we'd have the chance to truly expose
all of the misstatements and misjudgments that led us into that
conflict and continue to plague this Administration to this very day? </em></p>

<p><em>The Republican Senate leadership intended to easily approve
Dr. Rice's nomination in a routine voice vote last Thursday afternoon,
after President Bush's Inauguration and before the Inaugural balls got
into full swing.
</em></p>

<p><em><strong>But you didn't let them ram this nomination through the Senate.</strong>
You forced the Republican leadership to give us the debate we wanted on
the floor of the United States Senate, and you gave us the opportunity
we desperately needed to hold Dr. Rice and the Bush Administration
accountable for their failures in Iraq and in the war on terrorism.
</em></p>

<p><em>The American people deserved no less.

</em></p>

<p><em>As you and I both know, this is just one more of the many
battles we'll be having as we fight for our nation's future. It started
with contesting the Ohio vote, it continued with the debate over Dr.
Rice's confirmation, and it will certainly continue over the Gonzalez
nomination and on many other looming issues. We're going to need to
keep working together to make our voices heard and build a better
America.
</em></p>

<p><em>I enjoyed the dialogue we started over the past few weeks,
including the chat I had with Armando and DavidNYC on the eve of the
committee hearings, and I look forward to future interactions with the
Daily Kos community. I hope to have the time to drop by here and
participate in the discussion from time to time -- I value your input,
and I thank you for caring so much about the future of our country.
</em></p>

<p><em>Thanks again for all of your hard work. I can't tell you how
much I appreciate your continued support. And I look forward to
standing with you in the days, weeks, and months ahead.
</em></p>

<p><em>In Friendship,

</em></p>

<p><em>Barbara Boxer</em></p></blockquote><p>It's comforting to see that all this talk on the internet can have an impact on our elected officials.</p>

                                <p>So a couple weeks back, Texas Governor Perry appoints a Republican legislator from San Antonio to the state railroad commission.&nbsp; The special election to fill the seat will be held on February 5.&nbsp; Early voting has already begun.

</p>

<p>Ridiculous, you may say.&nbsp; Until two weeks ago, no one even knew there would be a new election for this seat.&nbsp; How could anyone decide to run for office, mount a campaign, and get elected in such a short time span?

</p>

<p>No doubt, that's the idea, as Ken Rodriguez points out in the <a title="MySA.com: Metro | State" href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA012605.3A.krod.444f545e.html">San Antonio Express-News</a> today:</p><blockquote><p><em>Four candidates are running to succeed Jones, and it is perhaps like no 
race you've ever seen.</em></p>

<p><em>One day the candidates are filing. The next they're practically waiting for returns.</em></p>

<p><em>If you're a new resident of District 121 and want to get to know the candidates — Paul Silber, Rose Spector, Glen S. Starnes and Joe Straus III — forget it.</em> 
<em><span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody">

<p>By the time you read their bios, the polls will be closed. 
</p> <p>If you're new to District 121, all you know for sure is that the winner will be somebody whose last name begins with the letter &quot;S.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p> <p>In a race that begins and ends so quickly, you have almost no chance to win unless you're anointed to win. Which means you need the blessing of the prominent and the powerful.</p>

<p>The anointed one appears to be Straus. In a heavily Republican district, Straus has the support of influential GOP leaders, including U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith.
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></span></span></em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004794.html#004794">Rose Spector</a> is the Democrat in the race.&nbsp; And a prominent one as well, as she was apparently one of the last statewide elected Democrats in Texas, as a Texas Supreme Court Justice in the 1990s.</p>

<p>She's quick, and already has a <a href="http://www.rosespector.com/">campaign website</a> up and running (via <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004830.html">Off the Kuff</a>).&nbsp; We should help her out in this short, uphill race.&nbsp; The district includes Alamo Heights and a good chunk of northeast San Antonio, and, as such, is obviously strongly Republican-leaning.</p>

                                <p>From <a title="Michael Berube Online" href="http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/mister_answer_man/">Michael Berube</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>You’ve got questions, Mister Answer Man has answers.&nbsp; That’s one of
the reasons his name is Mister Answer Man!&nbsp; Let’s go to the mailbag.
</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>Dear Mister Answer Man:&nbsp; In his defense of Harvard president Larry
Summers, Steven Pinker responded to the question, “Were President
Summers’ remarks within the pale of legitimate academic discourse?”
with some exasperation:&nbsp; “Good grief, shouldn’t everything be within
the pale of legitimate academic discourse, as long as it is presented
with some degree of rigor? That’s the difference between a university
and a madrassa.” President Summers had mentioned, in support of the
hypothesis that genetic differences between men and women might play
some part in explaining the dearth of women in the sciences, his
attempt to practice “gender-neutral” parenting by giving his daughter
two trucks, only to find that she named them “daddy truck” and “baby
truck,” almost as if they were dolls.&nbsp; Did Summers’ citation of his
daugher and her trucks meet scientific criteria for “some degree of
rigor”?</strong>&nbsp; --V. Solanas, New York
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Mister Answer Man replies: Yes.&nbsp; The “Two Trucks Test” has long
been recognized as a legitimate-- and singularly revealing-- research
experiment by those who are wise in the ways of science.&nbsp; In some
circles it is as widely used, as a pedagogical tool, as the famous
lightbulb-and-two-apertures demonstration of the quantum nature of
electromagnetic radiation.&nbsp; Additionally, one can discover a young
girl’s aptitude for the sciences by weighing her in relation to the two
trucks:&nbsp; the law of the conservation of matter proves that if a girl
weighs the same as a truck, she is made of wood, and therefore unlikely
to become a scientist or engineer.</em></p></blockquote><p>And from <a href="http://www.michaelberube.com/index.php/weblog/women_barred_from_harvard_presidency_by_genetic_predisposition_study_finds/">last week</a>, more Berube:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Women barred from Harvard presidency by &quot;genetic predisposition,&quot; study finds</em></strong>

</p>

<p><em>CAMBRIDGE, MA (AP)-- Researchers unveiled today a <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/some_man_needs_to_calculate_the_rotation_velocity_of_mlks_corpse_immediatel/">startling new study</a>
that suggests women are “extremely unlikely” to become president of
Harvard University, and that women’s “distinctive genetic makeup” plays
“a decisive role” in preventing them from becoming top-level
administrators at the nation’s oldest college.
</em></p>

<p><em>“Traditionally, presidents of Harvard have been men,” said Harvard
geneticist Charles Kinbote, the study’s designer and principal
investigator.&nbsp; “Now, after almost 400 years, we know why.&nbsp; To coin a
phrase, it’s in the genes.”
</em></p>

<p><em>According to Kinbote, the presidency of Harvard University requires
a unique array of talents and dispositions which, statistically, only a
small handful of women possess.&nbsp; “For one thing,” noted Kinbote, “it
has long been one of the president’s tasks to deny tenure to promising
female scholars-- personally, without stated cause, and after a
department, a college, and a battery of external referees has approved
her.&nbsp; My study shows that the X chromosome contains material that, in
combination with another X chromosome, inhibits a person’s ability to
do this.”
</em></p>

<p><em>Men are also more adept than women at mentally rotating
three-dimensional shapes on aptitude tests, Kinbote added.&nbsp; “You’d be
surprised how often a university president needs to do this, and at
Harvard the pressure is especially intense.” Kinbote estimated that the
president of Harvard spends roughly one-quarter of the working day
mentally rotating complex, hypothetical three-dimensional shapes, “and
that’s not even counting all the time he needs to try to figure out why
women aren’t as skilled at abstract mathematical thought.”
</em></p>

<p><em>The X chromosome also seems to play a role in suppressing the
ability to make fatuous remarks in public forums.&nbsp; “If you want to be
president of Harvard,” Kinbote said, “you have to be willing to get up
there and just let it fly, no matter what the facts are and no matter
what the consequences may be.&nbsp; Not just in off-the-cuff remarks--
anybody can do that-- but in carefully considered, prepared
statements.&nbsp; It appears that once again, the X chromosome works, when
paired with another X, as an inhibiting factor in all but a tiny
fraction of the female population.” That tiny fraction, Kinbote
suggested, would be the subject of a subsequent study into the
biochemical basis of Coulter Syndrome.</em></p></blockquote><p></p>

                                <p>From Sean Carroll, a physicist at my alma mater, the University of Chicago, who writes a blog called <a title="Preposterous Universe" href="https://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2005_01_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#110623487218008498">Preposterous Universe</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>So, except for the fact that &quot;scientific ability&quot; is something
hopelessly hard to quantify, I'm happy to contemplate the possibility
that men have some tiny innate superiority to women when it comes to
science. I am equally happy to contemplate the possibility that women
have some tiny innate superiority to men when it comes to science. The
point is that we have no strong evidence one way or another. It's
impossible, given the current state of the art, to reliably measure
&quot;innate ability&quot; in a way that isn't hopelessly noisy and compromised
by cultural factors. It's perfectly clear that the differences between
individual people are typically much larger than the difference between
some hypothetical average man and average woman, just as it is
perfectly obvious that the expression of innate ability is tremendously
affected by social and cultural factors.</em></p></blockquote><p>Howard Georgi of Harvard University has an essary published in the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=505377">Harvard Crimson</a> today that makes a similar argument:</p><blockquote><p><span class="a-text"><p><em>1 - Talent is not a unitary thing. It is multidimensional and difficult to measure or quantify precisely.</em></p>

<p><em>2
- Many different kinds of talents are critical to the advancement of
physics or any other science interesting enough to be worth doing.</em></p>

<p><em>3
- The spread of talents within any group, sex, race, etc, is very large
compared to any small average differences that may exist between such
groups. </em></p>

<p><em>4 - Talent can to be developed and enhanced by education, encouragement, self-confidence and hard work.</em></p>

<p><em>For
these reasons, I think that it is not particularly useful to talk about
innate differences to explain the differences in representation of
various groups in physics. Instead, I conclude that we need to try
harder to teach science in a way that nourishes as many different
skills as possible.</em></p></span></p></blockquote><p>These arguments totally demolish the concept that &quot;innate scientific ability&quot; is anything we can hope to measure with any degree of confidence.&nbsp; Those defending Harvard President Summers' comments on the basis that he was allegedly merely asking for more research in this area are misguided.</p>

<p>Anyone defending Summers' dismissal of discrimination is even more mistaken.&nbsp; Sean Carroll continues:</p><blockquote><p><span class="a-text"><p><em>Don't these people read
any history at all? Whenever some group is discriminated against by
some other group, people inevitably suggest that the differences in
situation can be traced to innate features distinguishing between the
groups, and <span style="font-style: italic;">they are never right!&nbsp; </span>If
you would like to suggest that innate differences are responsible for
some current discrepancies in people's fortunes, the minimal burden you
face is to acknowledge that such explanations have been spectacular
failures in similar circumstances throughout history, and explain why
we have compelling reasons to think the situation is different this
time. Maybe it is, but the presumption is strongly against you.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Systematic biases against women in science are real.</span> I've talked about this <a href="https://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_preposterousuniverse_archive.html#108148346854964196">before</a>,
so didn't think it was worth rehearsing, but apparently there are a lot
of folks who don't quite see it. They must not be looking.</em></p></span></p></blockquote><p>Like I did <a href="the_problem_goe.html">earlier</a>, but more eloquently, Carroll finds fault with Summers' argument that discrimination is not a significant cause of gender disparities:</p><blockquote><p><em>Summers, of course, casually dismisses the idea that differences
between the representation of men and women in science can be traced to
systematic biases. His argument is based on rational markets: if there
were a lot of talented women out there who were being discriminated
against, a clever university could dominate the competition by hiring
them all up, but this doesn't happen. This is the kind of idea so dumb
that it could only be entertained by a professional economist. By
similar logic, shouldn't smart baseball executives in the first half of
the twentieth century been able to win multiple World Series by simply
scooping up all of the African-American players that their racist
colleagues were reluctant to hire?</em></p></blockquote><p>Clearly, it's time to add <a href="https://preposterousuniverse.blogspot.com/">Preposterous Universe</a> and PZ Myers' <a href="http://pharyngula.org/">Pharyngula</a> (who comes through with another excellent <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/sexist_calvinism/">post</a> today on this subject) to my blogroll (that's the list of blogs on the left side of this page to those of you unfamiliar with the term).&nbsp; And time to remove <a href="the_problem_goe.html">Mark Kleiman</a>.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Harvard president Larry Summers misrepresented, or at best ignored, the results of a sociological study in his talk earlier this week in which he claimed the possibility of innate differences in mathematical and scientific ability between men and women.&nbsp; Garance Franke-Ruta at The American Prospect's blog <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2005/01/index.html#005283" title="TAPPED: January 2005 Archives">TAPPED</a> highlights an article in the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/today/article505363.html">Harvard Crimson</a> from Wednesday that says this:</p><blockquote><p><em><span class="a-text">Two sociologists whose research University
President Lawrence H. Summers cited at an economics conference Friday
said yesterday their findings do not support Summers’ suggestion that
“innate differences” may account for the under-representation of women
in the sciences. <p>University
of California-Davis sociologist Kimberlee A. Shauman said that Summers’
remarks were “uninformed.” The other researcher, University of Michigan
sociologist Yu Xie, said he accepted Summers’ comments as “scholarly
propositions,” although he said his own analysis “goes against Larry’s
suggestion that math ability is something innate.”</p>

<p>Xie and
Shauman presented their findings at the National Bureau of Economic
Research Friday afternoon, shortly after Summers’ remarks.</p>

<p>In an
interview with The Crimson last night, Summers stressed that he only
cited Xie and Shauman’s research as evidence that females are
underrepresnted among the top 5 percent of test-takers on standardized
assessments. Summers said the evidence for his speculative hypothesis
that biological differences may partially account for this gender gap
comes instead from scholars cited in Johnstone Family Professor of
Psychology Steven Pinker’s bestselling 2002 book The Blank Slate: The
Modern Denial of Human Nature.
</p></span></em></p></blockquote><p>So Summers' defense is that he didn't misrepresent Xie and Shauman's work, he just ignored it in favor of Steven Pinker's book.&nbsp; As for that book, Franke-Ruta writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>I haven't read this book, but if you look at the amazon.com readers'
comments, it appears that some female readers found its discussions of
rape and the maternal instinct highly offensive and sexist. <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/scienceandnature/0,6121,792159,00.html">One newspaper reviewer</a>
described Pinker's book, in 2002, as &quot;breathtaking, rabid stuff....
likely to reduce most university common-rooms to states of gibbering
apoplexy.&quot; (Mission accomplished, clearly.) If Summers based his
remarks in part on a reading of Pinker's book, the response he
generated was something that was not only predictable but predicted.</em></p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Summers is trying to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/01/21/summers_harvard_faculty_meet/">smooth things over</a>, at least with his colleagues at Harvard:</p><blockquote><p><em>Continuing efforts to soothe professors angry about his remarks on
women, the president of Harvard University, Lawrence H. Summers, met
last night with faculty members who wrote to him this week that his
comments would hurt Harvard's ability to recruit top female scholars.</em></p>

<p><em>
Summers repeated the apology he has made at least twice in writing, according to spokeswoman Lucie McNeil.</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;It was a good meeting,&quot; she said. &quot;He apologized, and they moved on to
a discussion of a variety of steps the university can take to address
the issues, and they agreed to continue to address them in the coming
days.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>
Between a half-dozen and a dozen professors, members of Harvard's
official Standing Committee on Women, attended yesterday evening's
hourlong meeting at the Barker Center for the Humanities.</em></p>

<p><em>
The participants were reluctant to discuss details of the meeting for
fear of jeopardizing their ongoing discussions with Summers.</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;It was a constructive discussion on very difficult issues of
importance to the university,&quot; said Caroline Hoxby, a professor of
economics. &quot;The discussion is ongoing, and we believe there will be
some resolution on important issues next week.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Finally, the National Organization for Women, along with a certain female member of my household, yesterday <a href="http://www.now.org/press/01-05/01-20-Harvard.html">called</a> for Summers' resignation:</p><blockquote><p><em>The National Organization for Women calls for the resignation of
Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, who has failed to lead
the prominent (and previously all-male) university toward true
inclusion of women. His recent comments generated a firestorm of
response from Harvard/Radcliffe women who were outraged that he would
embarrass Harvard with such a public demonstration of sexism and
ignorance.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Summers' suggestion that women are inferior to men in their ability
to excel at math and science is more than an example of personal
sexism, it is a clue to why women have not been more fully accepted and
integrated into the tenured faculty at Harvard since he has been
president,&quot; said NOW President Kim Gandy. According to reports, the
number of female faculty receiving tenure has declined over the past
four years — down to just four of the last 32 tenure offers in the
school's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Harvard University holds itself out as the pinnacle of higher
education in this country,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;Such an esteemed institution
should set a standard for other colleges and universities — a standard
that Lawrence Summers appears unable to maintain.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Certainly, as UCLA professor Mark Kleiman's recent <a href="the_problem_goe.html">comments</a> illustrate, Summers' attitude of male superiority is far from unique in the academic world—and not even the worst example.&nbsp; So Summers' resignation as Harvard president alone will not solve anything.&nbsp; But his resignation is a necessary step for the fair treatment of women in acadmics, precisely because of the prevalence of this attitude.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A modestly prominent, moderately liberal academic blogger has weighed in on the controversy regarding the comments of Harvard president Larry Summers on the sparsity of women in academic science and engineering positions (see this <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/01/17/summers_remarks_on_women_draw_fire?mode=PF">article</a> from Monday's Boston Globe and these <a href="havard_presiden.html">earlier</a> <a href="a_good_rant_on_.html">posts</a> for the details).&nbsp; Unfortunately, this blogger, <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/">Mark A. R. Kleiman</a>, a professor of policy studies at UCLA, who I've been reading for over a year and whose writings I generally respect, has weighed in firmly on the wrong side.&nbsp; Even more repulsive, an argument he proffers could be used to justify male domination of every skilled field of endeavor.</p>

<p>First, here is an excerpt of what <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/_/2005/01/larry_summerss_gaffe.php">Kleiman</a> says about Summers' comments:</p><blockquote><p><em>My reader says:</em></p>

<p><em>1. Summers does or should realize that he is never speaking just as
an intellectual or as an economist, and that it is possible (and I mean
possible) that his comments were incompatible with his role as
President.</em></p>

<p><em>2.&nbsp; The content of his remarks seems entirely unobjectionable and probably true.</em></p>

<p><em>3. The behavior of those who walked out or condemned him is truly
regrettable and I am disappointed that it has not sparked more comment.</em></p>

<p><em>I agree with #2 and #3 entirely, and #1 in part. The President of
Harvard needs to mind his manners and to make sure that he speaks in
ways that are less likely, rather than more likely, to lead to
pernicious misinterpretation. But this should be a matter of form, not
substance. It should not be inconsistent with the function of a
university president to make true statements on important issues.</em></p></blockquote><p>True statements?&nbsp; Entirely unobjectionable?&nbsp; Let's review what Summers said, based on the Boston Globe <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/01/17/summers_remarks_on_women_draw_fire?mode=PF">article</a> that initially publicized his words:</p><blockquote><p><em>Summers spoke during a working lunch. He declined to provide a tape
or transcript of his remarks, but the description he gave in an
interview was generally in keeping with what 10 participants recalled.
He said he was synthesizing the scholarship that the organizers had
asked him to discuss, and that in his talk he repeated several times:
''I'm going to provoke you.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>He offered three possible explanations, in declining order of
importance, for the small number of women in high-level positions in
science and engineering. The first was the reluctance or inability of
women who have children to work 80-hour weeks.</em></p>
<p><em>The second point was that fewer girls than boys have top scores on
science and math tests in late high school years. ''I said no one
really understands why this is, and it's an area of ferment in social
science,&quot; Summers said in an interview Saturday. ''Research in
behavioral genetics is showing that things people previously attributed
to socialization weren't&quot; due to socialization after all.</em></p>
<p><em>This was the point that most angered some of the listeners, several
of whom said Summers said that women do not have the same ''innate
ability&quot; or ''natural ability&quot; as men in some fields.</em></p>
<p><em>Asked about this, Summers said, ''It's possible I made some
reference to innate differences. . . I did say that you have to be
careful in attributing things to socialization. . . That's what we
would prefer to believe, but these are things that need to be studied.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Summers said cutting-edge research has shown that genetics are more
important than previously thought, compared with environment or
upbringing. As an example, he mentioned autism, once believed to be a
result of parenting but now widely seen to have a genetic basis.</em></p>
<p><em>In his talk, according to several participants, Summers also used as
an example one of his daughters, who as a child was given two trucks in
an effort at gender-neutral parenting. Yet she treated them almost like
dolls, naming one of them ''daddy truck,&quot; and one ''baby truck.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>Summers' third point was about discrimination. Referencing a
well-known concept in economics, he said that if discrimination was the
main factor limiting the advancement of women in science and
engineering, then a school that does not discriminate would gain an
advantage by hiring away the top women who were discriminated against
elsewhere.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Because that doesn't seem to be a widespread phenomenon, Summers
said, ''the real issue is the overall size of the pool, and it's less
clear how much the size of the pool was held down by discrimination.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Summers ended his talk by describing some of the efforts Harvard is
making to improve its hiring record and help women balance work and
family.</em></p>

<p><em>''I believe that it's an important part of what I do to encourage
frank scientific discussion,&quot; he said. ''I would hope and trust that no
one could [doubt] that we are absolutely committed to promoting the
diversity of the faculty.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>So Summers, using only theoretical economic hand-waving, essentially dismisses discrimination completely.&nbsp; His argument, as related here, neglects all the factors that contribute to advancement that are outside the control of the individual and the institution that hired her.&nbsp; Advancement in science requires not just an employer, but collaboration opportunities, published papers, and funded grant proposals.&nbsp; Summers' hypothetical non-discriminatory school could not obtain any advantage by hiring talented women shunned at leading institutions if the women continued to be shunned by the leaders in their field.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Summers then fills the vacuum that his dismissal of discrimination creates by elevating some alleged innate female inferiority.&nbsp; That such sexist arguments can still be put forward by supposedly serious people like Summers, and accepted as &quot;entirely unobjectionable&quot; by other supposedly serious people like Kleiman, shows how far the fight against gender discrimination has yet to go.&nbsp; Someone making similar suggestions that racial disparities might be due to inferiority of certain races would, and should, lose professional respect and likely their job (unless they work for a conservative <a href="http://www.aei.org/scholars/scholarID.43,filter.all/scholar.asp">think tank</a>, of course).</p>

<p>Alas, Kleiman takes his argument further into the depths:</p><blockquote><p><em>That invidious gender bias and skewed social arrangements exist it
would be hard to doubt without deliberately closing one's eyes and
ears. But that those problems explain most of the underrepresentation
of women among tenured scientists and mathematicians is open to doubt.</em></p>

<p><em>Matt [Yglesias, blogger and journalist] misstates the evidence about the relative skills of the two
sexes in a subtle but important way. What matters isn't the difference
in central tendencies between the two distributions, but rather their
dispersion around that central tendency.</em></p>

<p><em>For excellent evolutionary reasons, human males display higher
variance than human females on many important traits, including
measures of mental capacity. That means that they are likely to
predominate among the top one hundredth of one percent of almost any
cognitive talent, unless women are on average much better endowed in
that particular department. </em></p>

<p><em>So it wouldn't be surprising to find that women, on average, write
better than men do, but that there are more men than women among the
handful of the very best writers in the world</em>.</p></blockquote><p>I'll skip over the supreme, albeit typical in academics, arrogance that is evident in Kleiman's implicit assumption that academic positions are reserved for the &quot;top hundredth of one percent.&quot;&nbsp; But with this argument, Kleiman appears to excuse male domination of every skilled field into eternity.</p>

<p>Exhibit A in the academic glass ceiling:&nbsp; Larry Summers.</p>

<p>Exhibit B:&nbsp; Mark Kleiman.</p>

<p>Exhibit C:&nbsp; Far too many other men.</p>

<p>It would be nice to see some evidence that these men have ever listened to a significant number—or even any—academic or other professional women about their experiences in building their careers.&nbsp; I know a few who might be able to educate them.<br /> </p><blockquote></blockquote>

<p><a title="Pharyngula::Some MAN needs to calculate the rotational velocity of MLK’s corpse, immediately!" href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/some_man_needs_to_calculate_the_rotation_velocity_of_mlks_corpse_immediatel/">Pharyngula</a>, who appears to be a male scientist at a university in Minnesota:</p><blockquote><p><em>I’ll tell you how much of a role discrimination plays in limiting
female professors in so-called “elite” universities: 100%. There is no
shortage of brilliant women scientists (or brilliant male scientists),
but there is a dearth of jobs and we still have bigoted ignoramuses
like Summers standing guard over the gateways.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://bitchphd.blogspot.com/2005/01/newsflash-lawrence-summers-is-dick.html">Bitch, Ph.D.</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Having said that his hypothesis is &quot;based on . . . scholarly work,&quot;
Summers goes on to offer this incredibly scholarly piece of evidence:<br /><br />&quot;In

example one of his daughters, who as a child was given two trucks in an

the &quot;Mama Plane&quot; and the &quot;Baby Plane.&quot; Click on the link, you'll see
why. So I think maybe a little more research needs to be done on this
topic before your darling daughter--who I'm sure was raised in a
completely non-sexist environment (not)--can really serve as definitive
proof that girls can't do math and science.<br /><br />Dumbass.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://feministing.com/archives/000823.html">Feministing</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Women at the conference—which was about women and minorities in
science and engineering—were less than pleased. Nancy Hopkins, a
biologist at MIT, walked out on his talk, saying that if she hadn't she
“would've either blacked out or thrown up.” </em></p>

<p><em>And I have to say, I don’t buy Summers’ attempt to spin his comments
as “hypotheses,” especially after learning that the number of tenured
job offers made to Harvard women has dropped significantly since he
took office. What a coincidence…</em> </p></blockquote>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Lawrence Summers, the president of Harvard University, has apparently ignited quite a firestorm about why women are so severely underrepresented in science and engineering academic positions.&nbsp; Here is a brief summary of what he said, according to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/19/education/19harvard.html?incamp=article_popular_4">New York Times</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em> At Friday's conference, Mr. Summers discussed possible reasons so
few women were on the science and engineering faculties at research
universities, and he said he would be provocative. </em></p>

<p><em>Among his hypotheses were that faculty positions at elite
universities required more time and energy than married women with
children were willing to accept, that innate sex differences might
leave women less capable of succeeding at the most advanced mathematics
and that discrimination may also play a role, participants said. There
was no transcript of his remarks.</em></p>

<p><em> His remarks caused one professor to walk out and another to openly challenge them.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Summers has apparently moved into damage control mode:</p><blockquote><p><em>At the center of the storm, Mr. Summers posted a statement late
Monday night on his Web page, saying that his comments at the National
Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit economic research organization
in Cambridge had been misconstrued and pledging to continue efforts to
&quot;attract and engage outstanding women scientists.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em> &quot;My aim at the conference was to underscore that the situation is
likely the product of a variety of factors and that further research
can help us better understand their interplay,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not
presume to have confident answers, only the conviction that the harder
we work to research and understand the situation, the better the
prospects for long term success.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Alas, there is no transcript available, so I don't know exactly what he said, but based on this reporting, I wonder whether Summers has ever seriously talked to female university scientists and engineers about their workplace experiences.&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote><p><em> Maud Lavin, who graduated from Harvard in the class of 1976, was
one of the first women to take a demanding theoretical math sequence,
Math 11 and Math 55, and is an associate professor at the School of the
Art Institute of Chicago. Ms Lavin said in an interview yesterday that
she would not donate any more money to Harvard as long as Mr. Summers
was president, after firing off an angry e-mail message to him.</em></p>

<p><em> &quot;I am offended and furious about your remarks on women in science
and mathematics,&quot; Ms. Lavin wrote. &quot;Arguments of innate gender
difference in math are hogwash and indirectly serve to feed the
virulent prejudices still alas very alive and now even more so due to
your ill-informed remarks.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Sadly, Summers' dismissive attitude toward gender discrimination is
still extremely common among men, even those who should know better. 
Fortunately, his eagerness to explain away discrimination by appealing
to notions of female inferiority is much rarer these days.&nbsp; Well, at
least voicing such an opinion is rare.</p>

<p>But perhaps some good will come out of all this:</p><blockquote><p><em> On and off the campus, Mr. Summers's remarks were the subject of heated debate yesterday. </em></p>

<p><em>Denice D. Denton, the dean of engineering at the University of
Washington who confronted Mr. Summers over his remarks at the
conference, said that her phone had not stopped ringing and that she
had received scores of e-mail messages on the subject. She said Mr.
Summers's remarks might have put new energy into a longstanding effort
to improve the status of women in the sciences. </em></p>

<p><em>&quot;I think they've provoked an intellectual tsunami,&quot; Dr. Denton said.</em> </p></blockquote><p>Enough of one to wake huge numbers of men up from both their patronizing attitude towards women and from their ignorance of the existence and affects of gender discrimination?&nbsp; I sure hope so.

                                <p>Seems I missed this <a title="MySA.com: Environment | Water" href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA011305.3B.helotes_walmart.1cdcb59.html">update</a> on the Helotes Scenic Loop Wal-Mart story in the San Antonio Express-News last week.&nbsp; The headline is &quot;Wal-Mart plan stalled in Helotes&quot;.</p><blockquote><p>HELOTES — The City Council late Wednesday imposed a moratorium on the site along Scenic Loop Road where Wal-Mart intended to build a store, saying a traffic study is needed first.</p>



<p>The decision came after Wal-Mart representatives attended Wednesday's special meeting, determined to hear what residents had to say.</p>

<p>The majority of the 300-plus people at the Helotes 4-H Center gave Wal-Mart plenty to listen to.
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody">
&nbsp; &nbsp; <p>&quot;You have to realize that a lot of animosity out here from citizens of Helotes is we just don't want Wal-Mart out here,&quot; Jon Allan, a Helotes Heritage Association founder, said to rousing cheers from the audience and a standing ovation.
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>His sentiments were echoed by a stream of residents lined up to voice their opposition. Helotes Mayor Steve Hodges called for the special session Dec. 2 in response to protests and numerous e-mails from residents angry about the proposed Wal-Mart.</p></span></span></p></blockquote><p>On the <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.org/">Helotes Heritage Association</a> web site, there is a quote from the assocation's president saying, &quot;We've won a skirmish but not the war.&quot;</p>
