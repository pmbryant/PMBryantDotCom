		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the San Antonio Express-News today, the GOP Texas Agricultural Commissioner, Susan Combs, <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA041405.07B.combscommen.1d4c661dd.html">continues</a> the push by real estate developers to compel taxpayers to pay them not to pollute our water supplies.&nbsp; The arguments are the same flawed ones that these alleged &quot;property rights&quot; advocates have been using for years, and that I wrote about <a href="../../yet_more_antilo.html">last week</a> when Combs and her co-conspirators, including the Texas Landowners Conservancy, a deceptive coalition of <a href="../../what_is_the_tex.html">real estate developers and land speculators</a>, introduced their bill in the Texas legislature.<br /><br />Combs writes:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>
As environmental regulations in some parts of our state have grown more 
stringent over the past two decades or so, the definition of what 
constitutes &quot;takings&quot; has blurred. We are at a critical point where some 
types of environmental regulations are, in effect, takings because they 
cause dramatic devaluation of private property.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>If such regulations are for the betterment of the general public, then 
the landowner who pays a dear price in loss of value should, under both 
state and federal constitutions, be compensated fairly.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Typically for &quot;takings&quot; advocates, Combs completely neglects all the benefits that rules about appropriate land use confer on property owners.&nbsp; For instance, regulations to protect the environment serve to make the area a more desirable place to live and work and thus to increase property values.&nbsp; To be consistent, Combs should advocate that landowners compensate governments and their taxpayers when such rules raise property values.</p>

<p>Combs wants developers to enjoy all the benefits of being part of a community, with none of the responsibility.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are two potential scenarios if her bill becomes law:<br /> </p>

<ul><li>Combs Case 1:&nbsp; Cities regulate land use to make their community a desirable place for all and so boosting land values, yet are forced to pay developers huge amounts of money merely to behave as responsible citizens.&nbsp; Developers thus enjoy a double benefit, while the community at large pays handsomely. </li></ul>

<ul><li>Combs Case 2:&nbsp; Cities cannot afford land use regulations; developers subdivide, pave, and rake in the dough.&nbsp; In the long term, water supplies become polluted, ugly development proliferates, quality of life decreases, and land values are depressed.&nbsp; The developers have already run off with their money, while the community at large pays in all these indirect ways.</li></ul>

<p>In both of these cases, developers and land speculators reap huge benefits at the expense of the general public and the taxpayers.&nbsp; <br /> </p>

<p><a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/gelpi/papers/PRandWP.htm">John Echeverria</a> of the Georgetown Enivronmental Law and Policy Institute points out some of the flaws in arguments such as Combs' in a 2001 article:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
[I]n demanding public payment as a condition of refraining from harming our environment, takings advocates seek unfair windfalls at public expense. After all, reasonable environmental standards benefit everyone, including private property owners. In addition, much of the value of private property is created by nearby public investments, and it is hardly fair for owners to demand payments from the public based on speculative value created in part by the public in the first place.

</em></p>

<p><em>This argument for the legitimacy of public regulation of the uses of private property suggests no disrespect for private property as an institution or its importance to the proper functioning of our economy. One of the key purposes of government is to safeguard property owners against theft and fraud. But the public's role in safeguarding private property rights goes hand in hand with the public's authority to ensure that those rights are exercised responsibly.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Fortunately, a majority of the current Supreme
Court recognizes the beneficial aspect of environmental
regulations, as Echeverria relates in an <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/gelpi/papers/HCN.htm">article</a> about a 2002 Supreme Court decision about a development moratorium for the land surrouding Lake Tahoe:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The decision also expressly affirmed the validity of
the principle that owners subject to regulatory restrictions enjoy a
&quot;reciprocity of advantage&quot; with their neighbors.&nbsp; While any particular
owner may feel burdened by restrictions, she or he also receives
implicit compensation from the neighbors' compliance with the same or
similar restrictions.</em></p>

<p><em>In the Tahoe case, the court questioned whether land owners had
suffered any actual economic loss; after all, the court reasoned, the
moratorium provided the opportunity to prepare a comprehensive plan to
protect the natural resources that made the basin a desirable place to
invest in the first place, increasing property values for all.</em></p></blockquote><p>How about this scenario as an alternative to the bleak Combs scenarios:</p>

<p>Echeverria Case 1:&nbsp; Cities regulate land use to make their community a desirable place for
all and so boosting land values, <del>yet are forced to pay
developers huge amounts of money merely to behave as responsible
citizens.&nbsp; Developers thus enjoy a double benefit, while the community
at large pays handsomely</del>.&nbsp; Everyone, including developers and other landowners, benefits accordingly.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This is an amazing story from the Associated Press about <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=542&amp;ncid=716&amp;e=5&amp;u=/ap/20050411/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/aids_research_safety">official misconduct</a> of many different types at the National Institutes of Health.&nbsp; The allegations include sexual harrassment, a hostile workplace, abuse of taxpayer funds, lax attention to safety standards, retaliation against a whistleblower.&nbsp; Apparently all of this is coming out now due to testimony provided in a congressional investigation into the whistleblower's claims.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the article throws everything together in a big mess, so it is hard to keep it all straight.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
WASHINGTON - 
A boss sends a red bra to a former female subordinate who had a falling
out with him. Government e-mails distribute profanity and a picture of
a partly nude woman. An order to better protect patients in a medical
experiment takes two years to complete.
</em></p>

<p><em>
All of that happened inside the National Institutes of Health, the nation's premier medical research agency, according to sworn testimony and other documents obtained by The Associated Press from a variety of sources inside and outside the NIH.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Two senior female officers testified that the NIH workplace is so uncomfortable and intimidating that safety concerns are frequently dismissed and some employees are afraid to speak up. 
</em></p>

<p><em>
...
</em></p>

<p><em>
 Documents tell of women being hugged or kissed by bosses, or being subjected to catcalls in the hallway. In one instance, a supervisor invited a colleague to a West Coast rock concert and suggested they also visit an AIDS clinic there so the trip could be charged to taxpayers.
</em></p>

<p><em>
[NIH medical officer Betsy] Smith and the top regulatory compliance officer in the NIH's AIDS division, Mary Anne Luzar, stepped forward in interviews with investigators and in sworn depositions in recent weeks and expanded upon allegations made last year by an agency whistleblower, Dr. Jonathan Fishbein. Their videotaped testimony was given in Fishbein's lawsuit against the agency.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Fishbein alleges he is in the process of being fired as the AIDS division's chief of human research protection because he raised concerns about patient safety and shoddy science. NIH says he was fired for poor performance.
</em></p>

<p><em>
The Senate and the inspector general at the Health and Human Services Department are investigating the allegations. In addition, officials told the AP that NIH is conducting an internal investigation on sexual harassment. 
</em></p>

<p><em>
...
</em></p>

<p><em>
Luzar, the AIDS division's compliance officer, alleged that her bosses frequently sided with the front-line researchers they are financing, rather than with the agency's safety and regulatory experts. 
</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;I think we (safety officials) got in the way, and that we were an impediment to the science,&quot; Luzar testified. She described the division managers as &quot;totally unsupportive&quot; of safety concerns and bending to &quot;tremendous pressure&quot; from drug companies and researchers in the name of trying to cure AIDS.
</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;I think the culture was certainly strong for a period of time that the ends could justify the means,&quot; she testified.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Smith said Fishbein was a strong advocate for improving safety for research participants and the effort to fire him is &quot;a warning to other individuals.&quot;
</em></p>

<p><em>
After Fishbein was forced out, she said, NIH held a meeting at which he and his allegations were attacked and a picture of one of Fishbein's relatives was shown on a screen. Smith said the event was so intimidating that fellow safety and medical officers &quot;called it scientific terrorism.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>(Via <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=229x1167">Democratic Underground</a>.)</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Daily Kos has been engaged in a rhetorical war against the more conservative side of the Democratic party lately, especially against Joe Lieberman and the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC).&nbsp; That is a large part of the <a href="../../../../2004/12/the_one_and_onl.html">reason</a> why a blog that was once was a daily must-read from me is only now an optional weekly, glance-it-over.&nbsp; I certainly am not a conservative Democrat, and Joe Lieberman is one of my least favorite Democratic Senators, but I have extremely little patience for pointless infighting at this time.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/4/13/16489/4501">post</a> today, kos uses a press release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee as the only evidence in another attack on Lieberman and the DLC.&nbsp; And then proceeds to label them as &quot;tools of the GOP.&quot;

</p>

<p>Hold on there, kos.&nbsp; Who exactly is the one using a GOP propaganda piece to attack Democrats?</p>

<p>Alas, this is not an isolated case of bad judgement.&nbsp; Just <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/4/11/164720/551">yesterday</a>, kos used similar right-wing propaganda to further his ongoing attacks on Joe Lieberman.&nbsp; See, some unknown conservative group ran a TV ad trashing Jimmy Carter, John Kerry, and Ted Kennedy and happened to include a picture of Lieberman alongside Ronald Reagan, Oliver North, and John Bolton.&nbsp; Kos highlighted this picture with the comment &quot;Lieberman in good company,&quot; and buried the source behind a link.<br /> </p>

<p>Twice in two days, kos has allowed himself to be used by GOP agents to help split Democrats.&nbsp; With his large readership, I sincerely hope he won't allow it to happen again.</p>

<p>Pink Dome's recommendations:</p><blockquote><p><em>These bills serve no public purpose but allow developers to build at
higher densities for higher profits than ever before. SB 848/HB 1704
are developer dream bills that destroy local control of development and
water quality.</em></p>

<p><em>Your help is crucial to STOPPING these bills. Here’s what you can do:</em></p>

<p><em>1) Call your State Senator Tuesday Morning before 11 a.m. That is the
only way they will know you OPPOSE 848 before they go to the Senate
floor.</em></p>

<p><em>2) Call your State Representative next and tell them you OPPOSE HB 1704.</em></p>

<p><em>3) Come to the GEAA [<a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/">Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance</a>] press conference on these bills at the Capitol, E1.002 at Noon on Tuesday.</em></p></blockquote><p>I have some phone calls to make.</p>

that runs along an almost untouched waterway in the midst of a rapidly 
developing area.
</p>
<p>
The entrance to the 364-acre park is on the east side of Texas 16 just 
north of the river. It will open to the public today starting with an 11 
a.m. ceremony.
</p>
<p>
If all goes as planned, the park will lead past another large natural 
area, the new Toyota plant, a sanctuary for migratory birds and the 
proposed Texas A&amp;M University campus before ending at Mission Espada.</p></em></p></blockquote><p>I'm intrigued by this mention of &quot;another large natural area,&quot; but haven't yet found out what is being referred to there.&nbsp; The bird sanctuary mentioned is no doubt <a href="http://www.saws.org/environmental/mitchelllake/">Mitchell Lake</a>, which has recently been opened to the public on Saturdays.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The new Toyota truck plant that will be operational in a couple years
is apparently adjacent to the new Medina River Park, but the size of
park sounds large enough to help minimize the feeling of being next to
a huge industrial complex.&nbsp; I'll find out soon enough, I suppose.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
Today, colorful wildflowers planted to help control erosion abound all the way down from the park entrance to the river, which itself is lined by large trees including cypress and cottonwoods.

<br /><br />&quot;We have nature parks in town in the north and northwest areas but there's no running water generally,&quot; Matthews [the city's parks and recreation director] said.&nbsp; &quot;This has always got water in it and it's just a totally different environment.&quot;

<br /><br />City Councilman Richard Perez described the park as a gorgeous and peaceful place. He said that although he's been promoting it to every neighborhood group that he meets with, few people seem to realize the South Side will finally have a place for residents and their children to appreciate nature.

<br /><br />&quot;No one knows about it,&quot; Perez said. &quot;I have a feeling that once people start going out there the parking lot is going to be packed.&quot; </em></p></blockquote>

<p>Oddly enough, the existence of this new park is directly connected to the water politics in San Antonio that I have <a href="../../edwards_aquifer.html">written</a> about recently.&nbsp; The land for this park was once planned to be flooded as part of the controversial Applewhite Reservoir project.&nbsp; This was a 1980s-era project that the city of San Antonio dreamed up to lessen its dependence on Edwards aquifer water.&nbsp; But <a href="http://www.accd.edu/pac/lrc/chicanaleaders/berriozabal.htm">many</a> believed that this was a poorly-conceived project that would encourage development over the Edwards aquifer recharge zone and thus pollute the city's primary water source.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Applewhite Reservoir project got far enough for the local water agency, SAWS, to purchase land, but then was narrowly rejected by voters in a 1991 referendum.&nbsp; The city tried to revive the project, but voters killed it again in 1994, and that was that.&nbsp; By the time I moved to town in 1998, it was referred to as the &quot;abandoned Applewhite Reservoir.&quot;</p>

<p>A decade later, part of that land has been transferred from SAWS to the city of San Antonio, and now makes up the <a href="http://www.sanantonio.gov/sapar/medinariveropen.asp?res=1024&amp;ver=true">Medina River Park</a>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>What is this new organization that is pushing a 
<a href="../../yet_more_antilo.html">bill</a> 
in the legislature that would <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared/tx/legislature/stories/04/8takings.html">restrict</a> Texas communities' 
ability to regulate development and protect water quality?&nbsp; They certainly appear to be well-connected, as they already have the GOP Texas Agricultural Commissioner, Susan Combs, and at least one state representative from each party introducing this legislation for them.</p>

<p>
They call themselves the &quot;Texas Landowners Conservancy.&quot;&nbsp; 
The name is a clear effort to associate themselves in the public's mind 
with well-regarded, non-political conservation groups such as the 
<a href="http://nature.org/">Nature Conservancy</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.hillcountryconservancy.org/why.php">Hill Country Conservancy</a>—groups
that buy up land and conservation easements in order to preserve as much undeveloped land,
and the plant and wildlife it contains, as possible.&nbsp; 
The intended association extends to the appearance of the Landowners Conservancy website, 
which is dominated by shades of green and brown and contains many images of majestic oak 
trees so typical of rural central Texas landscapes. 
</p>

<p>Yet, in contrast to those images, the Landowners Conservancy 
is fighting for their alleged right to pave over at least 45% of undeveloped land, irrespective of any negative affect this would have on surrounding communities' water quality.
</p>

<p>
In their April 5 <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050405/datu033.html?.v=6">press release</a>, 
the Landowners Conservancy describe themselves as 
&quot;a group of ranchers, land stewards and homeowners.&quot;&nbsp; 
On their <a href="http://texaslandowners.sitestreet.com/3/About_Us.html">website</a>, 
they go further, saying that they work to &quot;enhance the environment,&quot;
are &quot;deeply committed to the environment,&quot; and 
&quot;support legitimate environmental protection measures.&quot;&nbsp; Only after all that do
they mention that&nbsp; 
&quot;[we] are invoking a Constitutional stance that any governmental takings 
should fairly compensate landowners for their property.&quot;&nbsp; This is 
precisely the <a href="../../yet_more_antilo.html">agenda</a> of the long-standing &quot;takings&quot; movement that aims 
to prevent regulation of destructive land practices by making such 
regulation prohibitively expensive.
</p>

<p>
So who are these people exactly?&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>
Take Ted Stewart, the first member listed on the Landowners Conservancy '<a href="http://www.texaslandownersconservancy.org/3/About_Us.html">About Us</a>' page:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Ted Stewart</strong><strong> -</strong> Ted and his wife, Suzanne, relocated to
Austin from Odessa 13 years ago to live in the Texas Hill country. Ted
has spent more than a decade to revitalize his once overgrazed property
and improve water flow through cedar eradication, clearing nearly 3,000
acres. He has raised cattle with minimal impact on property and is
currently converting a portion of his ranch into a wildlife area. He
holds a BA degree in Chemistry from the University of Alabama.</em></p>
<p><em>Ted is an active participant in the &quot;Southwest Travis County Growth
Dialogue Process&quot; charged with creating a blueprint for future land
uses in western Travis County. Ted serves on the advisory boards of the
Ronald McDonald House and the Capital Area Boy Scouts. He and Suzanne
have four children and five grandchildren. </em> </p></blockquote><p>All well and good, but for some reason his occupation is not described.&nbsp; Not even alluded to.&nbsp; Some Google searching reveals the existence of a 
Ted Stewart involved with zoning changes in the village of 
<a href="http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:c-1OqMQbkrAJ:www.ci.bee-cave.tx.us/anm/minutes101299.htm+%22ted+Stewart%22+%22Bee+Cave%22&amp;hl=en">Bee Cave</a>, 
which is in western Travis County, in 1999:
</p><blockquote><p><em>Roger Pearson, a resident of Lake Pointe and a representative for Citizens for a Livable Bee Cave, 
came before the Board. He remarked that Mr. Stewart 's Juniper Trace project is a good neighbor to 
Lake Pointe. But he is concerned about the issues that come with a multi-family project with an 
85% impervious cover.
</em></p></blockquote><p>

From this and other sources, I get the impression that Mr. Stewart of western Travis County, 
is heavily involved in the real estate development business.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>Further evidence comes from the January 1, 1999 edition of the 
<a href="http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/1999/01/04/focus4.html">Austin Business Journal</a>
(emphasis added):
</p><blockquote><p><em>
If plans set into motion by Key Enterprises bear fruit, 
Austinites may have the opportunity to purchase $150,000 to $200,000 homes near Lakeway.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The company, which specializes in both pipeline construction and real estate, 
is the purchaser of 120.775 acres at General Williamson and Highland drives. 
<strong>Owner Ted Stewart already has a deal in the works to sell the land to a 
Dallas real estate developer.</strong>
</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>&quot;My investment strategy is to buy raw land, and do some preliminary planning,&quot; Stewart says. 
&quot;We identify a market and sell to a developer.&quot;</strong>
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Stewart says the area is saturated with high-priced estate lots and is ripe for 
one- to one-and-three-quarter-acre lots at a cost of around $60,000 each. 
Even before the land purchase was made, he aimed to set up this type of development.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;We worked backwards,&quot; he says. &quot;We started off to develop $150,000 to $200,000 homes. 
We conducted a feasibility study, located this land and purchased it. 
As part of our deal [with the developer], we guarantee that streets, 
water lines and utilities can be installed within the budget that we have proposed. 
<strong>That's our core business, offering a turnkey package -- land with the improvements in place.&quot;</strong>
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The development deal is not yet inked much less dried, but Stewart 
does not anticipate a problem.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;There are people standing in line to buy $60,000 lots,&quot; he says. 
&quot;That area out there has the need for nice, single-family lots, and this 
land is accessible to both lakes and several golf courses. It's right near the bridge, 
halfway between Bee Cave and Round Rock.&quot; 
</em></p></blockquote><p>

Is this really the same Ted Stewart involved with the Landowners' Conservancy.&nbsp; After all,
it's probably not that uncommon a name.&nbsp; What are the odds?
</p>

<p>Virtually 100%, I'd say.&nbsp; The giveaway is the 
<a href="http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/agenda/2005/zap_021505.htm">minutes</a> 
of the City of Austin
Zoning and Platting Commission meeting of Februrary 15, 2005.&nbsp; See item #28:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
28. Final Plat: C8-04-0164.1A - Cypress Bay-Lake Austin Final
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Location: N. Capital of Texas Hwy. At FM 2222 Rd., Bull Creek / Lake Austin Watershed
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Owner/Applicant: Key Enterprises, Inc. (Ted L. Stewart) (Ron Amini)
</em></p></blockquote><p>

Ron Amini is the third member of the Executive Committee listed on
the website of the Texas Landowners Conservancy.&nbsp; His apparent business 
connection with Key Enterprises and Ted Stewart is <a href="http://www.texaslandownersconservancy.org/3/About_Us.html">not mentioned</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Ron Amini -</strong> As a University of Texas alumni in
Petroleum Engineering, Ron returned to Austin in 1997 and purchased a
ranch on Cypress Creek.</em></p>

<p><em>He has implemented a Wildlife/Agricultural plan to include riparian
management and bird counts, providing habitat as well as supplemental
food for birds and other wildlife.&nbsp; He had participated in cedar
clearing programs and will work with officials to conduct prescribed
burns for the ranch, to help return it to its original state.&nbsp; </em></p>

<p><em>Ron was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, raised in Midland, Texas, and lived in San Antonio before moving to Austin.</em> </p></blockquote>

<p>
William Horabin, the fourth member of the Executive Committee, does
not appear to be a real-estate developer himself, but he does appear to have a history of 
<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2001/08/06/story6.html?jst=s_cn_hl">selling land</a> 
to real estate developers:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
William Horabin owns the land. However, it is under contract to Austin-based 
Land\Creek Development, a commercial division of Ash Creek Homes Inc.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Scott Taylor, project director at Land\Creek Development, says his company intends 
to develop five buildings with 12,000 square feet each. The estimated price tag 
for the project, called Park Bend Plaza, is $9 million.</em></p></blockquote><p>This, too, is not mentioned by the Landowners Conservancy:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>William C. Horabin -</strong> A lifetime outdoorsman, Bill
relishes life on his ranch where he raises quail for release into a
natural hill-country habitat.&nbsp; He has taken an over-grazed ranch and
restored natural grasses, eliminated erosion and provided natural
sources of water along with protein feed for wildlife.&nbsp; After clearing
250 acres of cedar from the property, he is especially pleased to find
the seeps and springs that have appeared as a result.&nbsp; His Western
Travis county ranch is a prime example of how land stewardship benefits
the environment.</em></p>

<p><em>Bill, a native of New Mexico and a graduate of the University of New
Mexico has lived in Austin for 26 years.&nbsp; He has held executive
positions in the financial services industry in New York, Oklahoma
City, Dallas and Austin, and in the long-term healthcare industry. 
Bill's community activities include work with the Austin Chamber of
Commerce and Seton Hospital,&nbsp; as well as promoting health-related
causes. Bill has three children.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, this is not a new tactic for special interests who suspect that their cause has little popular support:&nbsp; form an alleged &quot;grassroots&quot; group in an attempt to
deceive the general public.&nbsp; 
In this case, a group of real-estate developers have formed a group 
that gives a superficial appearance of being extremely interested in general environmental protection, while its true interests are personal and monetary.
</p>

<p>
If the Texas Landowners Conservancy does not intend to deceive, why do they not 
mention the real estate business interests of Stewart, Amini, and Horabin?
Why do they decorate their website with colors and 
pictures of natural landscapes when they desire to protect their so-called right to 
pave over at least 45% of the landscapes they own?
Why do they choose a name for their organization that echoes the names of
organizations with vastly different, even conflicting, goals?
</p>

<p>
Real estate developers are certainly justified in banding together just like any other
group of citizens.&nbsp; But pushing your interests via deception is a despicable and dishonorable practice.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Dem state Sen. Armbrister of Victoria 
may have a thing or two to learn from his colleagues
when trying to restrict local governments' ability to regulate development
that affects water quality.&nbsp; His bills, as I <a href="../../../03/texas_legislatu.html">wrote</a> <a href="../../edwards_aquifer.html">about</a> last week, outright prohibit cities from regulating the amount of impervious
cover or to do anything else to establish rules relating to water quality.
</p>

<p>

Some of his colleagues are taking a different, more subtle, 
<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA040605.15A.lege_land.1acb03f85.html">approach</a>:&nbsp; make 
cities pay developers not to pollute the water supply:
</p>

<p></p><blockquote><p><em>
Texas Agriculture Commissioner Susan Combs and state property rights advocates 
are pushing a new law that would require cities to pay landowners if environmental 
regulations harm their property values.
</em></p>

<p><em> 
...
</em></p>

<p><em>
It's a law that critics charge will gut the ability of cities like San Antonio 
and Austin to protect the Edwards Aquifer 
by making them pay property owners for limiting impervious cover—the 
percentage of a piece of property that can be paved or built out—to 
anything less than 45 percent.
</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;It looks like this bill would be devastating,&quot; said Brad Rockwell, deputy 
director of the Austin-based Save Our Springs Alliance. &quot;It in effect sets 
impervious cover at 45 percent. And science shows that anything above 10 or 15 percent 
impervious cover pollutes the aquifer.&quot; 
</em></p>

<p><em>
...
</em></p>

<p><em>
The legislation is sponsored by Rep. Robby Cook, D-Eagle Lake, and 
Sen. Todd Staples, R-Palestine, and supported by the Texas Landowners Conservancy.
</em></p>

<p><em>
The city of San Antonio currently sets impervious cover limits at 30 percent 
for residential development, but groups like the Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance 
are calling for more stringent controls over the aquifer recharge zone. 
Annalisa Peace, the alliance's executive director, said the proposed bills 
would make that economically impossible.
</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;If these two bills are passed, it pretty much takes away the municipalities' 
ability to protect the water supply,&quot; she said.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Attorney Dan Wheelus, who is representing the Texas Landowners Conservancy, 
disagrees, saying the legislation protects property owners while leaving cities 
the ability to impose whatever rules they think necessary—at a price.</em> 
</p></blockquote><p>

This is actually an old approach of the extreme &quot;property rights&quot; advocates—who 
are very hard to distinguish from large corporate interests, such as mining
companies and real estate developers.&nbsp; And if Bush and the GOP get their way 
in stacking the courts with extreme conservative ideologues, this will become standard practice for attempts by governments—local, state, and federal—to 
regulate land use all over the country. 

</p>

<p>In early 1995, when the Gingrichites had just taken over Congress and were
attempting to legislate such so-called &quot;takings&quot; policies, 
the New York Times <a href="http://worldpolicy.org/globalrights/environment/property%20rights2.html">published</a> 
an op-ed by a real-estate developer
who eloquently wrote of his opposition to such policies:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
As a homeowner and real estate developer, 
I believe in landowners’ rights and in preserving property values.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>That is precisely why I am against the so-called property rights bill 
passed by the House this month and comparable ones proposed in the Senate 
and in state legislatures throughout the country.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The details of the bills vary, but they would all establish a general rule. 
Taxpayers must pay a landowner when a zoning rule, environmental law or other 
governmental regulation limits the value of the land.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>At first glance, that may seem fair, even attractive. But on closer inspection, 
it is clear that such supposedly pro-landowner legislation would hurt most homeowners.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Many of the bills under debate in state legislatures would require that 
taxpayers pay landowners affected by zoning laws. But zoning laws have a purpose; 
they are typically designed to prohibit incompatible uses in the same area—for example, 
landfills or shopping centers in residential districts. So while a few landowners might 
make less money because they aren’t allowed create a landfill, the property values 
of the rest of the neighborhood are protected.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Similarly, the House has already passed a so-called takings bill targeted at 
wetland, water and wildlife laws that would require taxpayers to pay owners for 
foregone profit. In the Senate, Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, has introduced 
a bill that would require payment to landowners affected by any environmental 
or safety standard, including Federal rules that require cleaning up of toxic 
sites, prevent strip mining from ruining landscapes, keep air and water clean 
and limit development in flood-prone areas.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Yes, these standards might limit the potential profit from some land or even 
prohibit development in some areas, which could lower the value of the property. 
But the rules raise or protect the value of surrounding homes.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The advocates of these laws seem to have ignored the cliche that the factors 
that most affect home values are location, location and location. 
An incinerator built close by or polluted water will immediately reduce home values 
in a neighborhood. Coastal protection and wetland laws protect property values by 
keeping communities attractive and by buffering floods and ocean storms. 
A band of wetlands along the coast invariably increases the value of homes behind it.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>So under the new anti-regulation agenda, homeowners’ property values are threatened. 
Also, the sheer cost of paying property owners for their claims and the specter of 
continual litigation would dramatically undermine our environmental and zoning laws.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The new takings bills assume that landowners have the right to do anything 
they want with their property regardless of the impact on others. 
But I rely on a contrary view: property owners have a right to be 
protected against abuses by others.
</em></p></blockquote><p>

of polluters at the expense of the rights of everyone else,

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a href="http://www.pinkdome.com/archives/2005/04/index.html#a000241">PinkDome</a> has posted an update, from a press release by the <a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/">Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance</a>, on Dem state Sen. Madla's and his GOP co-sponsors' attempt to <a href="../../../03/update_on_texas.html">override local regulation</a> in favor of the interests of real estate developers.&nbsp; It is not good, as the bill was apparently passed out of Madla's committee yesterday on short notice:</p><blockquote><p><em>TEXAS- The Intergovernmental Relations Committee scheduled a second
public hearing for Senate Bill 848 in response to opposition by
community groups and environmentalists. The hearing was set for
Wednesday April 6th in Senator Frank Madla’s Intergovernmental
Relations committee, but Monday Senator Madla changed his mind and
called for an immediate vote at his desk where the public was not able
to comment or witness the votes. </em></p>

<p><em>Senate Bill 848 is a developer’s dream bill that focuses on granting
more powers to developers and dispenses with the need for a permit
application or a project. In addition Senate Bill 848 would allow a
developer to freeze city regulations merely by getting a utility to
agree to provide water, waste water, or electricity to the property
which is regularly done without any consideration towards current
regulations.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>Senator Madla has stated he was disappointed in the bill and would like
to change the bill to make it reflect the needs of his constituents.
Currently State Representative Mike Villarreal has offered an amendment
that gives cities and local communities authority to protect their

<p>Why, if he was so disappointed, did he change the schedule, override a scheduled public hearing, and call for an immediate vote?&nbsp; Madla has a lot of explaining to do.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One of our not-so-great Senators from the 
great state of Texas, John Cornyn, has furthered Tom DeLay's recent 
<a href="http://www.santamariatimes.com/articles/2005/04/04/sections/opinion/040405a.txt">vague threats</a> 
against the federal judiciary by airing his 
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26236-2005Apr4.html">concerns</a> 
that federal judges inspire violence against themselves with their
&quot;political&quot; decisions:
</p><blockquote><p><em>In a Senate floor speech in which he sharply criticized a 
recent Supreme Court ruling on the death penalty, 
Cornyn (R-Tex.) -- a former Texas Supreme Court justice 
and member of the Judiciary Committee -- said Americans are 
growing increasingly frustrated by what he describes as activist 
jurists.

<br /><br />&quot;It causes a lot of people, including me, great distress to see judges 
use the authority that they have been given to make raw political or 
ideological decisions,&quot; he said. Sometimes, he said, &quot;the Supreme Court 
has taken on this role as a policymaker rather than an enforcer of political 
decisions made by elected representatives of the people.&quot;

<br /><br />Cornyn continued: &quot;I don't know if there is a cause-and-effect connection, 
but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this 
country. . . . And I wonder whether there may be some connection between the 
perception in some quarters, on some occasions, where judges are making 
political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds 
up and builds up and builds up to the point where some people engage in, 
engage in violence. Certainly without any justification, but a concern 
that I have.&quot;</em> </p></blockquote><p>

As 
<a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_04_03.php#005332">Josh Marshall</a> 
points out, Cornyn is a &quot;wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bush White House.&quot;&nbsp; These, and Tom DeLay's earlier threat, are obviously not off-the-cuff remarks.
They are part of a long-term, calculated effort on the part of the GOP
to delegitimize the federal judiciary in the eyes of their rabid partisans.

</p>

<p>This campaign is obviously now ramping up.&nbsp; The GOP and the Bush administration 
used the (sure-loser) Schiavo case to bring the judicial issue back into the limelight, 
and now they are ramping up the anti-judge rhetoric.&nbsp; No doubt the ultimate 
goal is to make sure their base is completely up-in-arms when the time comes
for the Senate GOP to push through Bush's extremist judicial nominations
or the &quot;nuclear option&quot; of eliminating the traditional filibuster rules.
The result would be an prolonged era of conservative judicial activism, with courts
striking down, or severely curtailing, much of the popular, 
progressive legislation that has been enacted over the last seventy years—
legislation that the congressional GOP is too politically craven to revoke directly.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But why, if the GOP intends to advance their own judicial activism, are
they engaged in a war of words against federal judges?&nbsp; I belive it's
because that's all it is—a mere war of words.&nbsp; If they truly intended
to reduce the power of the judicial branch, Congress, from what I've read, has much more direct and
powerful means to do so, such as defunding courts and even impeaching judges.</p>

<p>Marshall Wittman at <a href="http://www.bullmooseblog.com/">Bull Moose</a>,
who I have much respect for, suggests that 
&quot;Democrats must renew their democratic spirit.&quot;&nbsp; On the contrary, 
the Democratic Party's stand against the stacking of the courts with conservative
extremists is a fight for the democratic spirit of the country.</p>

<p>Beyond the issue of the judiciary, it is sad, depressing, and 
downright dangerous that inhumane rhetoric like Cornyn's and Delay's 
is now an acceptable tactic on the part of leaders in the Republican party.&nbsp; 
To make sure that it doesn't remain an acceptable tactic, 
we need to turn their words against them, 
and make sure that the sensible majority in this country 
realize what people like Cornyn and DeLay and others in the GOP are saying.&nbsp; 
We cannot afford to allow these words to only get out to
the right-wing base for whom they are aimed and to the progressive activists
who are already aware.

</p>

<p>My local paper, the 
<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/">San Antonio Express-News</a>, 
does not appear to have any mention of Cornyn's statements today 
(at least in the online edition).&nbsp; 
The first small steps, on my part, are to write them and ask them to cover
this issue, and to ask for others to do the same for their own local media outlets.</p>
