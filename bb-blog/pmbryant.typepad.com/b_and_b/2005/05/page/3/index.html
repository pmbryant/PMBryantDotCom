		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Charles Kuffner at <a href="http://offthekuff.com/mt/">Off the Kuff</a> has an <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/005434.html#005434">interview</a> with Nick Lampson, who is running for the opportunity to take out Tom DeLay in 2006.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Lampson was a Democratic congressman from a neighboring Houston-area district until recently, when the DeLay led re-redistricting effort a couple years ago caused him to lose his re-election campaign in 2004.&nbsp; The district he represented included the Clear Lake and Johnson Space Center area, where I have lived briefly in the past, so I have occasionally followed his career since he was first elected to Congress in 1996, taking out a one-term Republican extremist who had been elected with the Gingrichites in 1994.</p>

<p>It turns out that DeLay's redrawn district includes a sizeable portion of Lampson's old district (including Clear Lake and JSC, I believe), so now Lampson will move a short distance down the road and take on his nemesis, whose years of corruption may finally be catching up to him.</p>

<p>Kuffner has written extensively about this district, CD 22.&nbsp; For those who haven't followed it as closely and want to fully understand the interview, Quan is Gordon Quan, who is a Houston city council member also thinking about running for the Democratic nomination in CD 22.&nbsp; Morrison is Richard Morrison, the Democrat who ran against Tom DeLay last time around.&nbsp; Despite lack of much institutional support, he came within around 10 percentage points of beating the Bug Man.&nbsp; (Prior to the election, I posted about that race <a href="../../../../2004/10/delay_could_be_.html">a</a> <a href="../../../../2004/10/defeat_tom_dela.html">few</a> <a href="../../../../2004/10/im_serious_dela.html">times</a>.)&nbsp; DeLay was actually forced to spend a significant amount of money and time campaigning.&nbsp; Morrison initially considered taking another shot at DeLay in 2006, but personal reasons have compelled him to drop out.</p>

<p>DeLay was in ethical hot water at the time of the last election, of course, but the public profile of his problems has intensified greatly in the last six months.&nbsp; With Morrison's strong performance last November in a less favorable environment, Dems are optimistic about their chances in this district in 2006.</p>

<p>A sample of Kuffner's interview with <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/005434.html#005434">Lampson</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Could you please elaborate on the Quan/Morrison meeting and the DCCC involvement in the race?</strong></em></p>

<p><em>I had an excellent meeting with Richard and Gordon, both of whom are
fine men. Nothing was conclusively resolved that day, but as you know
Richard decided not to make the race. I believe Gordon is still
weighing his options, though I've not talked to him recently. I do
believe I'm the strongest candidate to make this race.</em></p>

<p><em>Obviously, the DCCC is very interested in this race. It's hard to
tell at this early date what the extent of their involvement will be,
but I do expect them to be involved.</em></p>

<p><em><br /><strong>Obviously, Tom DeLay and his ethical woes have been very much
in the news lately. How will that affect your strategy and your message
in this race? How do you plan to convince suburban/exurban conservative
voters that you are not just another Democrat?</strong></em>
</p>

<p><em>My answer here might surprise you. I actually don't plan to make Tom
Delay the focus of this race. Let's face it, his name is in the paper
an awful lot these days - folks can make up their own minds there. My
plan is to concentrate on introducing myself - my common sense values,
my history of consensus-building - to the people of District 22. I've
gotten a lot of independent and crossover Republican support in the
past, and I believe I can do it again. I think people are tired of
controversy and bitter partisanship. I think they feel left out of the
discussion when they hear about all this stuff going on in Washington.
They're going about their daily lives - working hard, raising their
kids - and I believe they want their representatives in government who
roll up their sleeves and go to work for them every day, just like they
do. I've done that in all my previous public service, and will do it
again for District 22.</em></p></blockquote><p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Kimberly at <a href="http://www.alittlepollyanna.com/archives/2005/05/kuff_talks_to_n.php">A Little Polyanna</a> doesn't like Lampson's rhetoric in this interview, where he suggests that he would prefer to focus the campaign on his own qualifications rather than on the corruption of Tom DeLay.&nbsp; She thinks it shows he may not have the stomach for this fight.&nbsp; I disagree.&nbsp; I think it is standard politics.&nbsp; The candidate him- or herself is not the proper vehicle for negative politics.&nbsp; Especially since the public is already aware of the issues with DeLay, as appears to be the case now.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Remember that this is still a Republican-dominated district, so Lampson needs to sell himself to a sizeable number of Republicans as an acceptable alternative.&nbsp; If Lampson concentrated on attacking the Republican candidate, he would risk switching on these voters' instinctive partisan reflex to defend their own.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; This post has been plagued by typos, even in the title.&nbsp; I hope I've fixed them all by now.</p>

<p>UPDATE #3:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/4179.html">Carpetbagger Report</a> has an informative post up about this congressional district today.&nbsp; Apparently it is rapidly becoming a so-called &quot;majority-minority&quot; district, with very significant black, Latino, and Asian populations.</p>

		<a href="../../charismatic_spe.html">Species charisma:  problem or opportunity?</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Chris Mooney, a journalist who writes about science and politics for various national magazines, including The American Prospect and Mother Jones, is normally a very compelling&nbsp; and thorough writer.&nbsp; That is why I've enjoyed reading his articles and his blog, <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp">The Intersection</a>, for quite a while.&nbsp; For instance, he was the first member of the press that I know of to understand and expose the Bushies' and their allies' consistent, misleading uses of the phrases &quot;sound science&quot; and &quot;junk science.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, his new <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=9656">article</a> about the re-discovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker is less than convincing.&nbsp; The thesis is that we don't deserve to feel good about this remarkable event because some species are still extinct, some are endangered, and the Interior deparment is run by scoundrels.&nbsp; Certainly all these latter things are true and widely understood, but Mooney does not make the case for the connection with how we should feel about the ivory-billed woodpecker finding, and thus instead gives the impression of being a party-pooper.</p>

<p>Mooney tries to argue that the fact that some endangered species get more public attention than others is a problem.&nbsp; He even gives it a name:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><em><span class="summary">The charisma problem -- the fact that humans
arbitrarily value some creatures over others -- permeates attempts to
rehabilitate endangered species in the United States. It fueled the
dedication with which we fought to protect the spotted owl (a zeal
hardly to be detected in defense of the slick spot peppergrass). It
explains why we pat ourselves on the back so much to see populations of
bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and brown pelicans rebounding.
Meanwhile, a species that by all accounts ought to be deemed more than
heroic enough to save -- the Florida panther, of which less than a
hundred are left in the wild -- has been continually threatened by
encroaching development and lax regulations based on poor data.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>In this argument, Mooney misses the point behind the fight over the spotted owl back in the early 1990s.&nbsp; The passion in that battle was not for the owl; it was for its rapidly-shrinking habitat—old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; The owl was and is an indicator species, representing the health of its entire ecosystem.&nbsp; In this example, the owl's charisma was the antithesis of a problem; instead, it was an opportunity to be taken advantage of to help save many more species.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The difficulties of the Florida panther also fail to demonstrate that there is a charisma problem.&nbsp; Certainly if any animal is charismatic, a panther is.&nbsp; And the recovering populations of bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and brown pelicans hardly indicate any problem.&nbsp; Especially since without the charisma of creatures like these, there would be no Endangered Species Act at all, and where would that leave the slick spot peppergrass?&nbsp; So again, the charisma of certain species appears to be more of an opportunity than a problem.</p>

<p>In the midst of this unconvincing argument, Mooney uses imagery designed to
equate enthusiasm about birds and about nature in general with a
religious belief.&nbsp; This is a frame used frequently in recent years by
the right-wing to denigrate
environmentalists as &quot;nature worshippers,&quot; and hence as not like &quot;ordinary people.&quot;&nbsp; So it is surprising to
find Mooney propagating it.&nbsp; He calls the finding of the ivory-bill a
&quot;revelation,&quot; equates the bird to &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; and calls birding
field guides &quot;the Bible&quot; and &quot;Scripture.&quot;&nbsp; He also labels attempts to save the bird's
remaining habitat as &quot;charismatic creature worship.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mooney is clearly not purposefully
passing pejorative right-wing frames, since he is an avid birder himself.&nbsp; Yet his attempt to be clever not
only fails, it grates.</p>

<p>Despite my criticism of this short essay, I highly value much of Mooney's other work, and so don't want to end this post negatively.&nbsp; For a much better, more typical example of his work, see the article &quot;<a href="http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/6/mooney-science.asp">Blinded By Science</a>:&nbsp; How 'Balanced' Coverage Lets the Scientific Fringe Hijack Reality&quot; in the Columbia Journalism Review.&nbsp; Or see &quot;<a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=9556">A Cherry-Picking Accident</a>: Senator Inhofe should be more careful in deciding which scientific reports to misrepresent&quot; in the American Prospect.</p>

<p>UPDATE (5/12):&nbsp; Part of this post inspired a <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp?Id=1810">question</a> from Chris Mooney yesterday about literary sensibility.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="../../../04/yet_more_antilo.html">Taxpayer Extortion Act</a> was &quot;tentatively&quot; passed by the Texas House yesterday.&nbsp; (I don't yet understand all the intricacies of the Texas legislative process, &quot;second readings,&quot; etc., but here's some more <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/capitol/legproc/flract.htm">information</a> on that for anyone who cares to know.)&nbsp; Matt, at <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/">Just Another Blog</a>, who unfortunately uses the drab &quot;takings&quot; label favored by the real estate developers, has the <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/05/takings-bill-gets-through-2nd-reading.html">details</a> on how central Texas representatives voted.&nbsp; A clear partisan divide is evident.</p>



<p>The San Antonio Express-News has a brief, ridiculously biased <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/stategov/stories/MYSA051005.07A.lege_briefs.25bb9c364.html">account</a>—calling this a &quot;property protection bill,&quot; providing quotes from the bill's sponsor, and failing to include the numerous arguments on the side of the taxpayers and the general public.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the T.E.A. can still be stopped in the state Senate, where it is formally known as <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/cgi-bin/db2www/tlo/billhist/actions.d2w/report?LEG=79&amp;SESS=R&amp;CHAMBER=S&amp;BILLTYPE=B&amp;BILLSUFFIX=01647">SB 1647</a>.</p>

<p>So please tell your <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/fyi/fyi.htm">state Senator</a> that Texas taxpayers will not tolerate the idea of paying off real estate developers to not pollute our aquifers.</p>

		<a href="../../texas_landowner.html">Texas Landowners Conservancy unveiled in the Austin newspaper</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The Austin American-Statesman has a story on the deceptive group calling themselves the <a href="../../../04/what_is_the_tex.html">Texas Landowners Conservancy</a>.&nbsp; Of course, this is old news to regular readers of this site, as we wrote a similar account over a month ago, on <a href="../../../04/what_is_the_tex.html">April 8</a>.&nbsp; Among the revelations in this new story is that lawyers for this group actually wrote the <a href="../../../04/extortion.html">Taxpayer Extortion Act</a>, HB 2833 and SB 1647.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared/tx/legislature/stories/05/9takings.html">American-Statesman</a> account begins:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Start with the name: the Texas Landowners Conservancy.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>It evokes environmental groups, such as the Nature Conservancy and the Hill Country Conservancy, conjuring backgrounds as green and landscapes as lush as those on the LandownersConservancy's Web site.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Yet the group has created more ire and trepidation among Central Texas environmentalists, and some government officials, than any developer in a decade. In just three months of existence, the Landowners Conservancy has shown that is has deep pockets, powerful political connections and strong ties to developers, some of whom stand to reap bigger profits if the group can convince lawmakers that cities should compensate landowners for strict environmental regulations.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The group's founders develop land or own real estate companies. Yet they reject comparisons to better-known developers who repeatedly persuaded lawmakers to undermine Austin environmental regulations, particularly through the mid-1990s. Landowners Conservancy members say they take good care of their land, but they need to protect their property values from environmentalists.</em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, this article gives way too much attention to the claims of real estate developer Ted Stewart and company to be &quot;environmentalists,&quot; and focuses very little on the deception of their rhetoric.&nbsp; In fact, it completely fails to note that the web site of this organization and its various press releases have not disclosed its founders' business interests in land development.</p>

<p>A couple head-spinning quotes from the article:</p><blockquote><p><span class="cxnshared">Ted Stewart, co-founder:&nbsp; </span><em><span class="cxnshared">&quot;We're environmentalists. Our issue is not about (damaging the environment) at all.&quot;</span></em></p></blockquote><p>That's right.&nbsp; It's all about money.&nbsp; Polluting water supplies is just a side effect.</p><blockquote><p><span class="cxnshared">Charlotte Warren, treasurer:&nbsp; </span><em><span class="cxnshared">&quot;We're pretty much novices at this deal.&nbsp; None of us
really knew what it would take to start from zero and try to have an
impact.&quot;</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Try to reconcile that statement with this fact from the American-Statesman article:</p><blockquote><p><em><span class="cxnshared">One [of the group's lobbyists], David
Sibley, once was chairman of the Senate Business and Commerce
Committee. Another, Nora Del Bosque, is the sister of a top aide to
House Speaker Tom Craddick.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Novices indeed.</p>

<em>Just 20 minutes west of San Antonio, Castroville was founded by French Alsatian colonists in the mid-1800s, when Texas was still a republic. Today, with 97 historic European-style homes, inns and churches, Castroville is both a national and state historic district, and we enjoy a thriving tourist trade. And it's a great place to work and raise a family.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Unfortunately, a bill in the Legislature could severely impact the things that make our town unique.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>If House Bill 2833, by Rep. Robby Cook, D-Eagle Lake, or its near-twin Senate Bill 1647, by Sen. Todd Staples, R-Palestine, passes and is signed into law, our town will be faced with large new administrative and legal costs and could be forced to make enormous cash payoffs to landowners who simply disagree with the land use rules we believe are necessary to preserve the unique character of Castroville.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Most Texas cities and towns have land use restrictions to preserve their safety and character. They protect historical districts and structures, and they protect property values in residential neighborhoods by specifying minimum lot sizes or requiring setbacks from the street and neighbors' homes. They limit impervious cover to ensure greenery or keep moderate rainstorms from turning into raging floods.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>In our town, as in many others, we restrict where less desirable businesses like landfills, junkyards and liquor stores locate.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>If HB 2833 or SB 1647 becomes law, local restrictions against such ventures could entitle a landowner to sizable compensation from our city's limited treasury. It could subject us to lawsuits by any property owner, even out-of-town speculators who don't like local rules.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Since we have a budget of just $7.1 million and only 41 town employees, we may simply have to repeal the regulations that have protected the unique character of our community.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Dozens of unique communities across the state would be similarly vulnerable: Anyone with a piece of property and an outrageously out-of-place business plan could demand compensation when a city says no. And he wouldn't have to prove any actual losses — only that the restriction prevents him from making more.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>...
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Local land use planning is not &quot;taking&quot; a person's property or freedom. These zoning and land use restrictions almost always end up raising the value of property in affected areas. These bills would make taxpayers pay compensation for setting rules that improve communities and increase property values.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Unless the citizens of Texas stop these bills, the unique character of towns like Castroville could be lost forever.</em></p></blockquote><p>The time to stop these bills is right now.&nbsp; Today.&nbsp; If you live in Texas, you know <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/fyi/fyi.htm">what to do</a>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It's nice to see pleasing <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/elections/results/#San Antonio">election results</a>.  On the surface, the San Antonio election yesterday went very much as I would have liked.  And I couldn't even vote, living a couple miles outside the city limits.</p>

<p>First and foremost, <a href="../../san_antonio_pro.html">Proposition 1</a> to renew a 1/8-cent sales tax to buy land to protect the aquifer <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA050805.18A.ELX_props1and2.251e0c3a7.html">passed</a> by more than 10%:  55.1% to 44.9%.  Proposition 2, to share the same 1/8-cent tax to buy land for linear parks, also passed, by a slightly smaller margin.  This is a sales tax I will be happy to continue paying, even though I could not vote on it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my least favorite mayoral candidate, Carroll Schubert, was <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA050805.1A.ELX_mayor.251e891f7.html">eliminated</a>.  Julian Castro and Phil Hardberger will face off in a runoff on June 7, and perhaps I will finally be able to decide which of those guys I prefer.  Alas, I still won't be able to vote.  Castro got 42%, to 30% for Hardberger, to 26% for Schubert.</p>

<p>Over in the small town of Helotes, just northwest of San Antonio, where a <a href="../../../03/helotes_heritag.html">dispute</a> over a prospective Wal-Mart supercenter at a scenic location has been simmering over the last few months, the Wal-Mart opponents ousted at least one pro-Wal-Mart member of the city council.  And perhaps all three that they were aiming for, though the margins in the latter two races are four votes and, for Helotes mayor, a single vote.  Yes, a single vote!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.org/">Helotes Heritage Association</a>, run by the Wal-Mart opponents, is already proclaiming victory on their website, though I suspect that may be premature.<br />
<blockquote><em>Despite the conflicts of interest, petitions, meetings, letters, phone calls, protests, sea of "STOP WAL-MART, SAVE HELOTES" signs and a car fleet of "SAVE SCENIC LOOP" bumper stickers, the Helotes City Administration ruled by pro-developer politicians Steve Hodges and Charles James tried to push ahead with Wal-Mart plans in defiance of citizens. </p>

<p>Voters yesterday rejected Steve Hodges and his allies, Jim Collier and Pat Wooten, to elect a slate of candidates who oppose the Wal-Mart and pro-developer policies. Initial talleys show Jon Allan was elected Mayor over Hodges by one vote, 640 to 639, in a record voter turnout. Linda Boyer-Ownes, who also opposes Wal-Mart, has been certified the victor over Jim Collier with 673 votes over Collier's 565. Stuart Birnbaum, another Wal-Mart protest leader, beat Pat Wooten 640 to 636.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Finally, San Antonio is a big city with over a million people.  So why did the lead candidate in the mayoral race get less than 48,000 votes?  Barely 100,000 people voted.  That strikes me as rather dismal turnout, by an absolute standard.  But of course, it's probably quite typical historically.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Here's the San Antonio Express-News report on the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA050805.19A.ELX_suburbsrdp.251cf5390.html">Helotes election results</a>.  Apparently Hodges is already breaking out charges of voter fraud and talking about questioning voters.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Earlier this week, I wrote about the priority shift at NASA that is causing problems for NASA's <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=16769">Earth science program</a>.&nbsp; Bush's inability to back up his professed vision of manned spaceflight to the Moon and Mars with real money is causing severe cutbacks and delays in scientific missions that would provide great societal benefits, such as the <a href="../../nasas_earthobse.html">Global Precipitation Measurement</a> (GPM) mission that I described in that earlier post.</p>

<p>Now, one manned spaceflight enthusiast, Robert Zimmerman, who happens to write a weekly <a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/upi/index.php?feed=Science&amp;article=UPI-1-20050505-00034500-bc-spacewatch-engineering.xml">column</a> for UPI entitled &quot;Space Watch,&quot; is trying to portray last week's critical report from an arm of the National Academy of Sciences as merely part of a &quot;turf war&quot; between scientists and engineers.</p><blockquote><p><em>The turf war between engineers and scientists over government funding
erupted again last week with the release of an interim National
Research Council report criticizing NASA for canceling or delaying a
number of space-based Earth science projects.</em></p></blockquote><p>A turf war between engineers and scientists?&nbsp; I'd never heard of such a thing.&nbsp; In fact, the entire concept sounds ludicrous to me.&nbsp; In space-based science projects such as the GPM mission, the Mars rovers, Cassini, and others, a huge amount of cutting-edge engineering is involved.&nbsp; The scientists know this; the engineers know this.&nbsp; They are partners.</p>

<p>The real dispute is not between engineers and scientists, but between those whose primary passion is for human space exploration, such as <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3cxxp/zimbib.htm">Zimmerman</a>, and those whose top priority is to learn more about the planet we live on and the universe we live in.&nbsp; The sad thing is that this fight is unnecessary.&nbsp; There is a strong overlap between the interests of these groups.&nbsp; But they are being set against each other by Bush's meagerly-funded mandate, the sad result of which will likely be the failure to achieve the goals of either group in the near future.&nbsp; We are already seeing the <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-04-11-space-debate_x.htm">beginnings</a> of the problems in the scientific arena.&nbsp; &nbsp;Under Bush's plan, the space shuttle and the space station will also be gone soon.&nbsp; At that point, the lack of sufficient funds may finally make it clear to the exploration
boosters that the hopes of the Moon-Mars initiative remain as far
distant as ever.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Of course, by then, Bush will be long out of office.&nbsp; It will be up to his successors to manage this country's finances better and perhaps to fully fund an ambitious human space program.&nbsp; If they do, Bush clearly hopes to get some of the credit, as John F. Kennedy posthumously was credited for the Apollo program.&nbsp; Yet Bush will deserve none.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bush plays Zimmerman and his cohorts for fools, gettting them to praise him as &quot;bold and visioinary,&quot; while attacking his critics as merely fighting a turf war.&nbsp; The real story is that Bush is presiding over a space agency that is unwilling to risk sending a shuttle mission to the Hubble Space Telescope in low-Earth orbit, even though it has been sending humans to low-Earth orbit for over forty-three years.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Whenever and however it happens, sending humans to the Moon and Mars will be far riskier than sending them to the Hubble.&nbsp; Bush's NASA apparently wouldn't have the nerve to do it, even if they had the money.&nbsp; Hopefully, his successors' NASA will have both the nerve and the money.&nbsp; And hopefully NASA's science program will not be decimated in the process.</p>

		<a href="../../just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon:  "a place to recharge the spirit as well as the aquifer"</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Just west of the expanding sprawl of San Antonio, straddling the Balcones fault that separates the rolling, mesquite-covered brushlands of the South Texas plains from the rugged, oak- and cedar-covered hills of the Edwards Plateau, lies a ranch along an old road to frontier forts—a road cut by the pre-civil war U.S. military back in the 1850s.&nbsp; The road travels through a canyon and next to a reliable spring, where once upon a time dusty travellers could stop to rest and refresh themselves.&nbsp; The area became known as Government Canyon, after the road builders.</p>

<p>Over the years, Texas and San Antonio boomed, and developers of various sorts set their eyes on this scenic land that overlies the recharge zone for the Edwards aquifer, San Antonio's primary water source.&nbsp; Some had plans to build hundreds or thousands of houses and a golf course or two.&nbsp; Then came the savings and loan collapse of the 1980s, and the land was <a href="http://www.asu.edu/caed/proceedings97/lima.html">foreclosed</a> on by the federal government's Resolution Trust Corporation, which planned to sell it at auction.&nbsp; Fortunately, some local visionaries did not let this opportunity slip away, as recounted in this <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol18/issue37/cols.daytrips.html">1999 article</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Using the Austin-based Trust for Public Lands as a broker, the coalition persuaded the Edwards Underground Water District [now the Edwards Aquifer Authority], San Antonio Water System (city-owned water supplier), and other grantors to put up $3 million of $3.5 million for the 6,000 acres. None of the participating entities wanted to be responsible for holding the land, so they turned to TPWD [Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]. Offering the state the property for $500,000 sounds like it should have been a very nice little deal, [Danielle] Milam [one of the local activists] says, but the first year was marked by disagreements between the first park manager and the environmentalists.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Until Deidre [Hisler] was appointed we had lots of little skirmishes,&quot; Milam says. &quot;She has a way of taking the most hardcore bubba and making them respect the place.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>The first 4,717 acres of the 6,643-acre [now <a href="http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=18458&amp;folder_id=264">8,622-acre</a>] nature preserve were purchased [in 1993].</em></p></blockquote><p>And so <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/govcan/">Government Canyon State Natural Area</a> was born.&nbsp; Twelve years later, it is finally on the verge of opening to the public.&nbsp; Alas, not quite as soon as we had <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA043005.3B.government.2282f8116.html">hoped</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>After years of saying that the 8,622-acre natural area might open the following year, the state agency [TPWD] committed earlier this year to unlock the gates on June 4, but it recently backed away from that date due to delays in constructing Government Canyon's visitor center, exhibit hall 
and education center.
</em><em><span class="vitstorybody"><br />
<p>
&quot;We had set that with some reservation,&quot; said Steve Whiston, director of 
the agency's infrastructure division. &quot;We realized about a week or so 
ago that given all that remained yet to do, it was just going to be 
impossible for us to get it open for this target date.&quot;
</p>
<p>
No new opening date has been set. &quot;We want to make sure we're actually 
going to hit it before we do,&quot; said Brent Leisure, regional state parks 
director.
</p>
<p>
The people who oversee Government Canyon are hopeful that the public 
will be able to visit it within a few months.
</p>
<p>
&quot;We plan to do everything in our power to have an opening in the 
summer,&quot; said Deirdre Hisler, the natural area's manager.
</p>
<p>
Brent Leisure, regional state parks director, said that Government 
Canyon will almost certainly open in 2005.
</p>
<p>
When it does open, Government Canyon will offer 40 miles of trails, 
multiple picnic areas and a single large pavilion equipped with a huge 
fireplace.
</p>
<p>
It also will offer San Antonio residents and others an immense, rugged 
and beautiful place to escape.
</p>
<p>
&quot;It's going to be a wonderful site that people do not forget once they 
see it,&quot; Leisure said. &quot;It's a wonderful example of a really unique 
system that is so close to a major population center.&quot;
</p></span></em></p></blockquote><p>Fortunately, while the park has not been open for general use, it has been possible to get access once in a while.&nbsp; For instance, for over three years now, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to volunteer to help build and maintain hiking and horse trails at the park.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And I've learned that, even though it likely will soon be completely surrounded by residential developments, Government Canyon truly is a spectacular place.&nbsp; Thanks to the <a href="http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=5305&amp;folder_id=1545">vision and hard work</a> of many over the years, with <a href="http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=10121&amp;folder_id=264">help</a> from the money generated by San Antonio voters and taxpayers who passed Proposition 3 in 2000 (which will hopefully be renewed as <a href="../../san_antonio_pro.html">Proposition 1</a> this year), a large enough area has been protected to really give a strong feel of nature, even so close to suburban sprawl.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For those who live in California or other areas with an abundance of National Parks and National Forests, 8,000-plus acres may not sound like much.&nbsp; But it is huge by (non-Big Bend) Texas standards.&nbsp; This did not come easy, and people here obviously care very deeply about this <a href="http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=5305&amp;folder_id=1545">place</a>. </p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;Members of the community really feel that this place belongs to
them, and they are very committed to helping us manage it,&quot; says
Deirdre Hisler, the enthusiastic whirlwind who oversees Government
Canyon State Natural Area for Texas Parks and Wildlife, talking with a
visitor on the tree-shaded porch of the old ranch house that serves as
park headquarters. &quot;We are trying to make this a model for a new,
cutting-edge kind of state park--one in which our partners and the
people who live in Bexar County are involved every step of the way.&quot; </em></p>

<p><em>...<br /> </em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><em>According to its master plan, the primary purpose of the state
natural area is to protect the canyon's natural resources. Human
activities will be limited to such low-impact pursuits as hiking,
picnicking, primitive camping, birding, and mountain biking. Eight
miles of equestrian trails are planned on the park's least sensitive
acreage. Although no construction will occur in the recharge area, an
eco-friendly visitor center, classroom, and a few other structures are
being built beyond that zone. </em></p>

<p><em>Meanwhile, scores of trained volunteers, along with laborers from
the Texas Department of Corrections, have been building a trail
network, removing non-native flora and fauna, restoring native
grasslands, and carrying out other tasks that must be completed before
the land will be opened to visitors. </em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>&quot;Our outreach emphasizes that there's more to do in parks than play
soccer or T-ball,&quot; says Hisler, noting that the ballfields some would
like to see at Government Canyon demand the use of chemicals that could
contaminate the aquifer. &quot;We're offering a more nature-oriented kind of
recreation,&quot; she says, citing Government Canyon's silence and solitude
as two of its greatest assets. Visiting high-stressed officials have
gone home relaxed and convinced that, as the park's manager puts it,
&quot;this is a place to recharge the spirit as well as the aquifer.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Many thanks to all those who made this park possible.&nbsp; We've waited patiently many years for it to open, so a few more weeks or months is no problem.&nbsp; It is here for the long haul, and that is what is important.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Matt at <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/05/reasons-to-vote-prop-1_03.html">Just Another Blog</a> has a post up on the top ten reasons to vote for San Antonio's Proposition 1 in the imminent municipal elections.  Prop 1 is the initiative to implement (continue, really) a 1/8-cent sales tax and to devote the money to purchase land for protection of the <a href="../../../04/edwards_aquifer.html">Edwards aquifer</a>.  A similar program was passed by San Antonio voters in 2000 and expires this year.</p>

<p>His first two reasons get right to the heart of the matter:<br />
<blockquote><em>1. The Edwards Aquifer is the primary source of drinking water for 1.7 million South-central Texans today, and will be for a million more citizens within 25 years.</p>

<p>2. If we fail to protect the aquifer and pollute our drinking water, we’ll have to build water-treatment plants that will cost billions of dollars. Talk about squandermania!</em></blockquote></p>

<p>A couple later reasons explain the rationale:<br />
<blockquote><em>7. New state law allows the city to acquire land both inside and outside of Bexar County, so we can now protect land to the west of the city, where 70 percent of the aquifer’s recharge takes place and where land is far more affordable. </p>

<p>8. Edwards Aquifer Authority studies show that when impervious cover exceeds 15 percent, water-quality problems emerge. Attaining that goal is more likely in rural lands to the west, where most of our water comes from.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>And land out west is cheaper, allowing us to spend the money more efficiently.  The 2000 initiative was initially supposed to acquire 10,000 acres, but only was able to acquire 6,500 due to dramatically rising land prices in Bexar County over the last few years.</p>

<p>San Antonio Express-News columnist Roddy Stinson has a similar <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/rstinson/stories/MYSA050105.3A.Stinson.22c4e44f7.html">list</a>, but from the opposite point of view:  "Top 10 reasons for opposing sales tax Propositions 1 and 2."  (Proposition 2 is another worthwhile initiative to increase the sales tax by 1/8-cent in order to acquire further  land for linear parks in the city.)  Stinson's list consists primarily of anti-local government rants and guilt-by-association-with-the-not-guilty.  </p>

<p>In particular:<blockquote><em>2. Taxpayers have not been told (a) what land, (b) whose properties or (c) how many acres will be bought with the $90 million authorized for collection by Proposition 1.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>So he claims it is a major problem that the San Antonio government hasn't already mapped out exactly which land they will purchase.  That sounds like a brilliant negotiating tactic, doesn't it?  And no doubt if they had, Stinson would be railing against government waste&#151planning to spend money they may never have.<br />
<blockquote><em>6. At some point, taxpayers have to say, "Enough." </p>

<p>If the state Legislature raises the sales tax from 6.25 percent to 7.25 percent and city voters approve Propositions 1 and 2, raising the local sales tax to 17/8 percent, San Antonians will be perpetually burdened by a sales tax of 91/8 percent!<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Note that first "if."  The state House, run by the GOP, is proposing to raise sales taxes by a full cent.  That is far larger than the increase for both Propositions 1 and 2 combined.  Where are Stinson's rants against the state legislature?  Also note the gratuitous, false, insertion of the word "perpetually."</p>

<p>As if that is not bad enough, he concludes with this:<br />
<blockquote><em>7. According to information on the Web site of the Aquifer Protection Initiative, Proposition 1's backers include the Alamo Chapter of the Sierra Club ... </p>

<p>8. Texas Environmental Democrats ... </p>

<p>9. Esperanza Peace and Justice Center ... </p>

<p>10. La Tuna Icehouse. </p>

<p>I rest my case.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Perhaps we can take advantage of Stinson's knee-jerk reactions whenever the Sierra Club is mentioned (I've noticed the phrase "Sierra Club wackos" commonly shows up in his writings.  It's kind of cute, in a weird way, given how marginal the Sierra Club is here in Texas.)  Next time, perhaps the Club should issue a press release directly to Stinson claiming to be on the opposite side of an issue than they really are.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to Matt for coming up with an excellent response to Stinson.</p>
