                                <p>The troubled budgetary situation of Texas' state park system that I've written about <a href="../../../2005/12/texas_state_par.html">earlier</a> received some more press last weekend.  Both the <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8FD6SOG3.html">Dallas Morning-News</a> and the <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/3619036.html">Houston Chronicle</a>, along with at least a few other smaller newspapers, ran an AP article on the issue&#151an article that also discussed an organization that is attempting to rally the public to support the parks.<blockquote><em>For as long as she can remember, Beth McDonald has been a frequent visitor of Texas' state parks. Whether for camping, picnics or afternoon fishing trips, it was easy to load the family into the truck for an outdoor adventure. </p>

<p>"We practically raised our kids at Bastrop State Park," she said. </p>

<p>That's why an ongoing budget battle at the state Capitol, depleted funding and deteriorating conditions at Texas parks have her so upset. </p>

<p>Budget constraints have forced the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to cut hours and staff at state parks and limit maintenance. The changes have park enthusiasts hopping mad and calling on voters to make boosting funding an election issue. </p>

<p>"There is a firestorm igniting that will be in full force by election time," said McDonald, 79, a retired medical assistant and hospital administrator who now serves as the president of the non-profit Texans for State Parks group. </p>

<p>The group was meeting Friday and Saturday at Bastrop State Park to drum up support for its cause. The meeting should draw hundreds of supporters, McDonald said. </p>

<p>Formed in 1997, Texans for State Parks has about 150 members and another 35 affiliated parks groups around the state. </p>

<p>"We are not going to sit down idly by and watch our once beautiful parks go down the drain," McDonald said.</em></blockquote><a href="http://www.texansforstateparks.org/default.asp">Texans for State Parks</a>.  The organization has been around a few years, but their web site looks brand spanking new.  Check them out&#151;and consider helping to stoke the "firestorm" save our parks.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Over the weekend, the San Antonio Express-News published a revealing <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA012206.01A.Schaefer_Lawsuits.356ac02.html">article</a> about how the governmental system in Texas is rigged vastly in the favor of real-estate developers over the needs and desires of the communities of our state.</p>

<p>In short, no matter what laws a community may pass to attempt to regulate and control how it develops for the benefit of its citizens, real estate developers can do whatever they please.  All thanks to what a legal concept so unobtrusively called "vested rights."</p>

<p>The scenario from Sunday's article is sadly typical, as revealed in a <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA101605.1A.vested.main.3d67547.html">four-part</a> Express-News report from last October.  (1) City wants developer to abide by laws passed roughly a decade ago that require developer to be a good neighbor.  (2) Developer objects to obeying current laws and waves around vague 30-year old documents from a previous owner of the land describing a completely different project, claiming that these ancient forms exempt the developer from current law.  (3) A governmental entity, beaurocrat or judge, approves the developer's objection thanks to the Texas state law concept of "vested rights."    (4) Land development proceeds, making oodles of money for the developer at the expense of the citizens of the community whose laws he has just flouted.  </p>

<p>In the specific case reported on Sunday, the developer is John Schaefer and the city is San Antonio.<blockquote><em>The 27 acres of plowed earth that Schaefer and city lawyers are skirmishing over lies on the rapidly growing Northeast Side. </p>

<p>Bernard said the city asked Schaefer's engineer to prove that plans for the dense, 150-home development on Crestway Road wouldn't dramatically increase storm-water runoff flowing to a dam on Martinez Creek. </p>

<p>But Schaefer felt the property was already designed to handle the runoff and didn't want to follow the city's 1997 drainage ordinance. <br />
The rules require developers to either pay fees earmarked for flood-control projects, or set aside valuable land for basins that impede runoff. </p>

<p>Schaefer said he didn't have to follow those requirements because of a 1971 planning document known as a plat that had been filed by a previous landowner. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The 1971 plat in Schaefer's possession only showed the contours of the property, giving no indication of what was supposed to be built. </p>

<p>Schaefer and his engineer said that didn't matter. </p>

<p>"They've got a plat," said engineer Harry Jewett during a civil deposition. "They can do anything under that, whether it would have been a mobile home park or a subdivision of single-family residences or a skating rink or a shopping mall or whatever."</em></blockquote>The result?<blockquote><em>In the end, [district court Judge Andy] Mireles granted Schaefer nearly every item on his wish list, including exemptions from the city's drainage rules. </p>

<p>The decision meant Schaefer could use his vague plan, and he was also exempted from ordinances covering safety standards for issues such as street construction.</em></blockquote>Until recently, San Antonio bureaucrats appear to have been complicit in this undermining of their own laws.  But that has been changing as more and more citizens become concerned with runaway growth:<blockquote><em>With the hiring of City Attorney Andrew Martin in 2002, San Antonio officials began challenging more grandfathering claims, although most still are approved. The development industry has turned to an old friend, the Texas Legislature, to seek a remedy.</p>

<p>In the past five years, members of the real estate industry who have publicly supported the vested rights law paid more than $4 million in campaign contributions to Texas lawmakers and spent at least $11.7 million in lobbying fees.</p>

<p>During that time, legislators filed several bills that broadened the type of plans that could trigger exemptions.</em></blockquote>So who are the real estate developers' friends in the state capitol that created, and seek to continue, this environment so hostile to local communities?</p>

<p>As those monetary figures above should indicate, there are plenty.  And at the top, the list includes the current Governor of Texas, Rick "Goodhair" Perry himself.  From the Express-News' October <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA101805.01A.VestedPolitics.de2a462.html">investigation</a>:<blockquote><em>When San Antonio's top developers threw a fundraiser last year [2004] for Texas Gov. Rick Perry, architect Steve Heflin [then President of the Greater San Antonio Builders Association] assured colleagues the poolside gala would pay off.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"All of you who participated and contributed — Gov. Perry thanks you for it," Heflin wrote. "Next year when we are campaigning for vested rights legislation, we know we have a friend at our state capitol."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Perry, who received nearly $400,000 in the past five years from the [Texas real estate] industry, has signed three vested rights bills.</p>

<p>The legislation broadened the type of permits that trigger exemptions and whittled down the authority of cities to impose development controls.</em></blockquote>To help get the government of this state out of the hands of special interests, Governor Perry has got to go.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the seven years I have lived in Texas, this state has never been a big spender on public parks.  In a state with little in the way of national parks (aside from <a href="http://www.nps.gov/bibe/">Big Bend National Park</a> way out west, a full days' drive from the vast majority of Texas' citizens), this shortage of well-funded state parks is particularly acute.  The recent, long-delayed, <a href="../../../2005/10/feature_on_gove.html">opening</a> of so substantial a new park as Government Canyon State Natural Area, so near to a major metropolital area, was thus very welcome news.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some unwelcome news is also on the way, as was <a href="http://www.lufkindailynews.com/news/content/news/stories/2005/11/13/20051113LDNparks.html">reported</a> last month:<blockquote><em>As the state develops its land the need for green escapes increases. Texas, [Texas Parks and Wildlife commissioner John Parker] said, needs five new parks with 5,000 acres each. </p>

<p>Instead, Parker has watched the state's treasure tarnish with each legislative budget cut. </p>

<p>"The legislature, House and Senate, failed to adequately fund the state park system and told them they were going to cut our budget 5 percent on top of the 15 percent cut the 78th legislature cut it," Parker said.</p>

<p>When state park system's regional directors convened in Austin this past week [early November], Parker was told they were considering drastic cuts to the state park system in order to balance the 2006 budget based on what the legislature had appropriated it. Immediately at stake are the jobs of up to 109 full time state park employees and 100-plus seasonal employees, Parker said. The further reduced budget will also mean closing parks and historical sites a few days a week. </p>

<p>"These sites are located across the state where school children are taken on field trips to see, touch and feel Texas history with their own eyes," Parker said as he drove through Friday morning's early fog en route to Martin Dies Jr. State Park outside Jasper. "The message we are giving with this latest cut that this legislature has forced is 'kids, we as legislators don't think it is important for you to have full advantage of the state historical sites like Caddoan Mounds in Alto or Mission Tejas four miles west of Alto.'"</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"So now we are at the edge of the cliff because of lack of concern from the state legislature," Parker said. "We'll have to start laying off employees, closing parks, closing historical sites and reducing hours. I just don't think the people of Texas want that to happen." </p>

<p>"Have you seen Arkansas' state parks since they renovated them?" Parker asked on the ride home. This was done by increasing the state sales tax less than a penny, knowing the enhanced green spaces would attract economic development, companies which value places for their employees to decompress. "Their state parks are magnificent!"</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Texas' state parks, while too few and too small for our population, are also magnificent, in my limited experience.  Just in central Texas, we have, among others, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/lost_maples/">Lost Maples State Natural Area</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/garner/">Garner State Park</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/hill_country/">Hill Country State Natural Area</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/guadalupe_river/">Guadalupe River State Park</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/enchanted_rock/">Enchanted Rock State Natural Area</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/pedernales_falls/">Pedernales Falls State Park</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/palmetto/">Palmetto State Park</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/choke_canyon/">Choke Canyon State Park</a>.  And of course there are the showpieces I've written about before: just outside of San Antonio, <a href="../../../2005/05/just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon State Natural Area</a>, and out in the wilds of west Texas, <a href="../../../2005/12/the_saga_of_big.html">Big Bend Ranch State Park</a>.   </p>

<p>By underfunding our parks, locking them up several days a week and laying off staff, the Texas legislature is ensuring that fewer of the ever-increasing population of this state will be able to enjoy their magnificence.  Our quality of life will be diminished.  Certainly a great state such as Texas can do better.</p>

<p>Then again, there's a <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/3505049.html">lot of things</a> at which we should be doing better:<blockquote><em>AUSTIN - Texas is the only state in the nation that reduced education spending during the 2004-05 school year, according to a report released Monday by the National Education Association.</p>

<p>Per pupil expenditures fell by 1 percent from the previous year, and Texas dropped from 36th to 40th relative to other state's education investments.</em></blockquote>So are we a great state or not?</p>

                                <p>Looks like I'm going to have a difficult choice to make next spring in the Democratic primary for state senate.  State representative Carlos Uresti is <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA120105.01B.Senate_Race.12a903bf.html">challenging</a> my current state senator, Frank Madla.  Several other Texas and San Antonio bloggers have already written about this breaking news, including <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/006475.html#006475">Charles Kuffner</a>, <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2005/12/carlos_uresti_t.html">Eddie</a>, <a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com/2005/12/and-its-official.html">The Jeffersonian</a>, and <a href="http://www.inthepinktexas.com/index.php?p=757">In the Pink</a>.</p>

<p>While I've been critical of Senator Madla on this blog <a href="../../../2005/04/state_sen_madla.html">before</a>, voting to oust an incumbent Democratic legislator is not something I would do lightly.  So, while I have no reason at the moment not to think highly of Rep. Uresti, I'm going to have to do some extensive research and put some heavy thinking into this race over the next few months.  </p>

<p>I, of course, welcome any information and advice any fellow progressive wants to send along.</p>

                                <p>Seems the Texas businessman who angled to purchase a large section of <a href="../../../2005/08/big_bend_ranch_.html">Big Bend Ranch State Park</a> in west Texas earlier this year, only to be thwarted by a public outcry at the discovery of the secret negotiations and by an ensuing vote of the Texas Parks and Wildlife commissioners, has not given up.</p>

<p>Thanks to the magic of <a href="https://news.google.com">Google News</a>, I have discovered a <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/3424513.html">story</a> that I missed when it was reported by the Houston Chronicle a few weeks ago:<blockquote><em>Despite the controversy that erupted over his unsuccessful attempt in August to acquire 46,000 acres from the state park system, [Houston businessman John] Poindexter said last week he may revive his purchase offer after next year's GOP gubernatorial contest, which he claims had a role in dooming the initial deal.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The 46,000 acres that the state considered selling him wasn't being sought to expand his resort facilities, as some critics asserted, he added.</p>

<p>"The development potential — as was so frequently cited in the hearing — for this property is as close to zero as anything could reasonably be in the state," he said.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Poindexter said he appreciates the public's resistance to selling any parkland.</p>

<p>"An emotion like that is, to me, rational. I wouldn't sell a square foot of Cibolo Creek Ranch," he said.</em></blockquote>This Chronicle article is almost entirely about Poindexter and his proclaimed desire to rebuild his reputation and leave a positive legacy.  Is it sincere, or part of a <a href="http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?list=type&type=102">greenwash</a> PR-job in advance of his next attempt to purchase the public property?</p>

<p>The Austin American-Statesman followed up with a more complete <a href="http://www.statesman.com/metrostate/content/metro/stories/11/2bigbend.html">story</a> on November 2.  It goes into more detail about how the potential land deal developed behind-the-scenes:<blockquote><em>Contrary to the hurried nature of the final negotiations, Poindexter actually approached the department about buying part of the park more than four years ago. Then-Executive Director Andrew Sansom, citing the fragile and archaeologically significant aspects of the area, rejected the proposal, and the issue died until Poindexter contacted Fitzsimons this year, according to records acquired by the American-Statesman.</p>

<p>Fitzsimons said negotiations with Poindexter regarding a conservation easement he believed would have protected water and Native American sites within the 46,000 acres made the sale worth considering. Negotiations continued almost until the Aug. 25 meeting began. The easement would have placed severe restrictions on Poindexter in terms of water use and required protection of sensitive archaeological sites on the property. The easement also would have allowed Poindexter to develop about 4,600 acres — or 10 percent of the property — along Cienega Creek.</p>

<p>"The (4,600) acres that was being proposed was the worst, from our standpoint," said Lawerence Oaks, executive director of the Texas Historical Commission. "That was the area that was occupied (by native peoples) for 10,000 years."</em></blockquote> </p>

<p>The potential conservation easement, and what it did not cover, was reported back in August when this news first broke, but it is a useful reminder.  How do the exceptions to the easement jive with Poindexter's new claim about the "close to zero" development potential for this land?  </p>

<p>If so, why not put conservation easements on the whole thing?  4,600 acres is not a small plot of land&#151;if it were in central Texas, that would be one of our largest parks, all by itself.</p>

                                <p>As I suspected, once exposed to public scrutiny, the <a href="../../../2005/08/texas_to_sell_o.html">proposed sell-off</a> of a large portion of one of the Big Bend Ranch State Park, has been defeated.  The <a href="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/other/08/26bigbend.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> reports<blockquote><em>Texas Parks and Wildlife Department commissioners Thursday unanimously rejected a ranch owner's bid to buy more than 46,000 acres of Big Bend Ranch State Park in Presido County.</p>

<p>Park and wilderness activists, conservation group representatives and even former department employees opposed to the land sale broke into applause with the vote. The land under consideration which would have included archeological sites and creek habitat that is home to threatened and endangered animals.</p>

<p>The vote closed two contentious days of testimony about losing a part of the state's largest park and the lack of public knowledge of the proposal until the Austin American-Statesman disclosed the proposed sale this week.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Few people who testified before the commission Wednesday and Thursday agreed with the department's proposal to sell. Many criticized the lack of extensive public input on the state's divesting any portion of the park.</p>

<p>"The area in question contains 14 recorded pristine archeological sites, and at least 100 additional sites are known," said Larry Oaks, executive director of the Texas Historical Commission. "These sites range from prehistoric rock art to rock shelters and ruins of early historic settlements. There are remnants of Late Prehistoric Cielo Complex dwellings native only to this part of Texas."</p>

<p>Oaks said he was appalled by the lack of discussion of the sale before this week.</p>

<p>"It appears not only did you not consult us about this proposed sale, but (you also) didn't consult early with members of your own staff. . . . We are strongly opposed to the sale of any parcel of this pristine area before further study can be conducted."</p>

<p>[Houston businessman and prospective land-purchaser John] Poindexter had agreed to a state-mandated conservation easement on the 46,000 acres. The easement would have been designed to protect creekside habitat along Cienega Creek, the only creek at Big Bend Ranch that has fish. The creek originates on Cibolo Creek Ranch, Poindexter's adjacent resort.</p>

<p>However, the easement would have allowed development of 4,600 acres, including some of the highly prized land along and overlooking the creek. Park activists argued that the department was giving away too much of its control of the Cienega region of the ranch, especially the water, without accepting public input.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>One issue that kept cropping up was whether the department can protect water in Cienega Creek. Since the water that makes the creek originates on Poindexter's ranch, there is some question about whether he might capture the water there and reduce or even stop the flow into the park.</p>

<p>"It is mine to do with as I wish," Poindexter said. "It will be used sooner or later by myself or my successors."<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Is that last line a threat?  I would hope that water law in this state would not allow such behavior.  But water law can be very convoluted and primitive, so I can't say.</p>

<p>Thanks to all who helped defeat this proposal on such short notice.</p>

                                <p>For Texans who care about public lands and open government, this <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/metropolitan/3321867">story</a> is something to keep a very close eye on:<br />
<em><blockquote><strong>Texas may sell part of Big Bend Ranch State Park</strong><br />
Associated Press</p>

<p>AUSTIN - State park officials are considering selling one-sixth of the flagship Big Bend Ranch State Park, the Austin American-Statesman reported today. </p>

<p>Texas Parks and Wildlife commissioners are to discuss the sale of 45,000 acres of the 300,000-acre park in a closed session Wednesday in Austin. The first public discussion and a vote by the commission could come Thursday. </p>

<p>Houston businessman John Poindexter confirmed he has been negotiating with the Parks and Wildlife Department. Poindexter, who owns the exclusive resort Cibolo Creek Ranch adjacent to the park, had no further comment. </p>

<p>Word of the talks has drawn criticism from a former parks commissioner who decried the possible sale and from an environmental advocate who called the secret preparations for a sale bad public policy. </p>

<p>Parks and Wildlife Executive Director Bob Cook said Monday that selling the odd-shaped land that juts out from the rest of the park could help the department square up the park's boundaries and simplify management of the vast desert site in West Texas. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Former Parks and Wildlife commissioner Bob Armstrong, who worked to have the state acquire the Big Bend property and protect it as a park, views the proposal with skepticism. Armstrong also is a former state land commissioner and former legislator. </p>

<p>"To trade this off would be a shame," Armstrong said. </p>

<p>The area has a spring known as the Cienega, and that has value beyond any money the department might acquire, Armstrong said. </p>

<p>"That's a very special place," he said. </p>

<p>Armstrong said the stovepipe shape of the northwest corner of the ranch was laid out in order to preserve the springs and creeks that make up the area. </p>

<p>Ken Kramer of the Sierra Club said what bothers him most is the secrecy surrounding the possible sale. </p>

<p>"To have something like this happen without public discussion is bad public policy," he said. </p>

<p>[Parks and Wildlife Executive Director] Cook said the parks department wasn't trying to hide the sale, only to protect the ongoing negotiations.<br />
</blockquote></em></p>

<p>It's not like we in Texas already have such a huge surplus of public lands that we should be selling off 45,000 acres of a "very special place" to a resort owner with the excuse of using the money to purchase 25,000 acres of inholdings.  In this huge state, the total area of managed parklands and wildlife management areas is only <a href="http://www.texasep.org/html/lnd/lnd_5pub_acq.html">1.3 million acres</a>.  This proposed sale is several percent of that!</p>

<p>And the excuse for the secrecy doesn't fly&#151not if the Parks Director has the public interest at heart, at least.  Bring this out into the light of day, and we'll see if it survives the exposure.<br />

                                <p>Blogger and D.C. politico Matthew Yglesias has <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/6/16/13119/3070">arrived in Texas</a>—Fort Worth specifically—for apparently the first time in his still young life:</p><blockquote><p><em>My flight got in an hour earlier than I thought it would thanks to the time zone change (like a typical east coast elitist, I think I subconciously assumed there was just a big leap from Eastern Time to Pacific Time somewhere over the rockies) and so far the very small portion of the Metroplex I've seen utterly fails to live up to stereotype. DFW airport looks like . . . an airport! The Fort Worth suburbs driven through en route to downtown look like . . . suburbs! Downtown Fort Worth seems lovely, nobody says &quot;howdy!&quot; (n.b., my Texas-born roommate is constantly saying &quot;howdy!&quot;) or wears outlandish hats. Main difference is that the Starbucks has SBC WiFi instead of TMobile WiFi. Also, the coffee is substantially cheaper than in NYC, DC, or Boston.<br /><br />...</em></p>

<p><em>I'm beginning to think this whole Red versus Blue thing is even more all hype than it obviously was already. </em></p></blockquote><p>While I'm happy to see Matt debunking the &quot;whole <a href="../../../2004/11/abandon_all_tal.html">Red</a> versus <a href="../../../2004/11/yet_another_rea.html">Blue</a> thing,&quot; his impression of Texas is going to be very superficial if he sticks to airports, suburbs, and Starbucks.&nbsp; To get a broader view,&nbsp; albeit one still lacking in outlandish hats, perhaps he should travel on down here to San Antonio—or as one <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/rstinson/stories/MYSA061205.3A.stinson.305344313.html">local columnist</a> now describes it:</p><blockquote><p><em><p>

<p>
If you think the 2003-2005 City Council occasionally deteriorated into a political circus, wait till you see its successor when there is no Ed Garza, Enrique Barrera or Carroll Schubert around to limit the liberal wackiness.</p></em></p></blockquote><p>Who knew Deep Red Texas could see liberal wackiness in this day and age?</p>

<p>Perhaps someone should point out to columnist Roddy Stinson, though, that he really should be calling us BERKELEY SOUTHEAST.</p>

                                <p>From the <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared/tx/legislature/stories/05/26takings.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> today:</p><blockquote><p><em>There was less than a week left in the 79th
Legislative Session early Wednesday when an exhausted Todd Staples
walked off the Senate floor and said the words that most of Central
Texas' environmentalists and city officials longed for — and some of
its landowners and developers have feared.</em></p>

<p><em>The Republican senator from Palestine said legislation that would
have put a price tag on city environmental regulations was probably
dead.<br /><p>&quot;I think the votes were there to block it,&quot;
Staples, the measure's Senate sponsor, said. &quot;It doesn't look real
promising at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet foes of the measure, House Bill 2833, marked their apparent
victory with dread. While the measure's prospects have dimmed in recent
days — dragged down by a fraying coalition of cities and an unusual
collection of Central Texas power players — no one was ready to bury it.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think you can really call a bill dead until the end of the
session,&quot; said John Hrncir, Austin's government relations officer and a
field general in the battle to kill the proposal.</p></em></p></blockquote><p><p><a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/05/hb-2833-dies.html">Matt</a> reports the news from the <a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/">Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance</a>:</p></p><blockquote><p><em>This
is the last night (broadly speaking now, near 2 a.m.) that House bills
may be heard on the Senate floor on second reading. The Lt. Governor
just announced that the bill they are discussing now, HB 1434, will be
the last bill of the evening; and indeed that bill was just killed on a
point of order since it was after midnight.<br /> </em></p>
<div><em>HB
2833 is dead, unless its language reappears in some other legislation,
and the options for that with time running out at this point are gone
unless the language has already been sneaked into a bill somewhere else
that we haven't caught.</em></div></blockquote><p>Looks like the public interest may have won this round in the battle.&nbsp; Great news.</p>

<p>Stay vigilant, however.</p><blockquote><p><em><span class="cxnshared"><p>But there is no shortage of ways at the
Capitol to resuscitate legislation. Dan Wheelus, a lawyer for the
Landowners' Conservancy who wrote House Bill 2833, said he wasn't ready
to do a postmortem on the proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of talk right now,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation is still somewhat fluid.&quot;</p>
<p>The bill's opponents, meanwhile, are working nearly as hard to keep
it dead as they did to kill it. While Sturzl said the Municipal League
is largely out of the fight, he understood his former comrades'
smoldering concern.</p>
<p>&quot;My motto is: 'Paranoia pays,' &quot; Sturzl said. &quot;I don't ever say
that's over, ever, until they go home. That's the only safe course.&quot;</p></span></em></p></blockquote>
