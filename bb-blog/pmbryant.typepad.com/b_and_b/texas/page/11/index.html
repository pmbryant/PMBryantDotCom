The Kind that Isn't fun, Gaining Steam in the Senate Today" href="http://www.pinkdome.com/archives/2005/04/waterfight_the_1.html#comments">PinkDome</a> reports that this morning, the Texas Senate will vote on one of the atrocious anti-environmental bills they <a href="../../../2005/03/texas_legislatu.html">have</a> <a href="../../../2005/03/update_on_texas.html">been</a> <a href="../../../2005/04/state_sen_madla.html">considering</a>:&nbsp; Madla's bill to make local land use regulations more ineffective than they already are.</p>

<p>Pink Dome's recommendations:</p><blockquote><p><em>These bills serve no public purpose but allow developers to build at
higher densities for higher profits than ever before. SB 848/HB 1704
are developer dream bills that destroy local control of development and
water quality.</em></p>

<p><em>Your help is crucial to STOPPING these bills. Here’s what you can do:</em></p>

<p><em>1) Call your State Senator Tuesday Morning before 11 a.m. That is the
only way they will know you OPPOSE 848 before they go to the Senate
floor.</em></p>

<p><em>2) Call your State Representative next and tell them you OPPOSE HB 1704.</em></p>

<p><em>3) Come to the GEAA [<a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/">Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance</a>] press conference on these bills at the Capitol, E1.002 at Noon on Tuesday.</em></p></blockquote><p>I have some phone calls to make.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>What is this new organization that is pushing a 
<a href="../../../2005/04/yet_more_antilo.html">bill</a> 
in the legislature that would <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared/tx/legislature/stories/04/8takings.html">restrict</a> Texas communities' 
ability to regulate development and protect water quality?&nbsp; They certainly appear to be well-connected, as they already have the GOP Texas Agricultural Commissioner, Susan Combs, and at least one state representative from each party introducing this legislation for them.</p>

<p>
They call themselves the &quot;Texas Landowners Conservancy.&quot;&nbsp; 
The name is a clear effort to associate themselves in the public's mind 
with well-regarded, non-political conservation groups such as the 
<a href="http://nature.org/">Nature Conservancy</a> and the 
<a href="http://www.hillcountryconservancy.org/why.php">Hill Country Conservancy</a>—groups
that buy up land and conservation easements in order to preserve as much undeveloped land,
and the plant and wildlife it contains, as possible.&nbsp; 
The intended association extends to the appearance of the Landowners Conservancy website, 
which is dominated by shades of green and brown and contains many images of majestic oak 
trees so typical of rural central Texas landscapes. 
</p>

<p>Yet, in contrast to those images, the Landowners Conservancy 
is fighting for their alleged right to pave over at least 45% of undeveloped land, irrespective of any negative affect this would have on surrounding communities' water quality.
</p>

<p>
In their April 5 <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/050405/datu033.html?.v=6">press release</a>, 
the Landowners Conservancy describe themselves as 
&quot;a group of ranchers, land stewards and homeowners.&quot;&nbsp; 
On their <a href="http://texaslandowners.sitestreet.com/3/About_Us.html">website</a>, 
they go further, saying that they work to &quot;enhance the environment,&quot;
are &quot;deeply committed to the environment,&quot; and 
&quot;support legitimate environmental protection measures.&quot;&nbsp; Only after all that do
they mention that&nbsp; 
&quot;[we] are invoking a Constitutional stance that any governmental takings 
should fairly compensate landowners for their property.&quot;&nbsp; This is 
precisely the <a href="../../../2005/04/yet_more_antilo.html">agenda</a> of the long-standing &quot;takings&quot; movement that aims 
to prevent regulation of destructive land practices by making such 
regulation prohibitively expensive.
</p>

<p>
So who are these people exactly?&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>
Take Ted Stewart, the first member listed on the Landowners Conservancy '<a href="http://www.texaslandownersconservancy.org/3/About_Us.html">About Us</a>' page:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Ted Stewart</strong><strong> -</strong> Ted and his wife, Suzanne, relocated to
Austin from Odessa 13 years ago to live in the Texas Hill country. Ted
has spent more than a decade to revitalize his once overgrazed property
and improve water flow through cedar eradication, clearing nearly 3,000
acres. He has raised cattle with minimal impact on property and is
currently converting a portion of his ranch into a wildlife area. He
holds a BA degree in Chemistry from the University of Alabama.</em></p>
<p><em>Ted is an active participant in the &quot;Southwest Travis County Growth
Dialogue Process&quot; charged with creating a blueprint for future land
uses in western Travis County. Ted serves on the advisory boards of the
Ronald McDonald House and the Capital Area Boy Scouts. He and Suzanne
have four children and five grandchildren. </em> </p></blockquote><p>All well and good, but for some reason his occupation is not described.&nbsp; Not even alluded to.&nbsp; Some Google searching reveals the existence of a 
Ted Stewart involved with zoning changes in the village of 
<a href="http://64.233.187.104/search?q=cache:c-1OqMQbkrAJ:www.ci.bee-cave.tx.us/anm/minutes101299.htm+%22ted+Stewart%22+%22Bee+Cave%22&amp;hl=en">Bee Cave</a>, 
which is in western Travis County, in 1999:
</p><blockquote><p><em>Roger Pearson, a resident of Lake Pointe and a representative for Citizens for a Livable Bee Cave, 
came before the Board. He remarked that Mr. Stewart 's Juniper Trace project is a good neighbor to 
Lake Pointe. But he is concerned about the issues that come with a multi-family project with an 
85% impervious cover.
</em></p></blockquote><p>

From this and other sources, I get the impression that Mr. Stewart of western Travis County, 
is heavily involved in the real estate development business.&nbsp; 
</p>

<p>Further evidence comes from the January 1, 1999 edition of the 
<a href="http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/1999/01/04/focus4.html">Austin Business Journal</a>
(emphasis added):
</p><blockquote><p><em>
If plans set into motion by Key Enterprises bear fruit, 
Austinites may have the opportunity to purchase $150,000 to $200,000 homes near Lakeway.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The company, which specializes in both pipeline construction and real estate, 
is the purchaser of 120.775 acres at General Williamson and Highland drives. 
<strong>Owner Ted Stewart already has a deal in the works to sell the land to a 
Dallas real estate developer.</strong>
</em></p>

<p>
<em><strong>&quot;My investment strategy is to buy raw land, and do some preliminary planning,&quot; Stewart says. 
&quot;We identify a market and sell to a developer.&quot;</strong>
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Stewart says the area is saturated with high-priced estate lots and is ripe for 
one- to one-and-three-quarter-acre lots at a cost of around $60,000 each. 
Even before the land purchase was made, he aimed to set up this type of development.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;We worked backwards,&quot; he says. &quot;We started off to develop $150,000 to $200,000 homes. 
We conducted a feasibility study, located this land and purchased it. 
As part of our deal [with the developer], we guarantee that streets, 
water lines and utilities can be installed within the budget that we have proposed. 
<strong>That's our core business, offering a turnkey package -- land with the improvements in place.&quot;</strong>
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The development deal is not yet inked much less dried, but Stewart 
does not anticipate a problem.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;There are people standing in line to buy $60,000 lots,&quot; he says. 
&quot;That area out there has the need for nice, single-family lots, and this 
land is accessible to both lakes and several golf courses. It's right near the bridge, 
halfway between Bee Cave and Round Rock.&quot; 
</em></p></blockquote><p>

Is this really the same Ted Stewart involved with the Landowners' Conservancy.&nbsp; After all,
it's probably not that uncommon a name.&nbsp; What are the odds?
</p>

<p>Virtually 100%, I'd say.&nbsp; The giveaway is the 
<a href="http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/agenda/2005/zap_021505.htm">minutes</a> 
of the City of Austin
Zoning and Platting Commission meeting of Februrary 15, 2005.&nbsp; See item #28:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
28. Final Plat: C8-04-0164.1A - Cypress Bay-Lake Austin Final
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Location: N. Capital of Texas Hwy. At FM 2222 Rd., Bull Creek / Lake Austin Watershed
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Owner/Applicant: Key Enterprises, Inc. (Ted L. Stewart) (Ron Amini)
</em></p></blockquote><p>

Ron Amini is the third member of the Executive Committee listed on
the website of the Texas Landowners Conservancy.&nbsp; His apparent business 
connection with Key Enterprises and Ted Stewart is <a href="http://www.texaslandownersconservancy.org/3/About_Us.html">not mentioned</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Ron Amini -</strong> As a University of Texas alumni in
Petroleum Engineering, Ron returned to Austin in 1997 and purchased a
ranch on Cypress Creek.</em></p>

<p><em>He has implemented a Wildlife/Agricultural plan to include riparian
management and bird counts, providing habitat as well as supplemental
food for birds and other wildlife.&nbsp; He had participated in cedar
clearing programs and will work with officials to conduct prescribed
burns for the ranch, to help return it to its original state.&nbsp; </em></p>

<p><em>Ron was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, raised in Midland, Texas, and lived in San Antonio before moving to Austin.</em> </p></blockquote>

<p>
William Horabin, the fourth member of the Executive Committee, does
not appear to be a real-estate developer himself, but he does appear to have a history of 
<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2001/08/06/story6.html?jst=s_cn_hl">selling land</a> 
to real estate developers:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
William Horabin owns the land. However, it is under contract to Austin-based 
Land\Creek Development, a commercial division of Ash Creek Homes Inc.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Scott Taylor, project director at Land\Creek Development, says his company intends 
to develop five buildings with 12,000 square feet each. The estimated price tag 
for the project, called Park Bend Plaza, is $9 million.</em></p></blockquote><p>This, too, is not mentioned by the Landowners Conservancy:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>William C. Horabin -</strong> A lifetime outdoorsman, Bill
relishes life on his ranch where he raises quail for release into a
natural hill-country habitat.&nbsp; He has taken an over-grazed ranch and
restored natural grasses, eliminated erosion and provided natural
sources of water along with protein feed for wildlife.&nbsp; After clearing
250 acres of cedar from the property, he is especially pleased to find
the seeps and springs that have appeared as a result.&nbsp; His Western
Travis county ranch is a prime example of how land stewardship benefits
the environment.</em></p>

<p><em>Bill, a native of New Mexico and a graduate of the University of New
Mexico has lived in Austin for 26 years.&nbsp; He has held executive
positions in the financial services industry in New York, Oklahoma
City, Dallas and Austin, and in the long-term healthcare industry. 
Bill's community activities include work with the Austin Chamber of
Commerce and Seton Hospital,&nbsp; as well as promoting health-related
causes. Bill has three children.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, this is not a new tactic for special interests who suspect that their cause has little popular support:&nbsp; form an alleged &quot;grassroots&quot; group in an attempt to
deceive the general public.&nbsp; 
In this case, a group of real-estate developers have formed a group 
that gives a superficial appearance of being extremely interested in general environmental protection, while its true interests are personal and monetary.
</p>

<p>
If the Texas Landowners Conservancy does not intend to deceive, why do they not 
mention the real estate business interests of Stewart, Amini, and Horabin?
Why do they decorate their website with colors and 
pictures of natural landscapes when they desire to protect their so-called right to 
pave over at least 45% of the landscapes they own?
Why do they choose a name for their organization that echoes the names of
organizations with vastly different, even conflicting, goals?
</p>

<p>
Real estate developers are certainly justified in banding together just like any other
group of citizens.&nbsp; But pushing your interests via deception is a despicable and dishonorable practice.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Dem state Sen. Armbrister of Victoria 
may have a thing or two to learn from his colleagues
when trying to restrict local governments' ability to regulate development
that affects water quality.&nbsp; His bills, as I <a href="../../../2005/03/texas_legislatu.html">wrote</a> <a href="../../../2005/04/edwards_aquifer.html">about</a> last week, outright prohibit cities from regulating the amount of impervious
cover or to do anything else to establish rules relating to water quality.
</p>

<p>

Some of his colleagues are taking a different, more subtle, 
<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA040605.15A.lege_land.1acb03f85.html">approach</a>:&nbsp; make 
cities pay developers not to pollute the water supply:
</p>

<p></p><blockquote><p><em>
Texas Agriculture Commissioner Susan Combs and state property rights advocates 
are pushing a new law that would require cities to pay landowners if environmental 
regulations harm their property values.
</em></p>

<p><em> 
...
</em></p>

<p><em>
It's a law that critics charge will gut the ability of cities like San Antonio 
and Austin to protect the Edwards Aquifer 
by making them pay property owners for limiting impervious cover—the 
percentage of a piece of property that can be paved or built out—to 
anything less than 45 percent.
</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;It looks like this bill would be devastating,&quot; said Brad Rockwell, deputy 
director of the Austin-based Save Our Springs Alliance. &quot;It in effect sets 
impervious cover at 45 percent. And science shows that anything above 10 or 15 percent 
impervious cover pollutes the aquifer.&quot; 
</em></p>

<p><em>
...
</em></p>

<p><em>
The legislation is sponsored by Rep. Robby Cook, D-Eagle Lake, and 
Sen. Todd Staples, R-Palestine, and supported by the Texas Landowners Conservancy.
</em></p>

<p><em>
The city of San Antonio currently sets impervious cover limits at 30 percent 
for residential development, but groups like the Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance 
are calling for more stringent controls over the aquifer recharge zone. 
Annalisa Peace, the alliance's executive director, said the proposed bills 
would make that economically impossible.
</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;If these two bills are passed, it pretty much takes away the municipalities' 
ability to protect the water supply,&quot; she said.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Attorney Dan Wheelus, who is representing the Texas Landowners Conservancy, 
disagrees, saying the legislation protects property owners while leaving cities 
the ability to impose whatever rules they think necessary—at a price.</em> 
</p></blockquote><p>

This is actually an old approach of the extreme &quot;property rights&quot; advocates—who 
are very hard to distinguish from large corporate interests, such as mining
companies and real estate developers.&nbsp; And if Bush and the GOP get their way 
in stacking the courts with extreme conservative ideologues, this will become standard practice for attempts by governments—local, state, and federal—to 
regulate land use all over the country. 

</p>

<p>In early 1995, when the Gingrichites had just taken over Congress and were
attempting to legislate such so-called &quot;takings&quot; policies, 
the New York Times <a href="http://worldpolicy.org/globalrights/environment/property%20rights2.html">published</a> 
an op-ed by a real-estate developer
who eloquently wrote of his opposition to such policies:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
As a homeowner and real estate developer, 
I believe in landowners’ rights and in preserving property values.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>That is precisely why I am against the so-called property rights bill 
passed by the House this month and comparable ones proposed in the Senate 
and in state legislatures throughout the country.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The details of the bills vary, but they would all establish a general rule. 
Taxpayers must pay a landowner when a zoning rule, environmental law or other 
governmental regulation limits the value of the land.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>At first glance, that may seem fair, even attractive. But on closer inspection, 
it is clear that such supposedly pro-landowner legislation would hurt most homeowners.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Many of the bills under debate in state legislatures would require that 
taxpayers pay landowners affected by zoning laws. But zoning laws have a purpose; 
they are typically designed to prohibit incompatible uses in the same area—for example, 
landfills or shopping centers in residential districts. So while a few landowners might 
make less money because they aren’t allowed create a landfill, the property values 
of the rest of the neighborhood are protected.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Similarly, the House has already passed a so-called takings bill targeted at 
wetland, water and wildlife laws that would require taxpayers to pay owners for 
foregone profit. In the Senate, Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, has introduced 
a bill that would require payment to landowners affected by any environmental 
or safety standard, including Federal rules that require cleaning up of toxic 
sites, prevent strip mining from ruining landscapes, keep air and water clean 
and limit development in flood-prone areas.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Yes, these standards might limit the potential profit from some land or even 
prohibit development in some areas, which could lower the value of the property. 
But the rules raise or protect the value of surrounding homes.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The advocates of these laws seem to have ignored the cliche that the factors 
that most affect home values are location, location and location. 
An incinerator built close by or polluted water will immediately reduce home values 
in a neighborhood. Coastal protection and wetland laws protect property values by 
keeping communities attractive and by buffering floods and ocean storms. 
A band of wetlands along the coast invariably increases the value of homes behind it.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>So under the new anti-regulation agenda, homeowners’ property values are threatened. 
Also, the sheer cost of paying property owners for their claims and the specter of 
continual litigation would dramatically undermine our environmental and zoning laws.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The new takings bills assume that landowners have the right to do anything 
they want with their property regardless of the impact on others. 
But I rely on a contrary view: property owners have a right to be 
protected against abuses by others.
</em></p></blockquote><p>

of polluters at the expense of the rights of everyone else,

                                <p><a href="http://www.pinkdome.com/archives/2005/04/index.html#a000241">PinkDome</a> has posted an update, from a press release by the <a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/">Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance</a>, on Dem state Sen. Madla's and his GOP co-sponsors' attempt to <a href="../../../2005/03/update_on_texas.html">override local regulation</a> in favor of the interests of real estate developers.&nbsp; It is not good, as the bill was apparently passed out of Madla's committee yesterday on short notice:</p><blockquote><p><em>TEXAS- The Intergovernmental Relations Committee scheduled a second
public hearing for Senate Bill 848 in response to opposition by
community groups and environmentalists. The hearing was set for
Wednesday April 6th in Senator Frank Madla’s Intergovernmental
Relations committee, but Monday Senator Madla changed his mind and
called for an immediate vote at his desk where the public was not able
to comment or witness the votes. </em></p>

<p><em>Senate Bill 848 is a developer’s dream bill that focuses on granting
more powers to developers and dispenses with the need for a permit
application or a project. In addition Senate Bill 848 would allow a
developer to freeze city regulations merely by getting a utility to
agree to provide water, waste water, or electricity to the property
which is regularly done without any consideration towards current
regulations.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>Senator Madla has stated he was disappointed in the bill and would like
to change the bill to make it reflect the needs of his constituents.
Currently State Representative Mike Villarreal has offered an amendment
that gives cities and local communities authority to protect their
water resources instead of businesses and developers.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Why, if he was so disappointed, did he change the schedule, override a scheduled public hearing, and call for an immediate vote?&nbsp; Madla has a lot of explaining to do.</p>

                                <p>From the blog named after the Texas capitol building, <a title="PinkDome.com: Aquifer Schmaquifer" href="http://www.pinkdome.com/archives/2005/03/aquifer_schmaqu_1.html#more">PinkDome</a>, comes an update on the&nbsp; proposed bills to gut local water quality regulation that I posted about <a href="../../../2005/03/texas_legislatu.html">yesterday</a>.&nbsp; The bills being considered are even worse than I learned yesterday.</p>

<blockquote><p>

<p><em>SB 848 and SB 574 expand the current Texas &quot;grandfathering&quot; law that<br />
allows developers to lock in cities' development regulations that will<br />
apply to a project years and decades before the project is designed or<br />
built.</em></p></p>

<p><em>* SB 848 allows developers to submit incomplete or defective
development applications by mail and lock in the city ordinances that
are in effect on the postmark date of the application even if the
project will not be constructed for decades. Also allows ordinances to
be locked in when a developer merely acquires a promise that utilities
will be provided to the site-a decision that doesn't have anything to
do with project density or design.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><em>* SB 574 allows developers to ignore current landscaping, tree
preservation and park dedication ordinances; the bill also restricts a
city's ability to set expiration dates for projects that sit dormant
for years without any progress yet retain their &quot;vested rights.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>And it seems they are going to be considered in committee tomorrow.  My Senator, Frank Madla is one of the bad guys, despite being in the Democratic minority.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Is the Texas legislature planning to strip the power of Texas cities to regulate water quality?&nbsp; Based on this <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA032605.1A.water_quality.1748eae11.html">article</a> in the San Antonio Express-News over the weekend, it looks like this may be the situation:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
Advocates for the Edwards Aquifer, already stunned by the pace of development over the recharge zone, are incensed by bills making their way through the Texas Legislature that would gut the protections that do exist.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Even a representative for local developers who helped craft the compromises at the heart of the current protective city ordinances said common sense should lead people to oppose most of the proposed bills.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Observers say passage of the bills would undo years of efforts by those in San Antonio to pass ordinances striking a balance between development and preservation, to limit the density and types of construction over the area where rainfall and streamflows refill the aquifer. 
</em></p>

<p><em>
...
</em></p>

<p><em>
State Sen. Kenneth Armbrister, D-Victoria, who tried two years ago to yank water quality powers from the Edwards Aquifer Authority, is the author of most of the developer-friendly bills.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Armbrister's Senate Bill 1363 says cities don't have the authority of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to regulate water quality and that a city can enforce water quality rules adopted prior to passage of this bill only to the extent that they agree with the standards and practices of the state commission.
</em></p>

<p><em>
That effectively would gut the aquifer protection measures approved by the San Antonio City Council in early 1995 and by Austin voters in 1992, said Brad Rockwell, deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance in Austin.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Another Armbrister bill, SB 1362, would strip away a city's ability to regulate within its extraterritorial jurisdiction the density or number of buildings or lots and the percentage of land covered by concrete, buildings and other nonporous surfaces. The bill specifically removes an exemption that covers the Edwards recharge zone outside San Antonio.
</em></p>

<p><em>
The Legislature is on a five-day Easter holiday and Armbrister couldn't be reached for comment Friday.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Rockwell said the Armbrister bills appear to target cities that sit above the Edwards Aquifer and have taken steps to protect their drinking water source — San Antonio, Austin, San Marcos, Buda, Dripping Springs, Lakeway, Sunset Valley and others.
</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;We've got a huge amount of consensus that these kinds of water quality regulations are crucial,&quot; Rockwell said. &quot;To me, it's a fairly easy question, what's more important — protecting an irreplaceable water supply from contamination or allowing huge profits and high intensity development on the part of a handful of developers?&quot;</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>First question:&nbsp; why the hell is a Democrat pushing these bills in a Republican-dominated legislature, doing the GOP's dirty work for them?</p>

<p>Prior to this article, last week, the Express-News published a <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/stories/MYSA032405.07B.allescomment.168ee2718.html">commentary</a>, by Richard Alles of Aquifer Guardians in Urban Areas and the Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance, warning of this attempt by some legislators to usurp the already limited power of Texas cities to regulate their own water quality and growth:</p><blockquote><p><em>

Sitting atop the Edwards Aquifer, one of the most precious and vulnerable water resources in the world, Central Texas cities have enacted rules that prevent contamination by inappropriate development. Some of these standards are hailed as the best in the country for balancing the needs of a growing community while preserving water supplies for future generations.
</em></p>

<p><em>
The problem is that no one has to comply because of state &quot;vested rights&quot; or &quot;grandfathering&quot; laws.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Not content that local water protection ordinances have applied to almost no development, state legislators seem determined to make sure no scratch of dirt or development fantasy remains without vested rights. Witness a profusion of bills that would radically expand what are already among the most developer-biased grandfathering laws in the nation.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Senate Bill 848, co-authored by Sen. Frank Madla, D-San Antonio, would allow developers to grandfather a project simply by dropping an incomplete application into a mailbox. Sen. Kenneth Armbrister, D-Victoria, has introduced SB 574, targeting tree preservation and park dedication ordinances. In addition, the legislation would exempt developers from impact fee increases and resurrect projects for which local permits have expired.
</em></p>

<p><em>
If you liked Pulte Homes' Encino Ridge clear-cut over the aquifer recharge zone, you will love these bills.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Developers claim the laws are needed to protect investments and prevent unfair rule changes while they are in the middle of a project. In reality, Texas has a law routinely exploited by landowners who have made no substantive investment in a project.
</em></p>

<p><em>
A San Antonio developer is suing the city claiming to be grandfathered back to 1927. Even though he hasn't turned a shovel of dirt in nearly 80 years, he claims to be exempt from all rules adopted in that time, including our stormwater drainage ordinance, which prevents him from flooding other peoples' property. Ironically, the same developer is suing the city over upstream development that is flooding his property.</em></p></blockquote><p>I have little clue what the prospects for these bills are, but given the GOP's dominance in the legislature, and that party's known affection for doing the bidding of large campaign contributors such as real estate developers, we should be extremely worried about these passing and act accordingly.&nbsp; Frank Madla, a Democrat mentioned as a co-author of one of these atrocious bills, and my state Senator, will be hearing from me, and hopefully from many others.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From the San Antonio Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA022405.06B.redistrict2ed.d8c5650a.html">editorial page</a>, I see that Texas Senator Jeff Wentworth from San Antonio is going to once again try to reform the way redistricting works in Texas.&nbsp; Yes, he is a Republican.&nbsp; Yes, much to my disappointment, he went along with DeLay's slimy re-redistricting back in 2003.&nbsp; But yes, he appears to still want to do redistricting the right way.</p><blockquote><p><em>Sen. Jeff Wentworth, R-San Antonio, will carry legislation again this year to create a bipartisan redistricting commission that would wrest from the Legislature the power of redrawing political lines.
<p>Wentworth has introduced a similar constitutional amendment in every legislative session since 1993. This year, however, he can count on an unexpected ally: The Terminator.</p>
<p>California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has proposed a similar measure in his state. Like Wentworth, he faces legislative opposition from Democrats and fellow Republicans, with members of both parties reluctant to give up the power of the gerrymander</p></em></p></blockquote><p>I was wondering what bloggers more experienced with the ins and outs of Texas politics thought about this.&nbsp; Via <a href="http://www.technorati.com/cosmos/search.html?rank=&amp;url=Wentworth+redistricting">Technorati</a>, I only found a couple of posts on this topic:</p>

<p>Kevin Whited at <a href="http://www.publiustx.net/index.php?itemid=1903">PubliusTX</a>, who I am not very familiar with but who calls himself a conservative, doesn't like the idea.&nbsp; But based on his argument, I'm not sure he recognizes the flaws with the current system.&nbsp; He remarks that if voters don't like how legislators redistrict by gerrymander, then the voters should kick them out.&nbsp; This neglects the heart of the problem, which is that gerrymandering allows legislators to choose their own voters, not vice versa.&nbsp; With the gerrymandering system becoming more and more precise, the voters' alleged &quot;power to hold elected officials accountable&quot; is rapidly becoming a myth.</p>

<p>Charles Kuffner at Off the Kuff likes the idea, but rolls his eyes, in this <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004855.html">post</a> from January 31:</p><blockquote><p><em>There's a reason things like this are called &quot;quixotic&quot;. The Republican
leadership didn't spend six months in 2003 carrying Tom DeLay's water
so that Jeff Wentworth could undo it all.</em></p></blockquote><p>That was my initial reaction as well, but given Schwarzenegger's new initiative in California, and the relatively strong <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A15FB355F0C748CDDAB0894DD404482&amp;incamp=archive:search">interest</a> around the country in reforming redistricting, the dynamic may well be different this year.&nbsp; Or at least it has the potential to be if those of us who care make a stink about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gregsopinion.com/archives/005573.html#005573">Greg Wythe</a> appears to have a similar opinion, although he has said very little about the fight in Texas.</p>

<p>While it almost certainly won't happen this year, perhaps we can build some momentum behind the effort to help make it a reality not too far down the road.&nbsp; We certainly won't win this effort by giving up without even trying.&nbsp; Are we in this for the long term or not?</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004873.html#004873">Off the Kuff</a>, I found a new site called <a href="http://www.texasblogs.net/">Texas Bloggers</a>.&nbsp; It's apparently a group blog where any Texas blogger can sign up and post.&nbsp; A community of bloggers.&nbsp; Sounds like a great idea to both find out about other blogs in our state (besides the semi-famous ones like Off the Kuff, of course) and to publicize my own blog a little bit.&nbsp; So I just signed up.</p>

<p>Right now, including myself, there are six San Antonio blogs listed.&nbsp; Politically, they appear to be a mixed bag.&nbsp; I've perused each of them briefly.</p>

<p><strong>B and B</strong>:&nbsp; Yours truly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dagney007.blogspot.com/"><strong>dagney's rant</strong></a>:&nbsp; Pro-Bush conservative.&nbsp; Reading list contains entries like &quot;GOP Bloggers,&quot; &quot;The Glenn Beck Show,&quot; &quot;Blogs for Bush,&quot; &quot;The Conservative Cat,&quot; etc.&nbsp; Recent posts have titles like &quot;Proud of My President,&quot; and &quot;Shillary the Chamaeleon = Warning!&quot;&nbsp; Here is his mission statement, posted at the top of his site, right under the title:</p><blockquote><p><em>This is where I will put my upsets, resentments, reasonings and logical
commentary on why liberalism is a threat to the United States of
America! Dagney Taggert is a character from Ayn Rand's &quot;Atlas
Shrugged&quot;, but she was also my teacher. She taught me the fallacy of my
liberal upbringing. If you are a liberal, you may see some of the
fallacy of it here, too...unless you're braindead!</em></p></blockquote><p>Yikes!&nbsp; Looks like we're not going to agree on much.<br /><strong><br /><a href="https://expressnewswatch.blogspot.com/">S. A. Express-News Watch</a> </strong>:&nbsp; His mission statement:</p><blockquote><p><em>Welcome to Express-News Watch, where I shine the light of truth and
justice on the liberal bias of my hometown &quot;newspaper,&quot; the San Antonio
Express-News.</em></p></blockquote><p>Uh, the Express-News endorsed Bush in two out of the last two Presidential elections.&nbsp; So this is looking like another one I'm not going to agree with very often.</p>

<p><a href="https://cernigsnewshog.blogspot.com/"><strong>NewsHog</strong></a>:&nbsp; This is more like it.&nbsp; Three contibutors, one of whom (&quot;Mr. M&quot;) has this statement in his profile:</p><blockquote><p><em>Born and raised in California and displaced to Virginia, I'm the
original Red State Liberal, fighting the good fight, trying to open the
eyes of the sheep to the beauty of TRUE democracy, and TRUE patriotism.
Swinging from left field deep in the heart of the Reality Based
Community, I'm on a mission to help all the other Red State Liberals
stand their ground and begin the long hard fight of turning some of
those red states blue.
Mr. M</em></p></blockquote><p>Wait!&nbsp; He's not in San Antonio, or even Texas.&nbsp; I guess one of the other contributors is a Texan (perhaps &quot;Cernig,&quot; who appears to have created the blog, based on its URL).&nbsp; The blogroll for this site includes left-leaning sites such as &quot;AlterNet,&quot; &quot;Donkey Rising,&quot; &quot;Left of Center,&quot; &quot;Political Animal,&quot; &quot;The Left Coaster,&quot; and more.<br /><a href="https://www.rhetoricrhythm.blogspot.com/"><strong><br />Rhetoric &amp; Rhythm</strong></a>:&nbsp; Another fellow Democrat, apparently.&nbsp; The author is a 38-year old editor at a &quot;weekly business paper.&quot;&nbsp; Recent post titles include:&nbsp; &quot;Bush's aid promises falling short,&quot; &quot;Another liberal voice silenced,&quot; and &quot;Second Term Curse.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.arellis.net/online_journal.html">Roscoe Ellis</a></strong>:&nbsp; His posts, at least based on a quick glance, look more personal than political.&nbsp; But he doesn't appear to be a big fan of Hillary Clinton, with one post entitled &quot;Struck Down by God?&quot; about Clinton's recent on-stage collapse.</p>

<p>So with my addition, it's roughly an even split for San Antonio for the time being.&nbsp; Later I'll have to peruse the blogs from the rest of the state.</p>

<p>Ridiculous, you may say.&nbsp; Until two weeks ago, no one even knew there would be a new election for this seat.&nbsp; How could anyone decide to run for office, mount a campaign, and get elected in such a short time span?

</p>

<p>No doubt, that's the idea, as Ken Rodriguez points out in the <a title="MySA.com: Metro | State" href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA012605.3A.krod.444f545e.html">San Antonio Express-News</a> today:</p><blockquote><p><em>Four candidates are running to succeed Jones, and it is perhaps like no 
race you've ever seen.</em></p>

<p><em>One day the candidates are filing. The next they're practically waiting for returns.</em></p>

<p><em>If you're a new resident of District 121 and want to get to know the candidates — Paul Silber, Rose Spector, Glen S. Starnes and Joe Straus III — forget it.</em> 
<em><span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody">

<p>By the time you read their bios, the polls will be closed. 
</p> <p>If you're new to District 121, all you know for sure is that the winner will be somebody whose last name begins with the letter &quot;S.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p> <p>In a race that begins and ends so quickly, you have almost no chance to win unless you're anointed to win. Which means you need the blessing of the prominent and the powerful.</p>

<p>The anointed one appears to be Straus. In a heavily Republican district, Straus has the support of influential GOP leaders, including U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith.
&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></span></span></em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004794.html#004794">Rose Spector</a> is the Democrat in the race.&nbsp; And a prominent one as well, as she was apparently one of the last statewide elected Democrats in Texas, as a Texas Supreme Court Justice in the 1990s.</p>

<p>She's quick, and already has a <a href="http://www.rosespector.com/">campaign website</a> up and running (via <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004830.html">Off the Kuff</a>).&nbsp; We should help her out in this short, uphill race.&nbsp; The district includes Alamo Heights and a good chunk of northeast San Antonio, and, as such, is obviously strongly Republican-leaning.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://blog.dccc.org/mt/archives/001712.html" title="The Stakeholder :: Mark Your Calendars">The Stakeholder</a>, the DCCC weblog, news comes that the Texas re-redistricting court case may be resolved early next year.&nbsp; The issue, thanks to the Supreme Court's earlier ruling, is apparently whether the lines drawn &quot;reflect a solely political intent&quot;.</p>
<p>The DCCC blog properly argues that if this case can't meet that standard, then nothing can.&nbsp; And they pull out this <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dallas/politics/columnists/tgillman/stories/121403dnnattexwatch.7564d.html">quote</a> from Jim Ellis, apparently Tom DeLay's &quot;point man&quot; on the re-redistricting:</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;We've said all along that our motivation was political. And our goal was to maximize the number of seats a Republican would have the chance to win in.&quot;<br /></em></p></blockquote><p>From the same article, I noticed this other quote from Ellis:</p><blockquote><p><em><span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody">&quot;We must stress that a map that returns [Martin] Frost, [Chet] Edwards and [Lloyd] Doggett is unacceptable and not worth all of the time invested into this project.&quot;<br /></span></span></em></p></blockquote><p><em></em>So there is some good news.&nbsp; Democrats indeed lost four seats from the Texas delegation due to the re-redistricting, but of the GOP's top three targets, only one (Martin Frost) fell.&nbsp; Chet Edwards and Lloyd Doggett won their elections and will be returning to Congress.</p>
