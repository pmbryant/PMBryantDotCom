		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Those interested in solving the legislative neglect of Texas' state parks and who will be in the Houston area on Friday, April 7, take note. On that day, there will be a forum—hosted by the University of Houston-Downtown, the Sierra Club, and the Texas Coalition for Conservation—called 'Concerned Public to the Rescue of Texas State Parks.' It will address plans on where to obtain the necessary money to adequately fund our parks. </p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/3745075.html">Houston Chronicle</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;We're hoping to give people the information they need to be effective advocates for the state park system,&quot; said Evelyn Merz, who is helping coordinate [the forum] at the University of Houston-Downtown.<br /><br />...<br /><br />&quot;How park funding got into this tremendous crisis is much less important than how we solve the problem — how we find a long-term solution to the funding issue,&quot; Merz said.<br /><br />To do that, the public and politicians need to grasp the gravity of parks' problems and see some potential methods of resolving it, she said.<br /><br />To that end, forum speakers will including Walt Dabney, director of the state parks division of Texas Parks and Wildlife, and Joe Turner, director of the City of Houston's parks and recreation department, to help explain underfunding's impact on parks and the public.</em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend. But perhaps we can put something like this together in San Antonio, and other cities around Texas, soon.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>An excellent summary of the Texas state park system's <a href="../../../2006/03/texas_state_par.html">current troubles</a> was provided yesterday by Rick Casey, former columnist for the San Antonio Express-News and current columnist for the Houston Chronicle. (His move a few years back was a big loss for our local paper.) Some <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/casey/3739788.html">excerpts</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>It seemed like a great idea about 15 years ago.<br /><br />Texas state parks had always been a budgetary stepchild, so the Legislature decided to dedicate some of the money from the tax on sales of sporting goods to fund the parks.<br /><br />They didn't want to gold-plate the parks, you understand, so the fund would be capped at $32 million. That amount would also include some money for development of city and county parks.<br /><br />...<br /><br />But a few years ago, the legislators who couldn't properly fund schools or health insurance for children in low-income families not surprisingly also decided they couldn't properly fund parks.<br /><br />They cut the $32 million for parks, which had been set way back in 1993 and had not been adjusted for inflation, to about $20 million.<br /><br />At first the state Department of Parks and Wildlife responded the way organizations typically do when their budgets are pinched.<br /><br />...<br /><br />&quot;Last year we ran out of wiggle room,&quot; said Parks Director Walt Dabney. &quot;In November we eliminated 73 positions and cut back operations in about 50 parks.&quot;<br /><br />What we have is a parks system that is held together by rubber bands.<br /><br />The average age of the system's vehicles is 10 years, with an average of about one new vehicle purchase a year in the past four years.<br /><br />At Choke Canyon there is no potable water because the water system hasn't been repaired. Repairs from Hurricane Rita at the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site and at Martin Dies Jr. State Park near Jasper aren't expected to be completed until summer 2008 at the earliest.<br /><br />Many facilities are open only Fridays through Sundays, and many have discontinued or curtailed overnight camping.</em></p></blockquote><p>The B and B team visited Choke Canyon State Park, two hours south of our base, a couple Mondays ago for one of our excellent birding adventures (which I hope to write up something about soon). Fortunately, we had plenty of our own water, as we were surprised to find out there was no water in the park. Now, thanks to Casey, we know the reason why.</p>



<p>I was not surprised to find out that Choke Canyon had eliminated overnight camping, as I had read about that when the cuts hit last fall. But I was surpised and disappointed to discover that we would be kicked out of the campground area near the shoreline of the lake, where we having a very productive and enjoyable birding afternoon, at 4:30 PM—with hours of daylight left.</p>

<p>Choke Canyon is a fine park that deserves better treatment than this. Our state can do better.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Is the <a href="../../../2005/12/texas_state_par.html">dire situation</a> of the Texas state park system getting through to the members of the Texas legislature? An article in yesterday's <a href="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/outdoors/02/20parks.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> suggests that the answer is 'maybe—but don't count on it.'</p><blockquote><p><em>Texas state parks are funded primarily by a statewide sales tax on sporting goods, which generates about $105 million a year.<br /><br />The share for parks, however, has been capped by the Texas Legislature at $32 million, and even that number has been cut during a recent run of tight state budgets. The other $70 million is used for general state spending.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Rep. Edmund Kuempel, R-Seguin, former chairman of the House committee responsible for Parks and Wildlife oversight, said there is a chance the department could receive more money next year — but not from the sporting goods tax.<br /><br />&quot;That I would doubt very seriously,&quot; Kuempel said. &quot;Our first step will be to get (funding) back to where we were. Raising the cap is going to be a tough row to hoe.<br /><br />&quot;We should have been funding (state parks) at the cap level, but as money got tougher, (the Legislature) used the money to balance the budget. There was no anti-Parks and Wildlife sentiment,&quot; he said. &quot;We swept funds from a lot of agencies.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>If this statement was intended to make parks supporters feel better, I don't think it worked well.</p>



<p>Another Republican representative, Harvey Hildebran of Kerrville, is trying to get the cap on state parks' share of the sporting goods sales tax raised to $85 million. Explaining why he was unable to get that measure passed in the last session, he says:</p><blockquote><p><em>We had a lot of media and public support for it. Builders and developers were for it. The problem was, we didn't have the support in key positions in committee. The action wasn't as strong as the words.</em></p></blockquote><p>Builders and developers were for it! It is sadly typical of our GOP legislators (and a few Dems as well) to place such importance on the opinions of real estate developers.</p>



<p>I have to admit that I wasn't fully aware of the crisis in our state parks <a href="http://www.texascoa.org/news/ar_040205.php">at the time</a> Hildebran was trying to push his measure through. I was following several issues (out of many potentially disastrous bills) in the state legislature back in the spring of 2005, but this one never hit my radar screen. Next time around will be different, and it will be nice to be on the same side as the 'builders and developers' for once.</p>

                                <p>The B and B team voted just as the polls closed last night (one of us was literally the last one in the door), and helped state Rep. Carlos Uresti <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA030806.01A.uresti.410dc8c.html">knock off</a> incumbent State Sen. Frank Madla in the hotly-contested race for the Texas state senate. </p>

<p>In the GOP races for the State Board of Education, the sensible Republicans <a href="http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/06prirep.htm?x=0&amp;y=5381&amp;id=216#10">did not fare well</a>. Religious extremist, Leininger-supported, Cynthia Dunbar walloped Tony Dale, 64%-36%, while incumbent Dan Montgomery only pulled 35% in his race against former Rep. Ken Mercer, who has just under 50% (95 votes shy out of 50,000 with all the precincts reporting).&nbsp; </p>

<p>If Mercer stays under 50%, there will be a runoff and Montgomery is not dead yet.&nbsp; I wish I could have voted in that contest—it is my district, after all—but due to the closed primary system and the lack of a Democratic candidate for that state board seat, I feel a bit disenfranchised in that race.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Today is primary day in Texas. </p>

<p>National attention is focusing on how well the indicted former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay performs in his GOP primary and also on former congressman Ciro Rodriguez's <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/3/6/112321/6931">challenge</a> to incumbent Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar in a south Texas congressional district stretching from San Antonio to Laredo. The conservative, Bush-friendly, Laredo-resident Cuellar ousted then-incumbent, San Antonio-resident Rodriguez in 2004 by a few dozen votes in a primary election that saw the mysterious late appearance of a few dozen votes from Laredo—votes that pushed Cuellar over the top. Now Rodriguez is trying to win his seat back, and is hoping for a big turnout in the San Antonio portion of the district to do so.</p>

<p>Statewide attention is focusing on a few GOP primaries for the legislature, where five incumbents are being <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/03/james-leininger-and-leininger-five.html">challenged</a> by candidates funded virtually exclusively by the wealthy religious conservative James Leininger; on Chris Bell and Bob Gammage vying for the Democratic nomination for governor; and on the Democratic state senate <a href="../../../2006/02/uresti_v_madla_.html">Uresti v. Madla</a> race in my neck of the woods, which has amazingly gotten even uglier in the couple weeks since I wrote about it.</p>

<p>But behind these high-profile races, there is much more.</p>

<p>In the ongoing <a href="../../../2006/02/texas_textbook_.html">political fight</a> over the content of Texas public schools' textbooks, two GOP primaries for the Texas State Board of Education are worth keeping an eye on tonight. Religious extremists are looking to replace two members of the state board with two of their own. They already control at least five seats of the fifteen on the board. Apparently no Democrats are running in either race, so the GOP primary is where all the action is.</p>

<p>In district 10, stretching from the area north of Austin to the western suburbs of Houston, a moderate incumbent board member is stepping down. The GOP candidates in the race to replace her are Cynthia Dunbar and Tony Dale.</p>

<p>Dunbar is funded virtually exclusively by the family of notorious billionaire James Leininger, the same fellow funding primary challenges to many of the few remaining sensible Republicans in the state legislature. Dunbar homeschools her children and believes, according to a press release on her web site, that &quot;all students should be taught to be patriots.&quot; The Austin American-Statesman <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/02/20SBOE.html">reports</a>, &quot;Dunbar said that she would support an intelligent design curriculum and that the concept is 'at least as viable, if not more so, than evolution.'&quot;</p>

<p>Tony Dale is endorsed by the retiring incumbent, Cynthia Thornton, and, unlike Dunbar, sends his child to public schools. In further contrast to Dunbar, he is not an activist in the anti-evolution movement. The American-Statesman writes, &quot;Dale said that the [ID curriculum] issue has been settled and that unless the law is revisited, parents must teach those values at home and in church.&quot; He stresses 'local control' of schools, which is contrary to the desires of the extremists, who want to take over the State Board and then dictate standards for the entire state.</p>

<p>In district 5—which encompasses northern Bexar County (including my area), much of Austin, and most of the central Texas Hill Country—former San Antonio state legislator Ken Mercer and physicist Mark Loewe are challenging the incumbent board member Dan Montgomery in the GOP primary.</p>

<p>Mercer, based on his campaign website, is allying himself with the extremist faction. He wants more state control of public schools, and also wants to enforce ideological purity in the GOP. The San Antonio Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA022006.9G.boardofed.21081d49.html">quoted</a> him saying, &quot;I want to restore some of the power to the state board that was stripped by the Legislature in 1995. I have good relationships with folks in the House and the Senate and I want to work with them to restore that power.&quot; On the anti-evolution front, he says, according to the American-Statesman, &quot;We should let kids hear both sides of the story.&quot; This puts him firmly in the ID-promoting camp.</p>

<p>Incumbent Montgomery, like Tony Dale, is a &quot;local control&quot; promoter. This has apparently earned him the enmity of the extremist camp. Also, he says, as paraphrased by the American-Statesman, that &quot;the strengths and weaknesses of the theory of evolution should be taught but that science classes should be restricted to subjects supported by scientific evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>The other challenger, Mark Loewe, is a physicist from Austin. He doesn't fit neatly into the GOP schism over local versus state control of schools. The Express-News writes about him: &quot;Loewe frequently testifies before the state board and both the House and Senate education committees. He's developed detailed plans on how to save the state money on textbook purchasing. Loewe said cheaper textbooks would mean students could keep them and build their own resource library.&quot;</p>

<p>We'll know soon if the religious extremists succeed or fail in replacing two, somewhat sensible, GOP members of the State Board of Education with two more members allied with the cause of dictating ideological content of textbooks throughout the state's public schools and promoting the non-scientific dogma of Intelligent Design in science classrooms.</p>

<p>The San Antonio Express-News reported on <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA021706.01A.COUNCIL.1d1f53ce.html">Friday</a>:<blockquote><em>The [unanimous] council vote capped more than a year of hearings by the Vested Rights Task Force and back-and-forth negotiations between developers, environmentalists, the city Planning Commission and city staffers. </p>

<p>The biggest point of contention for developers is a new site plan requirement that must be attached to a project's fair notice form, detailing the project's lot layout, general building footprint with approximate square footage, the amount of impervious cover and how the land will be used. </p>

<p>Developers argued that such a level of detail for single-phase developments usually isn't determined until much later in the life of a project, well after permit applications have been filed. </p>

<p>"Nobody does a site plan at the beginning of the process," said lobbyist Ken Brown, who spoke against the UDC amendments. "What's in place is perfectly fine."</em></blockquote>What lobbyist Brown does not mention is that "what's in place" allows developers to claim vested rights by pointing to a virtually blank plat filed decades previously by a different owner (35 years previously in a specific <a href="../../../2006/01/vested_rights_a.html">case</a> I posted about last month).  "What's in place" allows developers virtually unlimited ability to ignore local laws.</p>

<p>What the city council is now requiring sounds like a reasonable alternative&#151;an alternative that may actually mean that communities have some control over how they grow.  The restrictions on developers are hardly unrealistic:<blockquote><em>The amendments will allow a developer to make changes to the number of buildings in a project within five years of filing fair notice and maintain vested rights, but only if the change does not increase the impervious cover and it does not increase the total square footage of the original project. </p>

<p>Developers also can make minor adjustments to a building footprint or changes to preserve trees without losing vested rights. </p>

<p>Councilman Art Hall said those provisions represented a middle ground of sorts by allowing some flexibility for developers to alter their plans. </p>

<p>"I think these are amendments both the environmental side and the development side can live with," he said.</em></blockquote>Given all the <a href="../../../2005/04/extortion.html">friends</a> that the developers have in the Texas state government, though, I strongly suspect that they will continue to fight for total victory&#151;where communities are powerless to do anything to protect their own citizens from the negative effects of unchecked growth.</p>

		<a href="../../../2006/02/uresti_v_madla_.html">Uresti v Madla:  Overview of a Texas Democratic primary bloodbath  </a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There is a heated Democratic primary campaign going on for the state senate district that encompasses my neck of the woods.  The long-time incumbent, Frank Madla, is being challenged by state representative Carlos Uresti.</p>

<p><img alt="District19map_1" title="District19map_1" src="../../../../photos/uncategorized/district19map_1.gif" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" />This <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/mt/archives/2006/01/4040_get_to_kno_6.html">district</a> is geographically huge.  (Here's a <a href="http://www.senate.state.tx.us/Icons/Dist_Maps/Dist19_Map.pdf">map</a>.)  It contains much of southern and western Bexar County, a broad finger into my area of northwest Bexar County, and a vast expanse of sparsely-populated west Texas&#151;practically all the way to El Paso, several hundred miles away.  Despite that great rural and desert expanse, nearly half the voters of the district reside in the San Antonio metropolitan area.</p>

<p>A couple months back, upon hearing of Uresti's challenge to Madla, I <a href="../../../2005/12/uresti_v_madla.html">asked</a> for more information to help me make up my mind who to support and vote for.  Sure enough, the local blogging community has come through, providing extensive coverage of this race.  (No doubt they wouldn't have bothered if I hadn't asked.  Right?)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.carlosuresti.com/"><img alt="Uresti_2" title="Uresti_2" src="../../../images/uresti_2.png" width="105" height="51" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a><a href="http://www.frankmadla.com/index.html"><img alt="FrankMadla" title="Madla" src="../../../images/madla.jpg" width="150" height="49" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>In particular, San Antonio bloggers Matt at <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/">Just Another Blog</a>, Cincinnatus at <a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com">The Jeffersonian</a>, and Eddie at <a href="http://theredstate.com/">The Red State</a> have posted repeatedly about events in the Uresti-Madla battle.  Joining them has been Houston blogger Charles Kuffner at <a href="http://offthekuff.com/">Off the Kuff</a> and the Austin group blog <a href="http://burntorangereport.com/">Burnt Orange Report</a>, which published interviews of both candidates in late January.</p>

<p>This has been an extremely negative campaign, virtually right from the start in December.  The rationale for Uresti's run is that Madla has not represented the people of his district well and not been a good Democrat.  Uresti's supporters, which include all of the blogs mentioned above (I have not seen a pro-Madla blog), have not been shy in tearing down Madla's recent record.  </p>

<p>And neither has Uresti himself, who stated in the opening of his interview at <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/mt/archives/2006/01/4040_an_intervi_2.html">Burnt Orange Report</a>:  "On too many bills, Frank crossed the aisle to vote with Republican leadership to balance our state’s budget on the backs of those who could least afford it. He became more interested in helping powerful special interests while kids went without health insurance, elderly people lost nursing home allowances, and state employee ranks were decimated for the benefit of a few big private interests. Frank’s votes were a slap in the face to me as a Texas Democrat, as a fellow legislator, and as a resident of the district he represents. I live where those children go without medical care. I see the results of his votes. I could have waited a few more years until he finally retired, but I don’t think the vulnerable constituents in his district can."</p>

<p>What are the specific charges against Madla?</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest issue Uresti's supporters have with Madla's record is Madla's tendency to allow harmful legislation introduced by the GOP leadership to advance through early stages of the legislative process when he has the power to kill it.  One bill, in particular, has raised their ire, as alluded to by Uresti in his statement above.  </p>

<p>Officially known as House Bill 2292, it was passed by the legislature in 2003, privatizing many of the state's human services functions at no net savings and cutting off many thousands of people from Medicaid and CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program.  Madla voted against the bill in the end, but apparently voted with Republicans on earlier procedural votes that could have stopped the bill in its tracks.</p>

<p>Madla's defense?  In a January article in the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA011206.01B.MadlaUresti.1772a09d.html">San Antonio Express-News</a>, he is quoted as saying, "I voted against final passage of HB 2292, and I was among those who fought for, and helped to restore, previous cuts in health and human services as quickly as were able to do so."  He also said, "I believe that I was elected to serve all of the citizens of Texas and primarily those who reside in the district I represent, not just those of one party or the other."</p>

<p>In his January interview at <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/mt/archives/2006/01/4040_an_intervi_5.html">Burnt Orange Report</a> (BOR), Madla said, "It is my observation that, for major legislation, it is best to allow the process to move forward with hopes that resolutions for the most problematic issues will be developed. When the end product did not seem to do that, I did not support the bill in its final form. As to the eventual verdict on privatization, the jury is still out on that."</p>

<p>This is clearly a recurring theme with Madla.  Last spring, I <a href="../../../2005/04/state_sen_madla.html">wrote</a> that "State Sen. Madla has a lot of explaining to do," after he took actions that allowed a pro-development, anti-local-regulation bill to advance through the legislative process despite his stated misgivings.  He voted against this bill (SB 848) in the end, but his earlier actions had allowed it to reach a final vote (where it passed by a depressingly large margin).</p>

<p>Uresti feels differently about how a legislator should behave when confronted with poor bills, telling BOR, "My time in the House also taught me this about the legislative process: some bills must be blocked and killed when you have the chance. Moving a bad bill 'through the process' just builds momentum that can’t be stopped in the end."</p>

<p>Another of the principal complaints against Madla is that he is too close to the Republicans in Austin.  Uresti's supporters highlight the fact that several GOP legislators and lobbyists are amongst Madla's supporters in his re-election bid.</p>

<p>None other than Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst was a <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/006635.html#006635">featured guest</a> at a fundraiser for Madla last month.  Two former aides to Governor Rick Perry and a former state senator, present lobbyist, and author of the aforementioned HB 2292, Arlene Wohlgemuth, also were listed as <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2006/01/wohlegemuth_red.html">attendees</a> at that fundraiser.</p>

<p>Madla's defense is that he's a bi-partisan kind of guy.  While some Republicans support him, so do plenty of Democrats.  The <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA021406.3B.notebook.d535f05.html">Express-News</a> wrote earlier this week, "Several Democratic heavyweights turned out Monday to vouch for [Madla's] bona fides, endorsing him at a media conference at the Menger Hotel. They included former Mayor Henry Cisneros, County Commissioner Tommy Adkisson, City Councilman Richard Perez, Constable Ruben Tejeda and Madla's Senate colleague, Leticia Van de Putte."  </p>

<p>Madla told BOR, "In the Senate, you have to be able to work with both sides of the aisle, and I've learned to do that with both moderate and conservative Republicans. Doing so does not mean that you have to give up your values or your party allegiance and loyalties, but you learn how to work together for the good of the whole state and for your own district."  He claims that as a result of his bi-partisan skills, he passed 68 bills last year.</p>

<p>Uresti's supporters counter that other prominent Democrats oppose Madla and support Uresti.  The most celebrated of these is a state senator from El Paso named <a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com/2006/01/conscience-of-senate-endorses-carlos.html">Elliott Shapleigh</a>, who has said, "The first vote that the (Senate) Republicans go to get is Frank Madla's."</p>

<p>The most recent, and most sensational, complaint against Madla arose out of the very fundraiser that sparked the above complaint.  He was filmed <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/02/frank-madla-doesnt-like-bloggers.html">saying</a>, "When I get to the state Capitol, I lock the Democratic Party in my trunk."  So the charge is that Madla not only is too close to the GOP establishment in this state, but that he doesn't respect his own political party.</p>

<p>Madla's defense here is that Uresti is running a campaign of dirty tricks, although the Uresti campaign denies that the person who taped the event worked for them.</p>

<p>Madla, on the other hand, is not above some tricks of his own.  A supporter of his managed to get an <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/01/frank-madla-buys-good-press_31.html">elementary school</a> named after Madla just as the primary campaign was starting to heat up.</p>

<p>So, after watching and reading about all this over the last few weeks, I have some definite ideas on how to vote come the March primary, though I have not yet made a final decision.  The charges against Madla that have been echoing around the Texas blogosphere in recent days appear damning on the surface, and Madla's own clumsy choice of words at the January fundraiser reinforces them.  But his staunch support from so many prominent Texas Democrats indicates that there is more to the story.</p>

<p>In addition, the anti-Madla rhetoric occasionally ventures into the realm of the absurd, risking tainting the credibility of the justifiable criticism.  Perhaps the most emphatic Uresti supporter amongst Texas bloggers, Eddie of The Red State recently <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2006/02/madlas_lies_and.html">wrote</a>, "[Madla] hates poor children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled. Now, he hates the Republicans who gave him ten of thousands of dollars. He can't have it both ways."  I greatly respect Eddie's work at The Red State, but such unbelievable statements are not going to convince anyone who is still on the fence.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, back when Uresti first announced, Eddie <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2005/12/carlos_uresti_t.html">wrote</a>, "Am I bias on this race? Hell yeah. I have worked for [Uresti] and believe in him from personal experience."  This is an angle I'd love to hear more about.</p>

<p>Large chunks of <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA020906.05B.Uresti_Donor.b5b4858.html">money</a> are flowing in to both sides of this fight, so it is likely to be very competitive.  Unfortunately, all the acrimony may make it hard for Democrats to unite behind the victor.  Given that Bush won a slight majority in the district in <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/par_rpts/current/senate/dist19/r8.htm">2004</a>, the general election may not be a sure bet for the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>Early voting starts on Tuesday, February 21 (only five more days!), while the official primary day is Tuesday, March 7.</p>

<p>For those who want to learn more besides what's available at the links above, <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/02/senate-district-19-full-story.html">Matt</a> has an excerpt from a detailed rundown of this race from the (subscription only) Quorum Report.

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The state government has been trying to foist toll roads on the citizens of Texas behind their backs.  As the plans become clear to more and more people, however, the opposition grows louder and stronger.  The issue is likely to play an important role in the state elections later this year.  </p>

<p>Carlos Guerra has an article in today's San Antonio Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA021206.01B.guerra.2ec1f8d.html">summarizing</a> the situation:<blockquote><em>It has taken awhile for people to understand what elected — and unelected — officials have planned for them, which is why only now are the Texas Department of Transportation's toll-road plans coming under intense fire. </p>

<p>When Gov. Rick Perry unveiled the Trans Texas Corridor, I warned that it could turn into a huge boondoggle. But few readers responded, and some called me an alarmist. And even in late 2004, Texas Transportation Commission Chairman Ric Williamson said that "in your lifetime, most roads will have tolls," and Time magazine asked if our state's plans weren't "a Big, Fat Texas Boondoggle." But only a few more people wrote in. </p>

<p>Recent columns about toll roads in the far North Side, however, triggered waves of e-mails from all over Texas expressing strong opposition to tollways and anger that voters are powerless to stop them. </p>

<p>"Why don't they put it out in the marketplace of ideas?" asked one. "If (toll roads) are really that great, people will vote for them." </p>

<p>It won't happen. While radically changing how Texas builds roads, lawmakers decided that road building is too important to let those who pay for them have a say. </p>

<p>TxDOT will turn some existing roads into tollways, and add toll lanes to other existing roads. You will have zip to say about it, or about plans for 4,000 miles of new toll roads — with railway and utility easements — that will be built on state land handed to private investors. The Trans Texas Corridor will take 584,000 acres of land in quarter-mile-wide swaths at a cost of an estimated $183.5 billion. </p>

<p>These projects are well on their way. But only now are many realizing that the "small" tollway proposals close to them are not isolated, one-of-a-kind projects, but part of a bigger scheme. Controversies are erupting throughout Texas, and very diverse constituencies are coalescing in opposition. Their only recourse may be at the ballot box, however.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Later, Guerra asks some fundamental questions:  "Can anyone explain how building more highways over the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone will not increase the chances of catastrophic spills? And why is there such a rush to build more highway miles when both San Antonio's and Austin's commute times are still way below the national average?"</p>

<p>He also suggests an answer.<blockquote><em>Check that group's Web site [San Antonio Mobility Coalition], and you will see that its membership is a veritable who's who of big construction interests. Could it be that these projects are more about fat construction contracts than about improving transportation?</em></blockquote></p>

<p>So we can all check out this suggestion, here is that <a href="http://www.samobilitycoalition.org/aboutUs.htm">web site</a>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Many science bloggers, led by famous radical militant biologist P.Z. Myers of <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a>, have been vigilant in keeping a close eye on the movement to force public schools in this country to teach Intelligent Design (aka, "ID") as a valid scientific alternative to evolutionary theory.  </p>

<p>A few days ago, Myers was particularly impressed with an op-ed written by <a href="http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/02/2dee_edit.html">James Dee</a> of Austin, published in the Austin American-Statesman, in which Dee attempts to dismantle the logic behind the ID-as-science concept.</p>

<p>What caught my attention, though, was the way Myers <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/02/texas_isnt_all_bad.php">presented</a> this article&#151;with the title "Texas isn't all bad" and the opening line "There's always Austin."  This, of course, prompted many defenses of this state, including one from me where I stated, without much thought:  "In particular, I don't see any of these force-ID-into-public-schools fights happening in Texas."</p>

<p>Another commenter, <a href="https://thoughtpimp.blogspot.com">Paul W.</a>, then reminded me of the textbook wars&#151;the decades-long struggle by conservative religious forces here to shape the content of the books being used for teaching youngsters in public schools.  These people are trying to do far more to twist the minds of the children of this state than just confuse them about the relative scientific validity of ID and evolution.</p>

<p>For example, back in 1996, according to a timeline from the <a href="http://www.tfn.org/publiceducation/textbooks/timeline/index.php">Texas Freedom Network</a>:<blockquote><em>Censors attempt to delete certain photographs in new textbooks, saying publishers went “overboard” in their inclusion of minorities. They also claim the textbooks overemphasize the cruelty experienced by slaves, demand that the age of Earth to be determined by biblical genealogy rather than fossil evidence and attempt to eliminate discussions of endangered animals and environmental issues.</em></blockquote>Fortunately, while the activist religious conservatives have had some successess, such as getting publishers in 2002 to "remove passages in social studies textbooks that have positive references to Islam and that note any negative characteristics of capitalism," they have apparently failed so far in their attempts to interfere with the teaching of evolution in science classes.</p>

<p>The most recent failure came a little over two years ago, and here is described in a <a href="http://www.texscience.org/files/discovery/index.htm">press release</a> of that era from <a href="http://www.texscience.org/index.php">Texas Citizens for Science</a>.<blockquote><em>On November 6, 2003, the Texas State Board of Education voted 11-4 to adopt all the biology books on the conforming list subject only to normal error correction by the Texas Education Agency staff. On November 7, all the books were adopted unanimously by voice vote with no dissent. I am happy to report that the biology texts were not censored, weakened, or modified in any way that would reduce their scientific accuracy, especially about the topics of evolution and the origin of life. Four anti-evolutionists on the Board, led by Dr. Don McLeroy, did attempt to adopt only two biology books on the conforming list and adopt the others on the nonconforming list, thereby reducing their sales, but they failed in this attempt.</em></blockquote>I somehow missed all this at the time, perhaps distracted by the upcoming Democratic primary for the Presidential election, but it is great news in retrospect.  And the textbook publishers' resistance to the followup attempts at behind-the-scenes initimidation by McLeroy and other anti-evolutionists is also great news.  Many thanks are due to organizations such as the <a href="http://www.tfn.org/">Texas Freedom Network</a> that helped in this achievement.</p>

<p>Of course, the story does not end there.  The activist religious conservative minority on the elected State Board of Education is still trying to increase the Board's power over textbook content&#151;power that was greatly restricted by the state legislature back in 1995.  The <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8FFOF800.html">Dallas Morning-News</a> reported on January 31:<blockquote><em>Texas Board of Education members aligned with social conservatives have asked the state attorney general to strike down restrictions on their power to review and reject the content of public school textbooks. </p>

<p>The request was initiated by Republican Terri Leo of Spring, one of five board members aligned with social conservatives and a major critic of the 1996 legal opinion that has limited board control over textbook content. </p>

<p>Leo requested the opinion with the approval of board chairwoman Geraldine Miller. </p>

<p>The ruling from Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott will be closely watched because of Texas' influence in the textbook industry. Many books are tailored to the state's wishes and then marketed in other states. </p>

<p>Battles over content could touch on the teaching of evolution, what students are told about birth control and sexual abstinence, and interpretations of history. </p>

<p>Leo's request for a new opinion argued that the original one issued by former Attorney General Dan Morales was "erroneous on its face" and should be reversed, restoring full board authority over textbook selection. </p>

<p>The letter did not mention that the Legislature has repeatedly rejected bills over the past decade that would have given the board more control to screening and reject textbooks it might deem inappropriate for students. </p>

<p>Former state Sen. Bill Ratliff, who wrote the 1995 law that stripped the board of many of its powers and turned them over to local school boards, said he was "very clear" about his intention to include authority for textbook selection. </p>

<p>Ratliff, a Republican who later served as lieutenant governor, told The Dallas Morning News that Morales' opinion correctly interpreted the law. </p>

<p>"Nothing has changed," Ratliff said. "I am still sure that was the intent of the legislation."</em></blockquote>This would appear to be a quixotic quest.  Or do the social conservatives have a reason to think that GOP Attorney General Greg Abbott will rule differently on this apparently clear-cut matter of law than the conservative Democrat Dan Morales did ten years ago?</p>

<p>For even more on the current situation, and the background details, see this recent <a href="http://www.wacotrib.com/opin/content/shared/news/nation/stories/2006/02/YOUNG_COLUMN_0203_COX.html">editorial</a> by John Young of the Waco Tribune-Herald.</p>

<p>This is all a reminder to me that just because I don't see a battle going on doesn't mean it isn't there.  </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Thanks to an attentive sister, last Friday I learned that the <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/travel/texasneighbors/stories/012906dntragovt.1f5e4b21.html">Dallas Morning-News</a> highlighted the San Antonio area's new wonder of a state park, <a href="../../../2005/05/just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon State Natural Area</a>.  And I believe it was at the top of the front page!  Should we be expecting a flood of Dallas-ites down here soon?</p>

<p>Here are some highlights from the <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/travel/texasneighbors/stories/012906dntragovt.1f5e4b21.html">article</a>:<blockquote><em>Its historical but off-putting name sounds like a new prison movie. But Government Canyon, the newest kid on the Texas Parks & Wildlife block, is an 8,622-acre gem, a mother lode of history, geology and scenery that almost went under the bulldozer's blade. </p>

<p>However, thanks to a national scandal and the passion of a small army of Texans, the state natural area in northwest Bexar County escaped development. Twelve years in the making, Government Canyon finally opened its gates in October. </p>

<p>The fact that Government Canyon is one of the state's eight natural areas rather than a park means that conservation, stewardship and education trump recreation. Not that there's a shortage of things to do at the remarkably serene sanctuary only 16 miles from the Alamo City. There are 20 picnic sites, a covered group pavilion with a huge limestone fireplace and barbecue pit and 41 miles of hiking and bike trails. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"We tried to keep the development footprint as light as possible," says Ranger Trey Cooksey, the canyon's assistant manager. "People should have places to go that aren't concrete." </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Given lean state budgets, Government Canyon probably will be the last addition to the Texas parks system for a long time. That makes this tranquil monument to public-private cooperation even more precious. </p>

<p>"All the stars aligned to make Government Canyon," says project manager Jason Corzine. "It's an oasis. Its potential will only be realized when every scrap of land around it is tract houses."</em></blockquote>Last addition to the state park system for a long time?  Not if <a href="http://www.texansforstateparks.org/default.asp">Texans for State Parks</a> can help it.</p>
