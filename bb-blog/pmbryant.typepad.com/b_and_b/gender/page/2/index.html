                                <p>Harvard president Larry Summers misrepresented, or at best ignored, the results of a sociological study in his talk earlier this week in which he claimed the possibility of innate differences in mathematical and scientific ability between men and women.&nbsp; Garance Franke-Ruta at The American Prospect's blog <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2005/01/index.html#005283" title="TAPPED: January 2005 Archives">TAPPED</a> highlights an article in the <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/today/article505363.html">Harvard Crimson</a> from Wednesday that says this:</p><blockquote><p><em><span class="a-text">Two sociologists whose research University
President Lawrence H. Summers cited at an economics conference Friday
said yesterday their findings do not support Summers’ suggestion that
“innate differences” may account for the under-representation of women
in the sciences. <p>University
of California-Davis sociologist Kimberlee A. Shauman said that Summers’
remarks were “uninformed.” The other researcher, University of Michigan
sociologist Yu Xie, said he accepted Summers’ comments as “scholarly
propositions,” although he said his own analysis “goes against Larry’s
suggestion that math ability is something innate.”</p>

<p>Xie and
Shauman presented their findings at the National Bureau of Economic
Research Friday afternoon, shortly after Summers’ remarks.</p>

<p>In an
interview with The Crimson last night, Summers stressed that he only
cited Xie and Shauman’s research as evidence that females are
underrepresnted among the top 5 percent of test-takers on standardized
assessments. Summers said the evidence for his speculative hypothesis
that biological differences may partially account for this gender gap
comes instead from scholars cited in Johnstone Family Professor of
Psychology Steven Pinker’s bestselling 2002 book The Blank Slate: The
Modern Denial of Human Nature.
</p></span></em></p></blockquote><p>So Summers' defense is that he didn't misrepresent Xie and Shauman's work, he just ignored it in favor of Steven Pinker's book.&nbsp; As for that book, Franke-Ruta writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>I haven't read this book, but if you look at the amazon.com readers'
comments, it appears that some female readers found its discussions of
rape and the maternal instinct highly offensive and sexist. <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/scienceandnature/0,6121,792159,00.html">One newspaper reviewer</a>
described Pinker's book, in 2002, as &quot;breathtaking, rabid stuff....
likely to reduce most university common-rooms to states of gibbering
apoplexy.&quot; (Mission accomplished, clearly.) If Summers based his
remarks in part on a reading of Pinker's book, the response he
generated was something that was not only predictable but predicted.</em></p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Summers is trying to <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/01/21/summers_harvard_faculty_meet/">smooth things over</a>, at least with his colleagues at Harvard:</p><blockquote><p><em>Continuing efforts to soothe professors angry about his remarks on
women, the president of Harvard University, Lawrence H. Summers, met
last night with faculty members who wrote to him this week that his
comments would hurt Harvard's ability to recruit top female scholars.</em></p>

<p><em>
Summers repeated the apology he has made at least twice in writing, according to spokeswoman Lucie McNeil.</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;It was a good meeting,&quot; she said. &quot;He apologized, and they moved on to
a discussion of a variety of steps the university can take to address
the issues, and they agreed to continue to address them in the coming
days.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>
Between a half-dozen and a dozen professors, members of Harvard's
official Standing Committee on Women, attended yesterday evening's
hourlong meeting at the Barker Center for the Humanities.</em></p>

<p><em>
The participants were reluctant to discuss details of the meeting for
fear of jeopardizing their ongoing discussions with Summers.</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;It was a constructive discussion on very difficult issues of
importance to the university,&quot; said Caroline Hoxby, a professor of
economics. &quot;The discussion is ongoing, and we believe there will be
some resolution on important issues next week.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Finally, the National Organization for Women, along with a certain female member of my household, yesterday <a href="http://www.now.org/press/01-05/01-20-Harvard.html">called</a> for Summers' resignation:</p><blockquote><p><em>The National Organization for Women calls for the resignation of
Harvard University President Lawrence Summers, who has failed to lead
the prominent (and previously all-male) university toward true
inclusion of women. His recent comments generated a firestorm of
response from Harvard/Radcliffe women who were outraged that he would
embarrass Harvard with such a public demonstration of sexism and
ignorance.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Summers' suggestion that women are inferior to men in their ability
to excel at math and science is more than an example of personal
sexism, it is a clue to why women have not been more fully accepted and
integrated into the tenured faculty at Harvard since he has been
president,&quot; said NOW President Kim Gandy. According to reports, the
number of female faculty receiving tenure has declined over the past
four years — down to just four of the last 32 tenure offers in the
school's Faculty of Arts and Sciences.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Harvard University holds itself out as the pinnacle of higher
education in this country,&quot; said Gandy. &quot;Such an esteemed institution
should set a standard for other colleges and universities — a standard
that Lawrence Summers appears unable to maintain.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Certainly, as UCLA professor Mark Kleiman's recent <a href="../../../2005/01/the_problem_goe.html">comments</a> illustrate, Summers' attitude of male superiority is far from unique in the academic world—and not even the worst example.&nbsp; So Summers' resignation as Harvard president alone will not solve anything.&nbsp; But his resignation is a necessary step for the fair treatment of women in acadmics, precisely because of the prevalence of this attitude.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A modestly prominent, moderately liberal academic blogger has weighed in on the controversy regarding the comments of Harvard president Larry Summers on the sparsity of women in academic science and engineering positions (see this <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/01/17/summers_remarks_on_women_draw_fire?mode=PF">article</a> from Monday's Boston Globe and these <a href="../../../2005/01/havard_presiden.html">earlier</a> <a href="../../../2005/01/a_good_rant_on_.html">posts</a> for the details).&nbsp; Unfortunately, this blogger, <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/">Mark A. R. Kleiman</a>, a professor of policy studies at UCLA, who I've been reading for over a year and whose writings I generally respect, has weighed in firmly on the wrong side.&nbsp; Even more repulsive, an argument he proffers could be used to justify male domination of every skilled field of endeavor.</p>

<p>First, here is an excerpt of what <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/_/2005/01/larry_summerss_gaffe.php">Kleiman</a> says about Summers' comments:</p><blockquote><p><em>My reader says:</em></p>

<p><em>1. Summers does or should realize that he is never speaking just as
an intellectual or as an economist, and that it is possible (and I mean
possible) that his comments were incompatible with his role as
President.</em></p>

<p><em>2.&nbsp; The content of his remarks seems entirely unobjectionable and probably true.</em></p>

<p><em>3. The behavior of those who walked out or condemned him is truly
regrettable and I am disappointed that it has not sparked more comment.</em></p>

<p><em>I agree with #2 and #3 entirely, and #1 in part. The President of
Harvard needs to mind his manners and to make sure that he speaks in
ways that are less likely, rather than more likely, to lead to
pernicious misinterpretation. But this should be a matter of form, not
substance. It should not be inconsistent with the function of a
university president to make true statements on important issues.</em></p></blockquote><p>True statements?&nbsp; Entirely unobjectionable?&nbsp; Let's review what Summers said, based on the Boston Globe <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2005/01/17/summers_remarks_on_women_draw_fire?mode=PF">article</a> that initially publicized his words:</p><blockquote><p><em>Summers spoke during a working lunch. He declined to provide a tape
or transcript of his remarks, but the description he gave in an
interview was generally in keeping with what 10 participants recalled.
He said he was synthesizing the scholarship that the organizers had
asked him to discuss, and that in his talk he repeated several times:
''I'm going to provoke you.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>He offered three possible explanations, in declining order of
importance, for the small number of women in high-level positions in
science and engineering. The first was the reluctance or inability of
women who have children to work 80-hour weeks.</em></p>
<p><em>The second point was that fewer girls than boys have top scores on
science and math tests in late high school years. ''I said no one
really understands why this is, and it's an area of ferment in social
science,&quot; Summers said in an interview Saturday. ''Research in
behavioral genetics is showing that things people previously attributed
to socialization weren't&quot; due to socialization after all.</em></p>
<p><em>This was the point that most angered some of the listeners, several
of whom said Summers said that women do not have the same ''innate
ability&quot; or ''natural ability&quot; as men in some fields.</em></p>
<p><em>Asked about this, Summers said, ''It's possible I made some
reference to innate differences. . . I did say that you have to be
careful in attributing things to socialization. . . That's what we
would prefer to believe, but these are things that need to be studied.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Summers said cutting-edge research has shown that genetics are more
important than previously thought, compared with environment or
upbringing. As an example, he mentioned autism, once believed to be a
result of parenting but now widely seen to have a genetic basis.</em></p>
<p><em>In his talk, according to several participants, Summers also used as
an example one of his daughters, who as a child was given two trucks in
an effort at gender-neutral parenting. Yet she treated them almost like
dolls, naming one of them ''daddy truck,&quot; and one ''baby truck.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>Summers' third point was about discrimination. Referencing a
well-known concept in economics, he said that if discrimination was the
main factor limiting the advancement of women in science and
engineering, then a school that does not discriminate would gain an
advantage by hiring away the top women who were discriminated against
elsewhere.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>Because that doesn't seem to be a widespread phenomenon, Summers
said, ''the real issue is the overall size of the pool, and it's less
clear how much the size of the pool was held down by discrimination.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Summers ended his talk by describing some of the efforts Harvard is
making to improve its hiring record and help women balance work and
family.</em></p>

<p><em>''I believe that it's an important part of what I do to encourage
frank scientific discussion,&quot; he said. ''I would hope and trust that no
one could [doubt] that we are absolutely committed to promoting the
diversity of the faculty.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>So Summers, using only theoretical economic hand-waving, essentially dismisses discrimination completely.&nbsp; His argument, as related here, neglects all the factors that contribute to advancement that are outside the control of the individual and the institution that hired her.&nbsp; Advancement in science requires not just an employer, but collaboration opportunities, published papers, and funded grant proposals.&nbsp; Summers' hypothetical non-discriminatory school could not obtain any advantage by hiring talented women shunned at leading institutions if the women continued to be shunned by the leaders in their field.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Summers then fills the vacuum that his dismissal of discrimination creates by elevating some alleged innate female inferiority.&nbsp; That such sexist arguments can still be put forward by supposedly serious people like Summers, and accepted as &quot;entirely unobjectionable&quot; by other supposedly serious people like Kleiman, shows how far the fight against gender discrimination has yet to go.&nbsp; Someone making similar suggestions that racial disparities might be due to inferiority of certain races would, and should, lose professional respect and likely their job (unless they work for a conservative <a href="http://www.aei.org/scholars/scholarID.43,filter.all/scholar.asp">think tank</a>, of course).</p>

<p>Alas, Kleiman takes his argument further into the depths:</p><blockquote><p><em>That invidious gender bias and skewed social arrangements exist it
would be hard to doubt without deliberately closing one's eyes and
ears. But that those problems explain most of the underrepresentation
of women among tenured scientists and mathematicians is open to doubt.</em></p>

<p><em>Matt [Yglesias, blogger and journalist] misstates the evidence about the relative skills of the two
sexes in a subtle but important way. What matters isn't the difference
in central tendencies between the two distributions, but rather their
dispersion around that central tendency.</em></p>

<p><em>For excellent evolutionary reasons, human males display higher
variance than human females on many important traits, including
measures of mental capacity. That means that they are likely to
predominate among the top one hundredth of one percent of almost any
cognitive talent, unless women are on average much better endowed in
that particular department. </em></p>

<p><em>So it wouldn't be surprising to find that women, on average, write
better than men do, but that there are more men than women among the
handful of the very best writers in the world</em>.</p></blockquote><p>I'll skip over the supreme, albeit typical in academics, arrogance that is evident in Kleiman's implicit assumption that academic positions are reserved for the &quot;top hundredth of one percent.&quot;&nbsp; But with this argument, Kleiman appears to excuse male domination of every skilled field into eternity.</p>

<p>Exhibit A in the academic glass ceiling:&nbsp; Larry Summers.</p>

<p>Exhibit B:&nbsp; Mark Kleiman.</p>

<p>Exhibit C:&nbsp; Far too many other men.</p>

<p>It would be nice to see some evidence that these men have ever listened to a significant number—or even any—academic or other professional women about their experiences in building their careers.&nbsp; I know a few who might be able to educate them.<br /> </p><blockquote></blockquote>

<p><a title="Pharyngula::Some MAN needs to calculate the rotational velocity of MLK’s corpse, immediately!" href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/some_man_needs_to_calculate_the_rotation_velocity_of_mlks_corpse_immediatel/">Pharyngula</a>, who appears to be a male scientist at a university in Minnesota:</p><blockquote><p><em>I’ll tell you how much of a role discrimination plays in limiting

like Summers standing guard over the gateways.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://bitchphd.blogspot.com/2005/01/newsflash-lawrence-summers-is-dick.html">Bitch, Ph.D.</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Having said that his hypothesis is &quot;based on . . . scholarly work,&quot;

<p><em>And I have to say, I don’t buy Summers’ attempt to spin his comments

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Lawrence Summers, the president of Harvard University, has apparently ignited quite a firestorm about why women are so severely underrepresented in science and engineering academic positions.&nbsp; Here is a brief summary of what he said, according to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/19/education/19harvard.html?incamp=article_popular_4">New York Times</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em> At Friday's conference, Mr. Summers discussed possible reasons so
few women were on the science and engineering faculties at research
universities, and he said he would be provocative. </em></p>

<p><em>Among his hypotheses were that faculty positions at elite
universities required more time and energy than married women with
children were willing to accept, that innate sex differences might
leave women less capable of succeeding at the most advanced mathematics
and that discrimination may also play a role, participants said. There
was no transcript of his remarks.</em></p>

<p><em> His remarks caused one professor to walk out and another to openly challenge them.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Summers has apparently moved into damage control mode:</p><blockquote><p><em>At the center of the storm, Mr. Summers posted a statement late
Monday night on his Web page, saying that his comments at the National
Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit economic research organization
in Cambridge had been misconstrued and pledging to continue efforts to
&quot;attract and engage outstanding women scientists.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em> &quot;My aim at the conference was to underscore that the situation is
likely the product of a variety of factors and that further research
can help us better understand their interplay,&quot; he said. &quot;I do not
presume to have confident answers, only the conviction that the harder
we work to research and understand the situation, the better the
prospects for long term success.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Alas, there is no transcript available, so I don't know exactly what he said, but based on this reporting, I wonder whether Summers has ever seriously talked to female university scientists and engineers about their workplace experiences.&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote><p><em> Maud Lavin, who graduated from Harvard in the class of 1976, was
one of the first women to take a demanding theoretical math sequence,
Math 11 and Math 55, and is an associate professor at the School of the
Art Institute of Chicago. Ms Lavin said in an interview yesterday that
she would not donate any more money to Harvard as long as Mr. Summers
was president, after firing off an angry e-mail message to him.</em></p>

<p><em> &quot;I am offended and furious about your remarks on women in science
and mathematics,&quot; Ms. Lavin wrote. &quot;Arguments of innate gender
difference in math are hogwash and indirectly serve to feed the
virulent prejudices still alas very alive and now even more so due to
your ill-informed remarks.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Sadly, Summers' dismissive attitude toward gender discrimination is
still extremely common among men, even those who should know better. 
Fortunately, his eagerness to explain away discrimination by appealing
to notions of female inferiority is much rarer these days.&nbsp; Well, at
least voicing such an opinion is rare.</p>

<p>But perhaps some good will come out of all this:</p><blockquote><p><em> On and off the campus, Mr. Summers's remarks were the subject of heated debate yesterday. </em></p>

<p><em>Denice D. Denton, the dean of engineering at the University of
Washington who confronted Mr. Summers over his remarks at the
conference, said that her phone had not stopped ringing and that she
had received scores of e-mail messages on the subject. She said Mr.
Summers's remarks might have put new energy into a longstanding effort
to improve the status of women in the sciences. </em></p>

<p><em>&quot;I think they've provoked an intellectual tsunami,&quot; Dr. Denton said.</em> </p></blockquote><p>Enough of one to wake huge numbers of men up from both their patronizing attitude towards women and from their ignorance of the existence and affects of gender discrimination?&nbsp; I sure hope so.

                                <p>Never let anyone tell you that gender discrimination is ancient history.&nbsp; Look what the huge corporation Viacom just got caught doing.&nbsp; According to the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A5872-2004Dec16?language=printer">Washington Post</a> (scroll down):</p><blockquote>

<p><em>Job Alert! There's an excellent job opportunity at media giant Viacom International Inc., which owns CBS among other things, judging from an e-mail we just got from Gail MacKinnon, Viacom vice president for government relations.<br /><br />MacKinnon sent the note Tuesday to House Republican offices and to the offices of GOP Sens. John Ensign (Nev.), Gordon Smith (Ore.) and George Allen (Va.).<br /><br />&quot;Subject: Looking to fill a position in our office<br /></em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Importance: High We need to hire a junior lobbyist/PAC manager. Attached is a job description. Salary is $85-90K. Must be a male with Republican stripes.<br /><br />&quot;If you know of anyone who might be interested in interviewing for this position, would you please let me know? Thanks so much. Hope everyone has a wonderful holiday.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Oddly, the Washington Post writer, Al Kamen, only seems to find this noteworthy due to the phrase &quot;Republican stripes.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Anyway, the <a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/activities/20041217/">Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington</a> (CREW), <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_12_12.php#004260">Josh Marshall</a>, and Ezra Klein at <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/004251.html">Pandagon</a> note the seedier aspect of this brief note.&nbsp; What is particularly shocking is that Viacom apparently sent this note, as is, not just to Republican politicans, but directly to the media.&nbsp; I thought corporations had learned to be a lot more subtle about stuff like this over the years.</p>

<p>From CREW:</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;This is a blatant violation of federal law prohibiting discrimination
against women in hiring,&quot; Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW
said today. &quot;It is stunning that one of the largest corporations in
America is so comfortable violating this 40 year-old prohibition that
it has openly sent an e-mail advertising its discriminatory hiring
practices to the very body that passed the anti-discrimination laws in
the first place. One cannot help but be concerned that Viacom may have
a practice of discriminating against women. As a result, CREW calls
upon both Congress and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to
begin immediate investigations in into Viacom's hiring practices.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Let's see what happens.</p>
