		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Emotions appear to be running high in the final days of the Helotes city council campaign.&nbsp; As I wrote about a few days ago, these <a href="../../../2007/05/forces_promotin.html">elections</a> pit three one-term, sensible-growth, incumbents, against developer-funded opponents, who appear to be aiming to take back the small town in the name of sprawl -- sprawl that is engulfing much of the Hill Country on the outskirts of San Antonio.</p>

<p>Another sign dispute has erupted, as reported by the Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/neighbors/northwest/stories/MYSA050907.1H.NW.signs.20bc984.html">yesterday</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Two informational neighborhood signs at the Cedar Springs subdivision have been at the center of several past disputes and recently sparked another controversy. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Around April 27, the signs just inside the subdivision's entrance and exit gates displayed messages that city officials said are in violation of a city ordinance and also could jeopardize the nonprofit status of the Cedar Springs Homeowners Association. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">One read: &quot;Green party respect CS private property ask B4 placing your election signs.&quot; The other said: &quot;Helotes taxes going up 24 percent do U care.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The term &quot;green party&quot; refers to the color of the signs for City Council incumbents — Mayor Jon Allan, Place 3 Councilwoman Linda Boyer-Owens and Place 5 Councilman Stuart Birnbaum, who are seeking re-election May 12. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Allan said the statement about the tax increase is inaccurate and appears to be in reference to information from campaign literature of the challengers: Tom Schoolcraft is running for mayor; Jeff Ellis for Place 3; and Rich Whitehead for Place 5. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">A city ordinance that governs signs like those in the 501-home Cedar Springs subdivision says the purpose of &quot;residential subdivision changeable copy signs for gated communities&quot; is to &quot;provide non-commercial and non-political information related to the residential subdivision.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;Regardless of the specifics of what the signs say, they can't have any political information of any kind on them,&quot; Allan said. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">But the HOA board members, who said they were responsible for posting the copy, disagree. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;We do not see the information as political, but rather as fact and for the information of the community,&quot; said Mike Taylor, board treasurer. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Board president Lorraine Shattuck agreed but would not comment further. Allan said he called Shattuck twice and left messages to try to resolve the issue, but his calls were not returned.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The evidence for the heated emotions comes in an anecdote related later in this article:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">A Helotes Police Department report about the April 28 event at the corner of Cedar Point and Hausman Road indicates that Helotes residents John Eakin and Linda Montemayor were involved. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">According to the report, Eakin was campaigning for the incumbents when Montemayor was driving into the neighborhood and an exchange occurred. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I was trying to go into the neighborhood and John was walking toward me with fliers. ... I shook my head and he kept coming and I told him that 'I would not vote for y'all if my life depended on it,'&quot; Montemayor said. &quot;He then told me 'We don't want your white trash votes anyway,' and I called the police.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Eakin admits that he was there and was asked to leave by Apodaca [vice president of the homeowners association], but he denies making the comment to Montemayor. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;The police did come and make me sign a document about trespassing, and I did speak with Linda, but I did not saying anything like that to her. She was screaming obscenities,&quot; he said.</span> </p></blockquote></blockquote><p>This particular homeowners association may be advertising political slogans attacking the sensible-growth incumbent councilmembers, but the homeowners who live there are far from unanimous in this feeling.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The article quotes resident Bill Hollis, &quot;There is no other way to label these people [the homeowners' association board] except as a rogue board, and with them, anything goes. ...&nbsp; When you file as a nonprofit organization with the state and become tax-exempt, you can't be political in any way. Those signs are clearly political and we could lose our nonprofit status, but it is not the first time they have violated nonpolitical rules.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Resident Edie Lopez is quoted also, saying, &quot;Anyone who has knowledge of organizations like this that are nonprofit knows that you don't do certain things, especially political things, and this is not something the entire neighborhood agrees with.&quot;</p>

<p>Living a few miles down the road in unincorporated Bexar County, just outside the San Antonio city limits, I have unfortunately no say in this election, or, for that matter, in any of the San Antonio city council elections next week.&nbsp; So I am envious of the residents of Helotes.&nbsp; They have an opportunity to stand up (once again) to the immense wealth of the real estate developers pushing for unrestrained development of the land and neighborhoods we love.&nbsp; My only voice is in the state legislature, which is tightly controlled by these forces, with any glimmer of wresting that control away far off.</p>

<p>I hope that the residents of Helotes make the same decision that they made two years ago, when they voted in Mayor Jon Allan and councilmembers Linda Boyer-Owens and Stuart Hirshbaum, and voted out uncontrolled sprawl.</p>

<p>Here are some words from Allan, Boyer-Owens, and Hirshbaum on their platform, as quoted in the <a href="http://blogs.mysanantonio.com/weblogs/nbrnw/2007/04/amanda_reimherr_more_comments.html">Express-News</a> on April 25:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Allan:&nbsp; <span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I see the big issue is how do we deal with development. We have now required developers to build sidewalks and boosted the tree ordinance. It makes sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;What I tried to do the last couple of years is protect the open spaces and realistically come up with a plan so that as development comes in, we are setting aside parks and open space, and saving more trees. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;We have implemented a dark sky ordinance to preserve it from light pollution and we are undergoing a big planning process to deal with how we will sustain development.&quot;</span></p>

<p>Boyer-Owens:&nbsp; <span style="color: #003300;">&quot;The issues are still much like they were when I ran two years ago. The press of urban sprawl and trying to maintain the Helotes the town we love to live in. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;If reelected, we really want to finish the job we started. We had a lot to clean up in our first two years, and now we need to move forward. We have the new master plan/comprehensive planning process started, and I think it will lay down the consensus of the community about what Helotes wants for the future. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;We want to pursue becoming home rule, that takes a lot of work and lots of citizen input and I want to see an effort to cultivate and recruit the type of businesses and services that Helotians want. The claims of depleting the reserve fund aren´t true.&quot;</span></p>

<p>Hirshbaum:&nbsp; <span style="color: #003300;">&quot;Parks and open space is important issue, we can either have rampant development and clear cutting or we can try to protect some portion of this as green space for citizens to use. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I think we can do this without using tax money and without undue financial burden on the citizens. I don't think the city can really consider itself a proper community without having some park space for its citizens to use. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;Quality of life issues are important, and parks and playgrounds for children are the major concerns that I have and reasons I have decided to run again. I think that the current mayor and council are making great strides in that direction and another two years would help move us along.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Final voting is Saturday, May 12.&nbsp; Last time, Allan and his two allies won by a literal handful of votes.&nbsp; The cliche is accurate in this case:&nbsp; every vote counts.&nbsp; </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Two years ago, a battle over the development of a Super Wal-Mart divided the small town of Helotes, on the outskirts of San Antonio's sprawling suburbs and a gateway to the Hill Country.&nbsp; The municipal elections ended up with the anti-Wal-Mart forces, led by mayoral candidate Jon Allan, ekeing out a <a href="../../../2005/05/victory_of_walm.html">victory</a> by a handful of votes, ousting three council incumbents who had supported the Wal-Mart development.</p>

<p>Within months, Wal-Mart had <a href="../../../2005/12/its_official_no.html">given up</a> on their plans in Helotes.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Now, election season has returned, the <a href="../../../2007/03/helotes_much_fi.html">Great Helotes Mulch Fire</a> has come and gone, and, while Wal-Mart has left, the forces promoting the continued tearing up and paving over of the countryside have decidedly not.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA050307.03B.helotes.campaign.contrib.33e77a5.html">Express-News</a> reported yesterday (via <a href="http://digdeepertexas.com/?p=416">Dig Deeper Texas</a>):</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">The amount of money contributed this year to municipal election campaigns here is markedly higher than in previous years, due in part to $10,000 in contributions made by an area developer. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">On March 19, Alfred &quot;Tom&quot; Rohde gave a total of $10,000 to three candidates who are running against three City Council incumbents. Tom Schoolcraft is challenging Mayor Jon Allan, Jeff Ellis is running against Place 3 Councilwoman Linda Boyer-Owens and Rich Whitehead is seeking to unseat Place 5 Councilman Stuart Birnbaum.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Rohde contributed $4,000 to Schoolcraft's campaign and gave $3,000 each to Ellis and Whitehead. Their most recent contribution reports indicate Schoolcraft received a total of $5,460.28, while Ellis and Whitehead each received a total of $3,355.14. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I felt it was time for a change,&quot; Rohde said when asked about his contributions. He added he won't contribute any more money to the races. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Unlike San Antonio, Helotes does not have ordinances governing the amount of money that can be contributed. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I have looked at records, (and) numbers like this are unheard of,&quot; Allan said. &quot;In past elections, (Helotes) candidates have usually not received more than $1,000, total.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The proponents of uncontrolled development also apparently are not letting <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA050207.08B.helotes.campaign.signs.34feb5f.html">city law</a> get in the way of their expressions of support, as the Express-News reported a couple days ago:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">A couple of unconventional campaign signs may cause hefty fines for the owners of the property where they are displayed. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The electronic signs, resembling those used to announce traffic hazards, display political advertisements for the candidates challenging three City Council incumbents, including Mayor Jon Allan.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;The signs are in violation of the Section 66-117 of the city's sign ordinance that governs political signs,&quot; said City Attorney Habib Erkan. &quot;They are too big, too high and they are lit internally — none of which is allowed for political signs, according to the ordinance.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The signs are causing tension in an already heated election season, officials said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The signs flash advertisements for Tom Schoolcraft, Jeff Ellis and Rich Whitehead. Schoolcraft is challenging Allan, Ellis faces Place 3 Councilwoman Linda Boyer-Owens and Whitehead faces Place 5 Councilman Stuart Birnbaum. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Schoolcraft said he was unaware of any potential violation when the signs went up. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I understand the city is contacting the landowners, but I have not heard anything or received anything in writing. It is up to the landowners to decide what they will do,&quot; he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">One of the signs is at FM 1560 and Bandera Road on the property of Daryl Zumwalt, and the other is off Bandera Road on a tract owned by REOC Partners Ltd. Representatives for both said they had no comment.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Zumwalt.&nbsp; That name sounded familiar to me.&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, yes, that huge mulch pile--a result of the uncontrolled development in the surrounding area--that made such a big stink so recently was on land owned by a fellow named <a href="../../../2007/02/end_within_sigh.html">Henry L. Zumwalt</a>, not far from where that illegal political sign is now.</p>

<p>What further surprises do the Zumwalts and developer Rohde have in store for Helotes?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>No matter how early it may seem, it's Presidential campaign season, and that means Bob Somerby's <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/">Daily Howler</a> has once again returned to the top of my must-read list. No one else is as determined to cut through the media misinformation.</p>

<p>His latest efforts have been centered on attacks—primarily by other Democrats—on Senator and candidate for President Hillary Clinton. The attacks, including the latest by the usually excellent New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, suggest that Senator Clinton has not admitted to making a mistake by voting in late 2002 to authorize George W. Bush to use force in Iraq.</p>

<p>Somerby <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh021907.shtml">wrote</a> yesterday (emphasis his):</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">According to Krugman, Clinton has refused to “own up” to her “mistake” in casting that 10/02 vote. His argument will surely affect many readers. But here’s the problem: Krugman never lets readers decide for themselves whether Clinton has really owned up to her error. He never quotes a single thing Clinton has actually said on this subject. Krugman keeps readers barefoot and clueless. They hear his account of what Clinton has said. They don’t hear her actual statements.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Has Clinton “owned up” to her “mistake?” Has she “admit[ted] past error?” For ourselves, we think it’s odd that Clinton won’t use the specific word “mistake” in describing her 10/02 vote. But in our judgment, she has owned up to her mistake—in fact, she did so long ago. Other readers might agree with that assessment—if Krugman would have the decency to tell them what Clinton has actually said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The history: Clinton cast that awful vote in October 2002. (So did Kerry. So did Edwards.) But omigod! As early as August 2004, she had clearly rethought the vote. On August 29, she appeared on Meet the Press (where she staunchly defended Kerry and Edwards). Here’s part of what she said—well over two years ago:</span></p><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">RUSSERT (8/29/04): Jay Rockefeller, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was on this program a few weeks ago and this is what he said: &quot;...We in Congress would not have authorized that war—we would not have authorized that war—with 75 votes if we knew what we know now.&quot; Do you agree with him?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">CLINTON: <strong>There would not have</strong> been a vote, Tim. There would never have been a vote to the Congress presented by the administration. <strong>There would have been no basis for it.</strong></span></p></blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">All the way back in 8/04, Clinton said there would have been “no basis” for that vote if we’d known there were no WMD. There wouldn’t even have been a vote, she told Russert (also Wolf Blitzer). Since then, she’s continued making that statement, even spelling things out for the very slow by adding the obvious corollary—she herself would have voted “no” if she’d known there were no WMD. Do you mind if we make a simple statement? In our view, Clinton <em>did</em> “say that she was wrong to vote for the Iraq war resolution” when she made that statement to Russert. (When she said <em>she’d have voted the other way</em> if she knew about the WMD.)</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>This whole pseudo-controversy is ludicrous—perhaps even more so as it is being ginned up by Democrats rather than the typical Republican noise machine. Clinton has admitted error on her 2002 vote and has promised to end the war if she is elected. What more needs to be said?</p>

<p>Yet we have Krugman insinuating that she may possibly as pig-headedly stubborn as Bush, and we have <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2007/2/17/213744/100">Markos Moulitsas</a> of Daily Kos seconding that and proclaiming that she has already lost any hope of his support because she won't say the precise phrase &quot;I made a mistake.&quot;&nbsp; Plenty of other bloggers inherently suspicious of Senator Clinton are joining in.&nbsp; They appear unaware that Clinton has been admitting to being incorrect on the Iraq war vote for a year-and-a-half—far longer than John Edwards, who escapes their wrath, has been doing so.</p>

<p>This is insane. If we're going to attack each other, let it at least be over something accurate.</p>

<p>Now, some local Republicans are already thinking about being the one to take him on next time.&nbsp; From Sunday's <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA021807.01B.Larson.11be96e.html">Express-News</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">County Commissioner Lyle Larson said Friday he's seriously considering running in Congressional District 23 in 2008 — a clear sign that the aftershocks of last summer's court-ordered redistricting didn't end with Democrat Ciro Rodriguez's upset of Republican Henry Bonilla. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Despite Rodriguez's eight percentage point victory, Larson contends the district — which stretches from San Antonio to El Paso — remains winnable for the GOP, especially with the concentration of votes in his North Side stronghold. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;It looks like it's still a Republican district if you get the vote out,&quot; said Larson, the lone Republican on the Commissioners Court. &quot;This is one that was lost that never should've been lost to the Democratic Party.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Richard Langlois, chairman of the Bexar County Republican Party, blamed the rout [Rodriguez's victory over Henry Bonilla in December] on GOP voters who stayed at home. He also said they'd likely turn out in droves in 2008 to oust Rodriguez.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr">This district is certainly competitive for the GOP if the right Republican joined the race.&nbsp; I doubt Larson is that person.&nbsp; He represents the highly Republican northwest part of Bexar County, Bonilla's old stronghold, and is far less well known.&nbsp; (For example, I have lived in this area for seven years and know essentially nothing about Larson.)&nbsp; As Larson is an anglo Republican from the wealthy part of town, I find it extremely doubtful he could gain&nbsp; significant support in heavily-Latino, economically disadvantaged, south Bexar County.&nbsp; And Bonilla, as a long-term incumbent, had many advantages that Larson, or another Republican, will not have in 2008.&nbsp; So, it is unlikely he could do much better than Bonilla could against Ciro Rodriguez, no matter how much northwest Bexar County GOPers would like to oust Rodriguez.&nbsp; </p>

<p dir="ltr">Still, we should not assume this district is a sure thing for Democrats in 2008.&nbsp; That attitude, on the part of the GOP, is what helped to spell Bonilla's demise last year.&nbsp; Fortunately, the DCCC has shown that they, at least, are not going to make that same mistake.&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The latest on the action (or inaction) on state parks in the Texas legislature:</p>

<ul><li>Last week, House Speaker <a href="http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/16595661.htm">Tom Craddick</a> expressed his support for fully funding the parks system via the entire amount of the sales tax on sporting goods (via <a href="http://capitolannex.com/2007/02/01/80th-legislature-craddick-announces-unequivocal-support-for-full-funding-for-state-parks/">Capitol Annex</a> and <a href="http://eyeonwilliamson.org/?p=841">Eye on Williamson</a>). This did not come as a surprise, since, as I wrote about <a href="../../../2007/01/state_parks_bil.html">earlier</a>, six of the seven people Craddick assigned to the committee considering the bill that accomplishes this are co-authors—and the chair, Harvey Hilderbran of Kerrville, is the primary author.</li>

<li>Meanwhile, Hilderbran's bill to fully fund state parks, HB6, is up to <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Authors.aspx?LegSess=80R&amp;Bill=HB6">104</a> co-authors, including 52 Republicans and 52 Democrats. After Democrat Ruth McClendon of San Antonio signed on today, the only central Texas representatives missing are Dems Robert Puente of San Antonio (southeastern Bexar County) and Mark Strama of Austin (northeastern Travis County).</li>

<li>Despite the overwhelming support for parks in the Texas House, the leader of the Texas Senate, GOP Lieutanant Governor David Dewhurst, following in the footsteps of Governor Rick Perry, has expressed reservations about fully funding our parks, saying an extra $25 million is all they can handle. Parks director Walt Dabney, via the outdoors columnist of the <a href="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/outdoors/02/04/4legcol.html">Austin American-Statesman</a>, strongly disagrees: <blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;If that's all the money that's coming,&quot; Dabney said, referring to the $25 million figure, &quot;we can fix some things but we can't run it. It makes no sense to fix something but not take care of it.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Dabney laid out the department's legislative request for annual money above the current $56 million parks budget that would be needed to get the system back to a competitive level with other states:</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">•$23 million for full- and part-time staff, operating expenses and equipment replacement.<br />•$2 million to add staff to plan for road and building repair and replacement.<br />•$25 million to restore historical sites and parks that have been allowed to decline because of a lack of funding. There is a $400 million backlog of identified repairs and restoration projects, Dabney said.<br />•$7 million to add acreage and facilities to existing state parks. Many parks need group shelter sites and new bathrooms, as well as adjacent available acreage that would make them more usable and attract more visitors. &quot;Those things would expand the season for those parks and increase the money those parks bring in,&quot; Dabney said.<br />•$8 million to add four new parks, which have been called for in the department's strategic plan. Those parks are to be acquired and developed close to the state's largest metropolitan centers.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The department is seeking another $20 million in local parks funding. That appropriation has been decimated in recent sessions and currently stands at $5.5 million. Raising it back above $20 million per year would be a real boost to local parks construction and development, Dabney said.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote></li></ul>

<p>How long will Gov. Perry and Lt. Gov. Dewhurst continue to resist restoring Texas parks to their full potential?</p>

<p>UPDATE (10:49 P.M.):&nbsp; Is Perry finally on board?&nbsp; It appears his <a href="http://www.governor.state.tx.us/divisions/press/pressreleases/PressRelease.2007-02-05.1500">list</a> of &quot;emergency legislation&quot; that the legislature can consider early in the session includes the parks funding bill (via <a href="http://www.dfw.com/mld/startelegram/news/state/16629404.htm">AP</a> and Matt Glazer at <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=2840">Burnt Orange Report</a>).</p>

                                <p>While our newly-elected congressman Ciro Rodriguez is busy both in <a href="http://www.swtexaslive.com/node/3027">D.C.</a> and in our expansive district (last weekend he was at a community forum in <a href="http://www.elpasotimes.com/election/ci_5103824">El Paso</a>), the fellow that Rodriguez defeated may be getting a new gig soon.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA012507.bushbonilla.EN.1c544e95.html">Express-News</a> reported on January 25:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">Bush administration officials are eyeing former Rep. Henry Bonilla as a possible envoy to the Organization of American States, sources said Thursday.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Bonilla has met with Karl Rove, a senior advisor to Bush, about the post of U.S. permanent representative to the OAS, considered an ambassadorship to the organization that promotes democracy in the Western Hemisphere, a source close to the congressman said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Reached by telephone in San Antonio, Bonilla would not confirm or deny interest in the OAS position, or whether he was in talks with the Bush administration about a position within the administration.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">“I can only say there is nothing official that has been offered,” Bonilla said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The OAS brings together nations of the Western Hemisphere to work on common interest. </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>These are scary times, knowing that the man currently residing in the oval office feels cornered — desperate in his refusal to change the course he set us on four years ago.&nbsp; Will we let him drag the country, the world, down with him?</p>

<p>From former Senator, current Presidential candidate, <a href="http://blog.johnedwards.com/story/2007/1/15/10479/0499">John Edwards</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Almost 40 years ago the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stood at the pulpit in Riverside Church and, with the full force of his conscience, denounced the war in Vietnam -- calling it a &quot;tragedy that threatened to drag our nation down to dust.&quot;<br /><br />As Dr. King put it then, there comes a time when silence is a betrayal -- not only of one's personal convictions, or even of one's country alone, but also of our deeper obligations to humanity.<br /><br /><strong>Today, another president is trying to escalate another war. And once again, silence is betrayal.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Congress can stop Bush's escalation, but they'll only do so if the people demand it.</strong> That's why today -- in honor of the memory and courage of Martin Luther King -- I'm asking you to do two things:</span></p>

<ol><li><a href="http://johnedwards.com/r/5160/797417" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Join nearly 50,000 other Americans who have signed the petition calling on Congress to block funding for escalating the war in Iraq</span></strong></a><span style="color: #003300;">. </span></li>

<li><span style="color: #003300;">Tomorrow, when Congress returns to session, call your Senators directly and tell them to block funding for escalation. </span><a href="http://johnedwards.com/r/5161/797417" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Click here for your Senators' contact information</span></strong></a><span style="color: #003300;">. </span></li></ol>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Let's be clear: This is not a time for symbolic speech and hand-wringing from Washington. Congress has a very real choice to make -- either they fund Bush's escalation and he risks more American lives, or they don't, and we start to bring this war to a close.<br /><br />Every member of Congress is responsible for that choice -- if they know this war is going in the wrong direction and that escalation is wrong, it is no longer enough for them to study their options and keep their own counsel.<br /><br />But the ultimate responsibility for our country does not lie in Washington -- it lies with us. All of us who believe that Bush's plan to escalate the war is wrong for America, for Iraq, and for the world, must do more than hope for action in Washington -- we must take responsibility and act ourselves.<br /><br /><strong>Your urgent calls will help push the Senate to hold a vote on funding Bush's escalation</strong>, and we'll deliver your signatures to Congress to help ensure they cast the right vote when the time comes.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">George W. Bush has made it arrogantly clear he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/14/AR2007011401027.html">plans to do</a> whatever he feels like doing, no matter what Congress or the people of this country say and think.&nbsp; But we still have to do what we can to stop him from making further mistakes with so many lives at stake.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">While, I'm using a message from a Democratic Presidential candidate to help make this point, this should not be a partisan issue.&nbsp; Plenty of Republicans, including numerous Republican Senators, such as Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, also believe that Bush's course is a dreadful mistake.&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Alas, Tom Craddick retained his position as Texas speaker on Tuesday over his fellow Republican, Jim Pitts -- with the support of 15 Democrats in addition to all but a dozen or so Republicans. </p>

<p>I believe it was a <a href="../../../2007/01/pitts_r_v_cradd.html">mistake</a> for progressives to try to turn the choice of Pitts (and <a href="../../../2006/12/power_struggle_.html">earlier</a>, Republican Brian McCall) into a litmus test for Democratic legislators, an effort which many of my fellow Texas political bloggers drove. In fact, this effort may have contributed to Pitts' defeat, as it likely helped make Republican legislators wary of publicly joining the Pitts forces. These GOPers may have feared a primary challenge funded by Craddick allies, but such a challenge would have been more likely to succeed due to the vocally Democratic nature of the McCall/Pitts coalition.</p>

<p>Texas Monthly's <a href="http://www.texasmonthly.com/community/blog/paulburka/2007/01/just-wondering.php">Paul Burka</a> summarized this point on Thursday:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">The fatal flaw of the McCall/Pitts challenge to Tom Craddick was that it was based on Democrats. The theory was that with most of the Democrats and fourth to a third of the Republicans, a challenge to Craddick would be successful. The problem was that the more successful they were in recruiting Democrats, the harder it became to atract Republicans beyond the dozen or so ABCs [Anyone-But-Craddick]. </span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>If the situation were reversed, Dem activists could understand why Dem legislators would be very hesitant to join up with a coalition dominated by Republicans in ousting their incumbent Dem Speaker. In fact, in such a situation, these activists would likely be driving primary challenges to any Dem legislators who joined such a Republican-dominated coalition.</p>

<p>So now, as progressive activists and bloggers consider <a href="http://burntorangereport.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=2679">fueling</a> primary challenges against the 15 Craddick Dems (another mistake at this point, in my opinion), the irony is that if there had been <em>more</em> Craddick Dems, Craddick may well have lost his position.</p>

                                <p>A water fight is brewing over the Edwards Aquifer. More accurately, this fight has been brewing for many years, but is set to flare up in this legislative session. The San Antonio Express News' Carlos Guerra has written a series of excellent columns on this over the last couple weeks.</p>

<p>January 4: <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/cguerra/stories/MYSA010407.01B.guerra.32fd89b.html">Latest aquifer pumping skirmish could lead to a major water war</a></p>

<p>January 5: <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/cguerra/stories/MYSA010607.01B.guerra.2dba052.html">Worrying about water shortage while threatening source is absurd</a></p>

<p>January 10: <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/cguerra/stories/MYSA011107.01B.Guerra.2e785c2.html">Would setting higher pumping cap on Edwards hurt conservation?</a></p>

<p>This series is inspired by a proposal by GOP state Senator Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio to officially raise the cap on the amount of water that can be pumped out of the Edwards aquifer by &quot;a whopping&quot; 22%, making it consistent with the amount of pumping permits that the Edwards Aquifer Authority (EAA) was required to issue based on historical use. The EAA accounted for the difference between the cap and the actual amount of pumping permitted by declaring some of the permits &quot;junior&quot; to the others and requiring those pumping rights to be suspended during times of shortage. Apparently, an Attorney General's opinion earlier this week may invalidate this two-tiered system of permits.</p>

<p>The cap is set where it is for a good reason -- because pumping more water lowers the level of the Edwards below the point where several prodigious springs in central Texas, such as San Marcos springs, flow significantly. This results in a shortage of water downstream. So while we hear a lot about how drying up the springs will hurt certain endangered species and harm ecosystems along the rivers, what this really boils down to is a fight with San Antonio Water System (SAWS) and Hill Country real estate developers on one side and downstream users on the other side.</p>

<p>Guerra quotes Dianne Wassenich of the San Marcos River Foundation in the January 5 article:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">Yes, this water is very important to us in Central Texas who use it as groundwater. But it is also very important to cities that have springs and rivers that flow through them, and to communities and ranchers all the way down to the coast. And at the coast, you have wildlife, ecotourism and the fishing industry.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Guerra also notes that the massive development boom on the land which feeds the Edwards aquifer is threatening the quality of this water in dispute.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;It's crazy,&quot; Wassenich says. &quot;Here we are, destroying the very recharge zone through which water of good quality, in good quantity, is flowing into the aquifer. &quot;We're destroying that very capability while we're worrying about not having enough water. It just doesn't make any sense.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>For more background, see my 2005 post on <a href="../../../2005/04/edwards_aquifer.html">Edwards aquifer politics</a> and Gregg Eckhardt's comprehensive <a href="http://www.edwardsaquifer.net/">edwardsaquifer.net</a> website.

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The power struggle for the position of Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives will be decided tomorrow, when the next session of the Texas legislature opens in Austin. It is now down to a choice between the incumbent speaker Tom Craddick of Midland and fellow Republican Jim Pitts of Waxahachie.</p>

<p>On some <a href="http://www.mcblogger.com/archives/2007/01/but_children_ar.html">progressive</a> Texas blogs, there is a sentiment to turn this GOP civil war into a Democratic civil war. One of the most explicit statements of this viewpoint was posted on <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/frontPage.do">Burnt Orange Report</a> today by Karl-Thomas Musselman: &quot;If [the 10 Democrats pledged to Craddick] follow through and vote for him tomorrow, expect primary challengers to find this footage [of them attending a dinner in support of Craddick] available to them.&quot;</p>

<p>Reading numerous like-minded comments over the last couple weeks, I was put off. This internal GOP battle should not be turned into Democratic litmus test, I thought. After all, this is a choice between two conservative Republicans, neither of whom would likely be friendly to a Democratic agenda.</p>

<p>But reading this <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4452221.html">article</a> in the Houston Chronicle, I began to have second thoughts, as I was reminded that many of the major &quot;bad guys&quot; (big, monied, special interests) in Texas politics have so much invested in Craddick as the GOP leader, that his loss, even to a fellow conservative Republican, has the potential to be major victory for the rest of us.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Yet this article also points out that some of these same big money special interests, such as real estate mogul Bob Perry, are also heavily invested in Jim Pitts.&nbsp; Given the nature of his coalition, though, a Pitts speakership seems likely to give rise to policies closer to the will of the people of this state than a Craddick one.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So it comes down to this: I would love to see Craddick go down to defeat tomorrow at the hands of Pitts. But I would advise fellow Democrats to not turn this choice between two conservative Republicans into a litmus test for Democratic politicians. Instead, judge them by how they perform for Texas citizens during the rest of this upcoming session.</p>
