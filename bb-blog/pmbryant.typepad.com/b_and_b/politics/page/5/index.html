                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Whatever difference Democrats have over the Senate primary in Connecticut between Joe Lieberman and political neophyte Ned Lamont, it is irresponsible to be passing along rumor and innuendo as if it were another other than rumor and innuendo.&nbsp; The latest attack against Lieberman is that he actively sought the Republican nomination for Senate in addition to the Democratic nomination.&nbsp; The evidence?&nbsp; Speculation by some anonymous &quot;Connecticut Democrat&quot; who apparently spoke to Time columnist Joe Klein, who, while nominally left of center, is well known for attacking Democrats.&nbsp; </p>

<p>What in the world do supposedly respectable journalist/bloggers such as <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/show_comments.mhtml?b=theplank&amp;pid=26685">Jonathan Chait</a> of The New Republic and aspiring alleged respectable journalist/blogger <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/2006/07/post_920.html">Ezra Klein</a> of The American Prospect think they are doing by passing this baseless rumor along?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Chait says this quote pulled out of thin air from who knows who is &quot;not completely implausible, but pretty hard to believe.&quot;&nbsp; Still, he wishes that &quot;more reporters dig into this,&quot; even though there is absolutely no evidence suggesting this could be true.&nbsp; Ezra Klein seems completely taken in, essentially assuming the truth of this baseless slur since it appears to fit his misguided stereotype of Lieberman's behavior, and piling on.</p>

<p>Whatever one feels about the merits of Lieberman versus Lamont, this behavior by these two journalists should be an embarrassment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have seen similar baseless smears made against Lieberman for years by misguided progressives, dating from long before the war in Iraq was even on the horizon.&nbsp; So while many of Lieberman's actions as a Senator in recent years have left a lot to be desired, and his campaign in this primary race appears to have been pathetically bad to this point, and his decision to potentially run as an independent should he lose the primary is bizarre, I remain very suspicious of the anti-Lieberman campaign.&nbsp; Especially since I have heard little to no pro-Lamont talk coming out of the anti-Lieberman camp.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Who is this Lamont guy anyway?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Just a few days after I wonder what Democratic candidate for governor Chris Bell's stance is on the <a href="../../../2006/07/gov_perry_sendi.html">crisis</a> with our state park system, Bell comes through in a big way.</p>

<p>Via <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/007660.html#007660">Off the Kuff</a>, I discovered that Bell has decided to make environmental issues a major issue in his campaign, and today put out a summary of his &quot;<a href="http://www.chrisbell.com/issues/environment">Healthy Texas</a>&quot; positions in a press conference and at his web site.</p>

<p>There's a lot of good stuff in there.&nbsp; And he makes it clear that Gov. Rick Perry's neglect of state parks and other aspects of our shared environment, will not continue under a Governor Chris Bell:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Either Rick Perry doesn't get it or he doesn't care. Over the past six years, his failed policies have brought about the trifecta of dirtier air, dirtier water and dirtier land. The children of Texas are now more likely to be sick and less likely to have health care. 10 million people per year visit Texas State Parks, yet Perry’s response is to cut their budget by 10 percent and close 18 parks.6 Once again, Rick Perry has led Texas in the race to the bottom of our nation’s air and water pollution and turned his back on our open spaces. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Governing is about setting priorities, and Rick Perry’s only priority is giving big polluters and campaign contributors a free pass. He even went so far as to make a deal with polluters to allow the weakening of oversight on coal plant pollution in the state. Rick Perry then filled his campaign coffers with contributions from these same energy companies, turning a blind eye as pregnant women and unborn children are now exposed to unhealthy levels of mercury.7 </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Rick Perry’s culture of corruption has wrested control of Texas lands and waterways from local residents and left them with skyrocketing utility rates and medical bills. He has sold the health and heritage of Texas to the highest bidder. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The scars from this culture of corruption can be seen across the face of Texas; in acres of farm land paved over for toll roads; in city parks choked with smog and school children sick with asthma; in rivers being dammed and lakes running dry; in state parks closing down and coal plants going up; in rising temperatures and skyrocketing utility prices.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Part of his plan to protect Texas' environment includes:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Develop a dependable source of funding for acquisition, maintenance, and management of Texas state &amp; local parks to meet growing habitat preservation and recreation needs. Rep. Hilderbran's sports tax </span><span style="color: #000000;">[see </span><span style="color: #003300;"><a href="../../../2006/03/texas_state_par.html"><span style="color: #000000;">here</span></a></span><span style="color: #000000;"> for more info] </span><span style="color: #003300;">is a good start.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Great for Chris Bell.&nbsp; And great news for the huge number of Texans who care about our state's parks and environment.</span></p>

                                <p>I must admit that I did not see this coming.  One thing I didn't figure Tom DeLay for was a quitter.  Yet it turns out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/03/washington/03cnd-delay.html?hp&ex=1144123200&en=aa824e5a58112b12&ei=5094&partner=homepage">he is</a>.<blockquote><em>Rep. Tom DeLay will announce on Tuesday that he will not seek re-election and will leave Congress within months, according to congressional aides.<br><br>The aides said that Mr. DeLay, who has been swept into an election-year lobbying scandal, was calling congressional leaders Monday night to inform them of his plans.<br><br>...<br><br>The news of Mr. DeLay's decision broke on television stations about 10 p.m. Monday night. An article on the Time magazine Web site, based on an interview with Mr. DeLay, earlier in the day, said that Mr. DeLay "vowed to pursue an aggressive speaking and organizing campaign aimed at promoting foster care, Republican candidates and a closer connection between religion and government."</em></blockquote>Good riddance.</p>

<p>Now, what about all the rest of the GOP politicians who have modelled their behavior after his corrupt example?</p>

                                <p>The B and B team voted just as the polls closed last night (one of us was literally the last one in the door), and helped state Rep.

<p>In the GOP races for the State Board of Education, the sensible Republicans <a href="http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/06prirep.htm?x=0&amp;y=5381&amp;id=216#10">did not fare well</a>. Religious extremist, Leininger-supported, Cynthia Dunbar walloped Tony Dale, 64%-36%, while incumbent Dan Montgomery only pulled 35% in his race against former Rep. Ken Mercer, who has just under 50% (95 votes shy out of 50,000 with all the precincts reporting).&nbsp; </p>

<p>If Mercer stays under 50%, there will be a runoff and Montgomery is not dead yet.&nbsp; I wish I could have voted in that contest—it is my district, after all—but due to the closed primary system and the lack of a Democratic candidate for that state board seat, I feel a bit disenfranchised in that race.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Today is primary day in Texas. </p>

<p>National attention is focusing on how well the indicted former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay performs in his GOP primary and also on former congressman Ciro Rodriguez's <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/3/6/112321/6931">challenge</a> to incumbent Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar in a south Texas congressional district stretching from San Antonio to Laredo. The conservative, Bush-friendly, Laredo-resident Cuellar ousted then-incumbent, San Antonio-resident Rodriguez in 2004 by a few dozen votes in a primary election that saw the mysterious late appearance of a few dozen votes from Laredo—votes that pushed Cuellar over the top. Now Rodriguez is trying to win his seat back, and is hoping for a big turnout in the San Antonio portion of the district to do so.</p>

<p>Statewide attention is focusing on a few GOP primaries for the legislature, where five incumbents are being <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/03/james-leininger-and-leininger-five.html">challenged</a> by candidates funded virtually exclusively by the wealthy religious conservative James Leininger; on Chris Bell and Bob Gammage vying for the Democratic nomination for governor; and on the Democratic state senate <a href="../../../2006/02/uresti_v_madla_.html">Uresti v. Madla</a> race in my neck of the woods, which has amazingly gotten even uglier in the couple weeks since I wrote about it.</p>

<p>But behind these high-profile races, there is much more.</p>

<p>In the ongoing <a href="../../../2006/02/texas_textbook_.html">political fight</a> over the content of Texas public schools' textbooks, two GOP primaries for the Texas State Board of Education are worth keeping an eye on tonight. Religious extremists are looking to replace two members of the state board with two of their own. They already control at least five seats of the fifteen on the board. Apparently no Democrats are running in either race, so the GOP primary is where all the action is.</p>

<p>In district 10, stretching from the area north of Austin to the western suburbs of Houston, a moderate incumbent board member is stepping down. The GOP candidates in the race to replace her are Cynthia Dunbar and Tony Dale.</p>

<p>Dunbar is funded virtually exclusively by the family of notorious billionaire James Leininger, the same fellow funding primary challenges to many of the few remaining sensible Republicans in the state legislature. Dunbar homeschools her children and believes, according to a press release on her web site, that &quot;all students should be taught to be patriots.&quot; The Austin American-Statesman <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/02/20SBOE.html">reports</a>, &quot;Dunbar said that she would support an intelligent design curriculum and that the concept is 'at least as viable, if not more so, than evolution.'&quot;</p>

<p>Tony Dale is endorsed by the retiring incumbent, Cynthia Thornton, and, unlike Dunbar, sends his child to public schools. In further contrast to Dunbar, he is not an activist in the anti-evolution movement. The American-Statesman writes, &quot;Dale said that the [ID curriculum] issue has been settled and that unless the law is revisited, parents must teach those values at home and in church.&quot; He stresses 'local control' of schools, which is contrary to the desires of the extremists, who want to take over the State Board and then dictate standards for the entire state.</p>

<p>In district 5—which encompasses northern Bexar County (including my area), much of Austin, and most of the central Texas Hill Country—former San Antonio state legislator Ken Mercer and physicist Mark Loewe are challenging the incumbent board member Dan Montgomery in the GOP primary.</p>

<p>Mercer, based on his campaign website, is allying himself with the extremist faction. He wants more state control of public schools, and also wants to enforce ideological purity in the GOP. The San Antonio Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA022006.9G.boardofed.21081d49.html">quoted</a> him saying, &quot;I want to restore some of the power to the state board that was stripped by the Legislature in 1995. I have good relationships with folks in the House and the Senate and I want to work with them to restore that power.&quot; On the anti-evolution front, he says, according to the American-Statesman, &quot;We should let kids hear both sides of the story.&quot; This puts him firmly in the ID-promoting camp.</p>

<p>Incumbent Montgomery, like Tony Dale, is a &quot;local control&quot; promoter. This has apparently earned him the enmity of the extremist camp. Also, he says, as paraphrased by the American-Statesman, that &quot;the strengths and weaknesses of the theory of evolution should be taught but that science classes should be restricted to subjects supported by scientific evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>The other challenger, Mark Loewe, is a physicist from Austin. He doesn't fit neatly into the GOP schism over local versus state control of schools. The Express-News writes about him: &quot;Loewe frequently testifies before the state board and both the House and Senate education committees. He's developed detailed plans on how to save the state money on textbook purchasing. Loewe said cheaper textbooks would mean students could keep them and build their own resource library.&quot;</p>

<p>We'll know soon if the religious extremists succeed or fail in replacing two, somewhat sensible, GOP members of the State Board of Education with two more members allied with the cause of dictating ideological content of textbooks throughout the state's public schools and promoting the non-scientific dogma of Intelligent Design in science classrooms.</p>

                                <p>There is a heated Democratic primary campaign going on for the state senate district that encompasses my neck of the woods.  The long-time incumbent, Frank Madla, is being challenged by state representative Carlos Uresti.</p>

<p><img alt="District19map_1" title="District19map_1" src="../../../../photos/uncategorized/district19map_1.gif" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" />This <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/mt/archives/2006/01/4040_get_to_kno_6.html">district</a> is geographically huge.  (Here's a <a href="http://www.senate.state.tx.us/Icons/Dist_Maps/Dist19_Map.pdf">map</a>.)  It contains much of southern and western Bexar County, a broad finger into my area of northwest Bexar County, and a vast expanse of sparsely-populated west Texas&#151;practically all the way to El Paso, several hundred miles away.  Despite that great rural and desert expanse, nearly half the voters of the district reside in the San Antonio metropolitan area.</p>

<p>A couple months back, upon hearing of Uresti's challenge to Madla, I <a href="../../../2005/12/uresti_v_madla.html">asked</a> for more information to help me make up my mind who to support and vote for.  Sure enough, the local blogging community has come through, providing extensive coverage of this race.  (No doubt they wouldn't have bothered if I hadn't asked.  Right?)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.carlosuresti.com/"><img alt="Uresti_2" title="Uresti_2" src="../../../images/uresti_2.png" width="105" height="51" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a><a href="http://www.frankmadla.com/index.html"><img alt="FrankMadla" title="Madla" src="../../../images/madla.jpg" width="150" height="49" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>In particular, San Antonio bloggers Matt at <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/">Just Another Blog</a>, Cincinnatus at <a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com">The Jeffersonian</a>, and Eddie at <a href="http://theredstate.com/">The Red State</a> have posted repeatedly about events in the Uresti-Madla battle.  Joining them has been Houston blogger Charles Kuffner at <a href="http://offthekuff.com/">Off the Kuff</a> and the Austin group blog <a href="http://burntorangereport.com/">Burnt Orange Report</a>, which published interviews of both candidates in late January.</p>

<p>This has been an extremely negative campaign, virtually right from the start in December.  The rationale for Uresti's run is that Madla has not represented the people of his district well and not been a good Democrat.  Uresti's supporters, which include all of the blogs mentioned above (I have not seen a pro-Madla blog), have not been shy in tearing down Madla's recent record.  </p>

<p>And neither has Uresti himself, who stated in the opening of his interview at <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/mt/archives/2006/01/4040_an_intervi_2.html">Burnt Orange Report</a>:  "On too many bills, Frank crossed the aisle to vote with Republican leadership to balance our state’s budget on the backs of those who could least afford it. He became more interested in helping powerful special interests while kids went without health insurance, elderly people lost nursing home allowances, and state employee ranks were decimated for the benefit of a few big private interests. Frank’s votes were a slap in the face to me as a Texas Democrat, as a fellow legislator, and as a resident of the district he represents. I live where those children go without medical care. I see the results of his votes. I could have waited a few more years until he finally retired, but I don’t think the vulnerable constituents in his district can."</p>

<p>What are the specific charges against Madla?</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest issue Uresti's supporters have with Madla's record is Madla's tendency to allow harmful legislation introduced by the GOP leadership to advance through early stages of the legislative process when he has the power to kill it.  One bill, in particular, has raised their ire, as alluded to by Uresti in his statement above.  </p>

<p>Officially known as House Bill 2292, it was passed by the legislature in 2003, privatizing many of the state's human services functions at no net savings and cutting off many thousands of people from Medicaid and CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program.  Madla voted against the bill in the end, but apparently voted with Republicans on earlier procedural votes that could have stopped the bill in its tracks.</p>

<p>Madla's defense?  In a January article in the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA011206.01B.MadlaUresti.1772a09d.html">San Antonio Express-News</a>, he is quoted as saying, "I voted against final passage of HB 2292, and I was among those who fought for, and helped to restore, previous cuts in health and human services as quickly as were able to do so."  He also said, "I believe that I was elected to serve all of the citizens of Texas and primarily those who reside in the district I represent, not just those of one party or the other."</p>

<p>In his January interview at <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/mt/archives/2006/01/4040_an_intervi_5.html">Burnt Orange Report</a> (BOR), Madla said, "It is my observation that, for major legislation, it is best to allow the process to move forward with hopes that resolutions for the most problematic issues will be developed. When the end product did not seem to do that, I did not support the bill in its final form. As to the eventual verdict on privatization, the jury is still out on that."</p>

<p>This is clearly a recurring theme with Madla.  Last spring, I <a href="../../../2005/04/state_sen_madla.html">wrote</a> that "State Sen. Madla has a lot of explaining to do," after he took actions that allowed a pro-development, anti-local-regulation bill to advance through the legislative process despite his stated misgivings.  He voted against this bill (SB 848) in the end, but his earlier actions had allowed it to reach a final vote (where it passed by a depressingly large margin).</p>

<p>Uresti feels differently about how a legislator should behave when confronted with poor bills, telling BOR, "My time in the House also taught me this about the legislative process: some bills must be blocked and killed when you have the chance. Moving a bad bill 'through the process' just builds momentum that can’t be stopped in the end."</p>

<p>Another of the principal complaints against Madla is that he is too close to the Republicans in Austin.  Uresti's supporters highlight the fact that several GOP legislators and lobbyists are amongst Madla's supporters in his re-election bid.</p>

<p>None other than Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst was a <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/006635.html#006635">featured guest</a> at a fundraiser for Madla last month.  Two former aides to Governor Rick Perry and a former state senator, present lobbyist, and author of the aforementioned HB 2292, Arlene Wohlgemuth, also were listed as <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2006/01/wohlegemuth_red.html">attendees</a> at that fundraiser.</p>

<p>Madla's defense is that he's a bi-partisan kind of guy.  While some Republicans support him, so do plenty of Democrats.  The <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA021406.3B.notebook.d535f05.html">Express-News</a> wrote earlier this week, "Several Democratic heavyweights turned out Monday to vouch for [Madla's] bona fides, endorsing him at a media conference at the Menger Hotel. They included former Mayor Henry Cisneros, County Commissioner Tommy Adkisson, City Councilman Richard Perez, Constable Ruben Tejeda and Madla's Senate colleague, Leticia Van de Putte."  </p>

<p>Madla told BOR, "In the Senate, you have to be able to work with both sides of the aisle, and I've learned to do that with both moderate and conservative Republicans. Doing so does not mean that you have to give up your values or your party allegiance and loyalties, but you learn how to work together for the good of the whole state and for your own district."  He claims that as a result of his bi-partisan skills, he passed 68 bills last year.</p>

<p>Uresti's supporters counter that other prominent Democrats oppose Madla and support Uresti.  The most celebrated of these is a state senator from El Paso named <a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com/2006/01/conscience-of-senate-endorses-carlos.html">Elliott Shapleigh</a>, who has said, "The first vote that the (Senate) Republicans go to get is Frank Madla's."</p>

<p>The most recent, and most sensational, complaint against Madla arose out of the very fundraiser that sparked the above complaint.  He was filmed <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/02/frank-madla-doesnt-like-bloggers.html">saying</a>, "When I get to the state Capitol, I lock the Democratic Party in my trunk."  So the charge is that Madla not only is too close to the GOP establishment in this state, but that he doesn't respect his own political party.</p>

<p>Madla's defense here is that Uresti is running a campaign of dirty tricks, although the Uresti campaign denies that the person who taped the event worked for them.</p>

<p>Madla, on the other hand, is not above some tricks of his own.  A supporter of his managed to get an <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/01/frank-madla-buys-good-press_31.html">elementary school</a> named after Madla just as the primary campaign was starting to heat up.</p>

<p>So, after watching and reading about all this over the last few weeks, I have some definite ideas on how to vote come the March primary, though I have not yet made a final decision.  The charges against Madla that have been echoing around the Texas blogosphere in recent days appear damning on the surface, and Madla's own clumsy choice of words at the January fundraiser reinforces them.  But his staunch support from so many prominent Texas Democrats indicates that there is more to the story.</p>

<p>In addition, the anti-Madla rhetoric occasionally ventures into the realm of the absurd, risking tainting the credibility of the justifiable criticism.  Perhaps the most emphatic Uresti supporter amongst Texas bloggers, Eddie of The Red State recently <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2006/02/madlas_lies_and.html">wrote</a>, "[Madla] hates poor children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled. Now, he hates the Republicans who gave him ten of thousands of dollars. He can't have it both ways."  I greatly respect Eddie's work at The Red State, but such unbelievable statements are not going to convince anyone who is still on the fence.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, back when Uresti first announced, Eddie <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2005/12/carlos_uresti_t.html">wrote</a>, "Am I bias on this race? Hell yeah. I have worked for [Uresti] and believe in him from personal experience."  This is an angle I'd love to hear more about.</p>

<p>Large chunks of <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA020906.05B.Uresti_Donor.b5b4858.html">money</a> are flowing in to both sides of this fight, so it is likely to be very competitive.  Unfortunately, all the acrimony may make it hard for Democrats to unite behind the victor.  Given that Bush won a slight majority in the district in <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/par_rpts/current/senate/dist19/r8.htm">2004</a>, the general election may not be a sure bet for the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>Early voting starts on Tuesday, February 21 (only five more days!), while the official primary day is Tuesday, March 7.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My last two non-birding posts were about two seemingly unrelated subjects:  the attempt by Texas billionaire Red McCombs to install <a href="../../../2006/02/point_man_on_bu.html">Mark Rey</a> at the helm the U.S. Forest Service so that he can build a huge ski resort in Colorado, and the attempt by Texas elected officials to quietly build a huge system of <a href="../../../2006/02/toll_roads_in_t.html">toll roads</a> that may not be either wanted or needed by the population of this state.</p>

<p>But it turns out there is a connection after all.  And it's right on the surface.  His name is Tom Loeffler.</p>

<p>Loeffler was the fellow McCombs turned to for help in getting Bush to appoint Mark Rey to his current position overseeing our national forests.  And Loeffler's law firm&#151lobbying firm more like it&#151;is the first private industry board of directors representative listed on the San Antonio Mobility Coalition's <a href="http://www.samobilitycoalition.org/aboutUs.htm">web site</a>.  (The San Antonio Mobility Coalition is one of the state-government-created organizations responsible for driving the toll road plans to completion.)</p>

<p>Loeffler is described in the Denver Post article on McCombs and Rey as a former Republican Congressman from Texas, a current lobbyist, and "a top fundraiser for Bush."  According to Texans for Public Justice, he has a long and sordid <a href="http://www.tpj.org/docs/pioneers/pioneers_view.jsp?id=28">history</a> in Texas politics, much of it closely connected with that former governor who now resides in the White House.</p>

<p>Amidst the circle of GOP powerbrokers, lobbyist Loeffler clearly is near the very center.  And guess who he is getting behind now, according to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/02/14/mccain.tm/">Time magazine</a> last week:<blockquote><em>None of [Senator John] McCain's new allies are more impressive than former Congressman Tom Loeffler of Texas, a mega--fund raiser for Bush. Loeffler says he has told McCain he is willing "to be your bottle washer, or I'll fix the flat on the Straight Talk Express bus." While Loeffler notes that he has been "very, very, very close friends" with McCain since the 1970s, he says McCain is finding new chums among the same Republicans who invested so much to keep him out of the White House six years ago. "The battle of 2000 is far behind," Loeffler says, "and they are looking for a winner in 2008."</em></blockquote>Keep this in mind come the next Presidential election.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/31/politics/politicsspecial1/31alito.html?hp&amp;ex=1138770000&amp;en=03153f62a6ddc865&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage">spectre</a> of Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court is extremely worrisome to those who care about the well-being of this country's democracy and a reasonable balance of power between monied interests and the rest of society. With the vote against the filibuster last night in the U.S. Senate, I notice at least a few progressive bloggers are using this occasion to rail against members of the Democratic Party, if not the entire party. </p>

<p>But Alito is a creature entirely of the Republican Party. While perhaps understandable to lash out in a moment of anguish, blaming the Democratic Party (or certain members thereof) is nonetheless completely misguided. It is the Bush administration and its toadies in the GOP that have forced Alito upon us. And it was our inability to convey our supposedly obvious and just cause to the general public, both in November 2004 and now, that has allowed his ascendancy. </p>

<p>Fortunately, many other progressive bloggers are taking a more sober look at the situation, celebrating those who helped in this battle, and resolving to figure out how to do better next time. For as dangerous as he is, Alito is only one vote in one branch of government.</p>

		<a href="../../../2005/07/its_not_the_cit.html">Sink the Urban Archipelago</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Ed Stephan, a sociologist guest-blogging at the Carpetbagger Report, suggests a <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/4652.html">political strategy</a> for the Democratic Party: "It's the cities, stupid."  <br />
<em><blockquote>I think, instead, it's high time we identify with our <strong>Urban Base</strong>, in every state red or blue. We should aim to make ourselves the party of choice for every <strong>urban place</strong> in America.</blockquote></em>(The emphasis is his.)  </p>

<p>His argument, though, strikes me as so wrong, counterproductive, and destructive, that I hardly know where to begin. </p>

<p>Stephan's motivation is two-fold:  (1) Census bureau data show that the "urban" population vastly outnumbers the "rural" population, by a current, and increasing, margin of nearly four to one; and (2) he claims "Urbanites are tolerant (even accepting) of many of the things Republicans brag about hating."</p>

<p>For the Cenus bureau, "urban" (i.e., non-rural) means only <a href="http://ask.census.gov/cgi-bin/askcensus.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=623&p_created=1092150238&p_sid=Tmxpq1Kh&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9NyZwX3Byb2RzPSZwX2NhdHM9JnBfcHY9JnBfY3Y9JnBfcGFnZT0xJnBfc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9dXJiYW4gcnVyYWw*&p_li=&p_topview=1">this</a>:  "An urban area generally consists of a large central place and adjacent densely settled census blocks that together have a total population of at least 2,500 for urban clusters, or at least 50,000 for urbanized areas."  By that definition, no wonder "urbanites" are so dominant.  A population of 2,500 is tiny village by the standards of the areas most people think about when the word urban is used.  </p>

<p>A more useful division would be between true urban (the residents of city cores that Stephan appears to be referring to when he uses the word "urban"), suburban, exurban, and rural.  I don't have numbers handy, but I strongly suspect that the size of the true urban crowd would not dominate that classification.  </p>

<p>Stephan cites, and adopts the conclusions of, a widely-circulated article from immediately after the election last fall called <a href="http://www.urbanarchipelago.com/">The Urban Archipelago</a>.  He calls it "excellent," and "a brilliant analysis."  When I first read it many months ago, though, I came to a very different conclusion.  I found it ridiculously simplistic and full of insulting stereotypes.  Here is a sample:<em><blockquote>Citizens of the Urban Archipelago reject heartland "values" like xenophobia, sexism, racism, and homophobia, as well as the more intolerant strains of Christianity that have taken root in this country. And we are the real Americans. They--rural, red-state voters, the denizens of the exurbs--are not real Americans. They are rubes, fools, and hate-mongers.</blockquote></em><br />
There is much more along those lines:<em><blockquote>The Republicans have the federal government--for now. But we've got Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, New York City (Bloomberg is a Republican in name only), and every college town in the country. We're everywhere any sane person wants to be. Let them have the shitholes, the Oklahomas, Wyomings, and Alabamas. We'll take Manhattan.</blockquote></em>And how about this gem?<em><blockquote>To red-state voters, to the rural voters, residents of small, dying towns, and soulless sprawling exburbs, we say this: Fuck off.</blockquote></em>That entire article is one big rant about a painful, lost election.  It's essentially arguing for political warfare between big cities and everybody else.  Thanks to the Republicans, we already have that, and Democrats, are on the losing side of that numbers game.  And even if the facts were different and we were winning such a political civil war, the concept of pitting the dominant segment of the population against the rest should be repugnant to American values.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Stephan has not just adopted the conclusions of the authors of <em>The Urban Archipelago</em>, he has adopted some of their divisive, stereotyping attitude as well, as he concludes with this:<em><blockquote>The Democratic Party should focus on cities, leave the stagnating hillbillies to the GOP, and sigh "good riddance".</blockquote></em>Even without the insults, this is simple bad political strategy.  We already get huge majorities in many big cities, and smaller majorities in most of the rest.  Yet that, along with the huge number of non-big-city Democratic voters like myself, is not quite enough to win control of the Federal government.  If our plans for the country are superior, we should be able to convince enough extra suburban voters, exurban voters, rural voters, and brand new voters, to come to our side.</p>

<p>With the insults, forget it.</p>
