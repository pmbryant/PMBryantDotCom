		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A recent op-ed in the San Antonio Express-News argued for <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/stories/MYSA062005.5B.Levincomment.1c76b25b.html">lowering the bar</a> for passing new amendments to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; The author's rationale?&nbsp; To solve the controversy over control of the judicial branch.</p><blockquote><p><em>
The controversy that now embroils our judiciary is a result of judges 
effectively amending the Constitution to create new rights, like abortion. While reading out of the Constitution rights specifically enumerated, such as the right to bear arms, some might say these changes are positive and reflect the evolution of public opinion, but if they had been made through the formal amendment process rather than by judges, a judge's political views would be irrelevant and judicial selection would be a noncontroversial task of finding the best lawyers to faithfully interpret the Constitution as if it were a contract.</em></p></blockquote><p>The author, Marc A. Levin, while merely described as &quot;an attorney in Austin&quot; in his tag, is a <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2004-06-04/pols_feature3.html">conservative activist</a> and heavily involved with pro-corporate <a href="http://www.texaspolicy.com/staff_member.php?staff_id=32">think</a> <a href="http://www.politicalusa.com/columnists/levin/default.htm">tanks</a>.&nbsp; From his article, he clearly would like to see new amendments of a conservative bent.&nbsp; Presumably the Equal Rights Amendment is not high on his priority list.</p>

<p>While there might be a reasonable argument for making it easier to amend the Constitution, Levin's particular argument strikes me as half-baked.&nbsp; Even if there were a problem such as the author claims, it would not be solved by adding new amendments to the Constitution.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Activist judges, whoever and whereever they may be, would still be able to &quot;create new rights.&quot;&nbsp; Or, as I would put it, activist judges would still be able to invalidate corporate regulations based on archaic readings of the Constitution.&nbsp; By definition, &quot;activist&quot; judges are not restrained by the text in the Constitution and its amendments.</p>

<p>Levin goes on to argue that since so few amendments have been passed in recent decades,&nbsp; the process is simply too hard.&nbsp; But there are twenty-seven amendments, so clearly it is not impossible.&nbsp; Perhaps the lack of recent successful amendments is a symptom that most of the country is satisfied with the Constitution in its current form?</p>

<p>Despite the occasional, lamentable, failure of worthwhile amendments, such as the Equal Rights Amendment, I believe that the difficulty of amending the U.S. Constitution—and the stability thereby provided—is one of the reasons why our Constitution has been so successful.&nbsp; Adopting Levin's proposal would make it easier for temporary political majorities to work their will with the fundamental document of our nation.&nbsp; One decade abortion is a constitutional right; the next it is not.&nbsp; One decade corporations have extensive constitutional protections; the next they do not.&nbsp; Fundamental human and civil rights could be taken away, then given back, then taken away again.&nbsp; Think of the alcohol-prohibition amendment in 1919 and its repeal in 1933, but with many more issues and much more often.<br /> </p>

<p>Respect for the Constitution would gradually wither.&nbsp; The result would be quite detrimental to the long-term survival of our Constitutional republic.</p>

another vote on Bolton's nomination and said that Bush must decide the

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Young progressive blogger <a title="Ezra Klein: Repeal McCain-Feingold!" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/repeal_mccainfe.html">Ezra Klein</a> has echoed an appeal by economics professor <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/06/time_to_repeal.html#more">James Hamilton</a> to repeal the McCain-Feingold campaign reform act.&nbsp; The McCain-Feingold law, officially known as the <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/campaign/legislation/bcralaw/index.cfm">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002</a>, did two things:&nbsp; (1) eliminate the old, unregulated &quot;soft money&quot; contributions to political parties, and (2) place stricter regulations on campaign ads in the period immediately preceding elections.</p>

<p>Both Klein and Hamilton dislike the new system of independent groups (called &quot;527 organizations&quot;) that has sprung up, largely in response to the ban on soft money.&nbsp; Hamilton further dislikes what he thinks are free speech restrictions as a result of the tighter regulation of campaign ads.</p>

<p>Campaign finance reform has been a very complicated issue, and I can't claim to fully understand all the details of the current system (or even the pre-2002 system).&nbsp; But I think the fundamental principles of the McCain-Feingold law are sound, so what deficiencies arise can be fixed by tweaking the law, rather than simply throwing it out.</p>

<p>Klein writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>I'd much rather have parties absorbing unlimited contributions than
watch the funding get sucked up by unaccountable, unknowable 527's. 
Parties and campaigns can, at the least, be held accountable.&nbsp; 527's,
on the other hand, are just hatchet men, called in for the dirty work
and disavowed for the cameras.</em></p></blockquote><p>But independent &quot;hatchet men&quot; existed long before McCain-Feingold became law.&nbsp; Repealing the act would do nothing to eliminate them.&nbsp; Requiring disclosure of their funding sources, however, would help solve the &quot;unaccountable, unknowable&quot; problem.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I do oppose efforts to impose soft money restrictions on independent groups like 527 organizations, as <a href="http://www.reason.com/rauch/050905.shtml">some Senators</a> have proposed.&nbsp; Restricting donatons to independent groups of citizens violates the fundamental principles of our government.</p>

<p>How to treat the regulations on campaign ads that Hamilton dislikes is a much more complicated issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've never been entirely comfortable with that aspect of McCain-Feingold.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I think Hamilton's criticism is overblown.</p><blockquote><p><em> So what exactly now defines prohibited participation in an election?&nbsp; When Congressman David 
Dreier (R-CA) ran into a withering hail of criticism last October for his position on 
immigration from co-hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou at Los Angeles <a href="http://www.kfi640.com/main.html"> radio station KFI</a>, the National Republican 
Congressional Committee <a href="http://www.kfi640.com/timages/page/media/JNKFEC.pdf"> filed a 
complaint</a>
with the Federal Election Commission, arguing that, since the radio
station on which the views were expressed was owned by a corporation,
these broadcasts represented an illegal corporate contribution to the
campaign of Dreier's opponent, Democrat Cynthia Matthews. The NRCC
complaint further argued that, under McCain-Feingold, the radio hosts
could personally be criminally prosecuted for felonies for assisting in
Matthews' campaign in this way, specifically mentioning a 5-year jail
term. To be sure, the radio hosts had been vitriolic in their attacks
on Dreier, and described their agenda openly as a &quot;fire Dreier&quot;
campaign. But is it really a felony in America today to say loudly and
repeatedly that a certain elected official needs to be dumped?&nbsp; </em></p></blockquote><p>To answer his question:&nbsp; apparently not, since I presume the radio hosts and owner are not being prosecuted for this.&nbsp; The NRCC, in typical Republican fashion, is always going to try to intimidate its critics prior to an election.&nbsp; If McCain-Feingold were repealed, they would simply find another law to use, and there are plenty of earlier campaign regulations they can point to.</p>

<p>So while McCain-Feingold obviously is not perfect and leaves a lot to be desired, a strong case for repealing it has yet to be made.</p>

<p>The ultimate, simple, solution to campaign financing, which Ezra Klein alludes to in his post, remains requiring television and radio stations that broadcast over the public airwaves to donate air time to candidates in the weeks preceding elections.&nbsp; One of the most expensive line items in campaigns is thus eliminated.&nbsp; And candidates of unequal funding enter the playing field at a much more equal level.&nbsp; Of course, given the huge windfall that broadcast stations make from political ads, they are not going to like this idea at all.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Cernig at <a href="https://cernigsnewshog.blogspot.com/2005/05/kindergarten-politics.html">NewsHog</a> proposes a solution to the battle over judicial nominations in the United States Senate:</p><blockquote><p><em>
You know I am one of those &quot;damn furriners&quot;, right? So I speak from total ignorance, that's a given.<br /><br />So can someone explain to me why the obvious solution to all the kindergarten name-calling hasn't been proposed? <br /><br />...<br /><br />How about just introducing term limits for Supreme Court judges? That
way no-one can pack the judiciary with their own ideological allies for
a generation. Both sides say that's something to avoid, don't they? So
then there's no problem with always giving an up-or-down vote. Both
sides agree that's the best possible way for democracy to work, don't
they?<br /><br />There, problem solved, can you all run along and play nice now?</em></p></blockquote><p>Alas, this isn't much of a solution.&nbsp; If the GOP were interested in being reasonable and responsible about
judicial nominations, there would be no fight in the first place.</p>

<p>Enacting this proposal would require a constitutional amendment, therefore requiring support from a 2/3 vote in both houses of Congress, as well as from 3/4 of all the state legislatures.&nbsp; Since the GOP is not interested in anything short of the ability to put every single person on the courts that they desire for as long as possible, this simply will not happen.</p>

<p>The GOP used arcane senate rules to block dozens of Clinton's judicial
nominees in the late 1990s, then changed those rules to prevent
Democrats from using them to block Bush's extreme choices, yet they
still want more.&nbsp; The vast majority of Bush's judicial nominees have been approved, yet they still want more.&nbsp; The Supreme Court already consists of seven Republicans versus two Democrats, yet they still want more.</p>

<p>Why do they want more?&nbsp; What is really at stake?<br /> </p>

<p>The conventional wisdom implies that the underlying reasons for this political fight concern abortion and Roe v. Wade.&nbsp; Yet everything I've been able to discern after watching and reading about D.C. politics for well over a decade now suggests that this is a mere cover story—a front for a more ambitious, far less popular, <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/5/4/23931/56413">agenda</a>.&nbsp; That agenda is to use the courts to <a href="http://www.acsblog.org/judicial-nominations-700-the-return-of-constitution-in-exile.html">invalidate</a> much of the progressive legislation enacted since the 1930s that serves to regulate the behavior of large corporations.</p>

<p>But the GOP controls Congress and the Presidency, right?&nbsp; If they wanted to invalidate that legislation, they could just do so directly, right?</p>

<p>In principle, yes, but in practice, no.&nbsp; In fact, they tried to do so with much environmental-protection legislation in 1995 back when the Gingrichites and Delayicans first took over Congress.&nbsp; That was the era in which Tom Delay declared the Environmental Protection Agency to be the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Tom_DeLay">gestapo of government</a>.&quot;&nbsp; The public backlash to the GOP's attempted actions in 1995 and 1996 was so intense that it shook them deeply.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ever since then, the GOP has turned to the dark side and taken the road of deception:&nbsp; proclaiming&nbsp; that they support laws for clean air and clean water and safe workplaces and more, but then in the background, acting to undermine those very laws.&nbsp; Bush managed to pass himself off as a &quot;moderate&quot; to many people in 2000 via just that tactic.&nbsp; And the tactic continues to define the GOP/Bush domestic strategy to this day.&nbsp; For instance, their strategy on Social Security is to loudly proclaim support for the program's goals while proposing policies that would drastically weaken it; their strategy on air pollution is to create a program called &quot;Clear Skies&quot; that would actually allow more pollution than the Clean Air Act; their strategy on forests is to create a program called &quot;Healthy Forests&quot; that gives away our National Forests to logging companies in the guise of preventing forest fires.</p>

<p>The GOP and Bush realize, from the 1995 Gingrichite failure, that they cannot directly repeal popular and successful laws such as the National Labor Relations Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and Endangered Species Act.&nbsp; They also realize that they cannot use their control of the executive branch to thwart these laws indefinitely.&nbsp; They will be sued and eventually forced by courts to actually comply with the letter of the laws, as has happened many, many times over the last couple decades.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, the GOP can make sure that the judges who will decide these cases are in their pockets.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the GOP is to put <a href="http://hnn.us/articles/1780.html">activist judges</a> on the Supreme Court and appellate courts to invalidate or restrict those very laws, returning the U.S. to a time when corporate oligarchs could run the country with impunity, at the expense of the quality of life of the rest of us.</p>

<p>University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein gives us an <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sunstein.html">example</a> of what may be in store for us if the GOP succeeds in their effort to stack the courts:</p><blockquote><p><em>But if several [Supreme Court] appointments are made under an extended Bush presidency,
the new court would likely do much more [than limit reproductive freedom]. It might strike down most
campaign-finance reform. It would probably be inclined to invalidate
parts of the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act as beyond
Congress' authority. It might well elevate commercial speech to the
same status as political speech--thus forbidding controls on
commercials by tobacco companies, among others. It would probably limit
congressional efforts to protect disabled people, women, and the
elderly from various forms of discrimination.</em></p></blockquote><p>If the GOP wants the country to move in this direction, let them try to do so legislatively rather than relying on this stealth judicial campaign.&nbsp; And then let the people of this country send them into the political wilderness for decades.</p>

                                <p>Chris Bowers at <a href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2005/5/16/114744/842">MyDD</a> points to a <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/dybdocroot/metro/20050505_Frey.pdf">study</a> that projects that Florida, Texas, and Arizona will be the top beneficiaries of new congressional seats and electoral votes over the next 25 years, with Florida supposedly gaining nine new seats, Texas eight, and Arizona five.&nbsp; He uses this information to call for Democrats to pay special attention to those three states:&nbsp; &quot;[I]f those three states are the highest growth areas, they need to be tagged for special attention now.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Here is another example where the electoral college is distorting the minds of some otherwise insightful political analysts.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Targeting individual states, in my opinion, is a mistake, unless it is in the final months of a closely-fought campaign that is short on resources.&nbsp; People are what should be targeted.&nbsp; Despite popular conception, there is not a great overall difference between the people who live in Texas and those who live in California, between the people who live in New York and those who live in Florida.&nbsp; I've discussed this in <a href="../../../2004/11/abandon_all_tal.html">two</a> <a href="../../../2004/11/yet_another_rea.html">posts</a> last fall about the fallacious and counterproductive nature of the &quot;red state&quot; and &quot;blue state&quot; labels.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Convince people that you have the right political program, and states will take care of themselves.</p>

<p>The GOP clearly recognize this, as their trademark deceptive rhetoric is not meant to target individual states, but widespread groups of people.&nbsp; And Clinton recognized this during his campaigns in the 1990s.&nbsp; His message of repairing the economy and our health care system was not specific to a few states.&nbsp; Hopefully a young, smart progressive strategist such as Bowers will come to realize that focusing so much on winning specific states is not the path to victory.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://img70.exs.cx/my.php?loc=img70&amp;image=aproval_vs_alert_chart_NEW.gif"><img width="180" height="121" border="0" src="../../../images/aproval_vs_alert_chart_new_1.gif" title="Aproval_vs_alert_chart_new_1" alt="Aproval_vs_alert_chart_new_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>A graph of an <a href="http://img70.exs.cx/my.php?loc=img70&amp;image=aproval_vs_alert_chart_NEW.gif">alleged correlation</a> between Bush's approval ratings and the timing of terror alerts, commonly attributed to a blog called <a href="https://juliusblog.blogspot.com/">JuliusBlog</a>, has been circulating around the internet and progressive discussion boards such as <a href="http://democraticunderground.com">Democratic Underground</a> since last summer.&nbsp; Now, in response to new comments from former Homeland Security Chief <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-05-10-ridge-alerts_x.htm">Tom Ridge</a>, the mega-blog <a href="https://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_05_08_atrios_archive.html#111582246000901418">Eschaton </a>has linked to this graph (though via a guest blogger and not by Atrios), so I suspect it will get a renewed rush of attention.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Those who promote the graph claim that it demonstrates proof that the Bush administration politicized terror alerts.&nbsp; Supposedly when Bush's approval ratings drop, the graph shows that he issues a terror alert.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But the graph actually shows no such correlation.<br /> </p>

<p>The graph does indicate that Bush's approval ratings were almost constantly in declining mode.&nbsp; So mere chance dictates that most terror alerts were issued during periods of declining approval ratings.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Only during three brief periods shown (perhaps four), did Bush's approval ratings rise:&nbsp; after September 11, 2001; at the onset of the Iraq War; at the capture of Saddam Hussein; and possibly after the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks.&nbsp; Despite the brief time period of these rising approval ratings, two of the six &quot;orange alerts&quot; on the graph came during these brief periods of rising Bush approval ratings.&nbsp; &nbsp;The hypothesis that Bush used terror alerts to boost sagging approval ratings cannot explain this.</p>

<p>One possible explanation for the common misinterpretation of this graph is that many are mistaking the wiggles of the red line for actual Bush popularity changes, though they are almost certainly statistically-insignificant noise in the data.&nbsp; Even so, there doesn't appear to be a correlation, so perhaps the true explanation is that people are simply seeing what they want to see.</p>

<p>But take away the data about approval ratings and simply examine the timeline of terror alerts.&nbsp; This shows that , come summer of 2004, in the run-up to the Presidential election, the frequency of terror alerts dramatically increased.&nbsp; In my view, this is an illustration (though of course it does not prove) that Bush indeed used terror alerts politically.&nbsp; Not to boost sagging approval ratings, but to maintain a climate of fear in this country, since fearful people rally around their leaders, no matter who they happen to be.</p>

<p>This became more necessary in 2004 than in 2002 and 2003, not just because of the impending election, but because memories of the September 11 attacks were fading.&nbsp; In fact, the gradual fading from memory of the horror of those events may well be an explanation for the slow, steady decline in Bush's approval outside of the three or four dramatic events mentioned above.<br /> </p>

<p>The new <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-05-10-ridge-alerts_x.htm">comments</a> from Tom Ridge, who claims that his reluctance to raise terror alert levels was often overruled by administration officials, reinforce the idea that the Bushies politicized the terror alert system prior to the 2004 election.&nbsp; But the graph of Bush's approval ratings versus the timeline of terror alerts does not.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/4176.html">Carpetbagger Report</a> and <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_10/004845.php">Kevin Drum</a>, I see that a <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Egrpproc/crisp/crisp10_1.pdf">quantitative analysis</a> of a possible correlation between Bush's popularity and terror alerts was actually performed by a Cornell University sociologist last fall.&nbsp; Through a complicated statistical analysis, the sociologist finds a small tendency for Bush's popularity to temporarily rise after government-issued terror warnings.&nbsp; The magnitude of the effect he found was <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Oct04/terrorist.Bush.ssl.html">2.75%</a> on average.&nbsp; This is a different effect than the one frequently cited by promoters of this graph, and quite small as well, even if the sociologist has managed to accurately control for all the other effects surrouding Presidential popularity.&nbsp; But it is a reminder of how thorough&nbsp; statistical analysis can be more useful in demonstrating a correlation than vague graphs.</p>

<p>UPDATE #2 (6:39pm):&nbsp; I added a paragraph towards the end of the article to clarify a point:&nbsp; the one beginning &quot;This became more necessary... .&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Believe it or not, a member of the GOP leadership in the Senate, Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, wants to prevent the National Weather Service from offering their <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/content/news/epaper/2005/04/21/m1a_wx_0421.html">weather reports</a> to the public for free.&nbsp; Apparently commercial outfits like AccuWeather don't feel they can compete.</p>

<p>I saw this news yesterday and thought about posting about it, but am now glad I didn't, since <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_04_17.php#005493">Josh Marshall</a> has put together the consummate summary:</p><blockquote><p><em>Plenty of federal legislation these days boils down to this sort of
rip-off of the public. But seldom is the equation so clear. </em></p>

<p>You<em><em>&nbsp;</em>paid for the data.&nbsp; </em>Your<em> tax dollars fund a
massive apparatus of meteorological data collection for reasons ranging
from agriculture to disaster safety to keeping airplanes in the air --
everything under the sun. You pay for it and this is just the feds
making it available to you on a website. The cost of letting you access
it must be minuscule compared to that of collecting it. Indeed, most of
the data these other guys sell is stuff they get from the feds or
fed-subsidized data collection.</em></p>

<p><em>So they're in the business of selling to you the information that
your tax dollars already went into collecting. And apparently they add
so little added value that they can't handle the competition when the
National Weather Service just gives it away. Santorum wants to make
these guys into some sort of information age tax farmers.</em></p>

<p><em>This article in the </em>Palm Beach Post<em> goes into greater
detail on the bill. And you can see from its proponents feeble
justifications just what a con this is. They note, for instance, that
the bill would not prevent the National Weather Service from alerting
the public to imminent disasters, which is awfully generous of them. </em></p>

<p><em>Indeed, the executive vice president of <em>AccuWeather</em>, Barry
Myers, probably had to have his face specially treated with some sort
of fixing agent to prevent him from laughing out loud when he <a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/content/news/epaper/2005/04/21/m1a_wx_0421.html">told</a> the <em>Post</em>
that the &quot;bill would improve public safety by making the weather
service devote its efforts to hurricanes, tsunamis and other dangers,
rather than duplicating products already available from the private
sector.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>In a different era, this would be unbelievable.&nbsp; Alas, these days it is sadly typical.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The House GOP, led by Tom DeLay, is about to pass a so-called &quot;energy bill&quot; that primarily consists of handouts of billions of taxpayer dollars to some of the GOP's largest campaign contributors, large energy companies.</p>

<p>President Bush <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5001-2005Apr20.html">claims</a> that he is mildly displeased with this:</p><blockquote><p><em>In a move aides described as a shot at House Republicans, Bush said,
&quot;With oil at more than $50 a barrel, by the way, energy companies do
not need taxpayers'-funded incentives to explore for oil and gas.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Yet nowhere do I see Bush threatening to veto the bill due to this wasteful use of the people's money.&nbsp; Nowhere do I see him using any leverage he might have to improve the bill.&nbsp; Quite the contrary.&nbsp; Instead, he is urging passage of this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/21/politics/21bush.html">corporate welfare</a> bill.</p><blockquote><p><em>President Bush demanded on Wednesday that Congress send a long-stalled
energy bill to his desk for signing by the summer, even as he admitted
that the legislation would do nothing to lower the rising gasoline
prices that polls suggest have cut into his approval ratings.</em></p></blockquote><p>So why does Bush claim to like the bill?&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><em>... Mr. Bush indicated that in his view the legislation would help the
United States overcome the growing worldwide demand for energy and the
nation's reliance on foreign oil and would make energy &quot;more affordable
and secure&quot; in the future.</em></p></blockquote><p>Yet the bill will not do any of this either.&nbsp; Increased subsidies to oil companies will only further this country's dependence on oil, and thus on foreign oil.&nbsp; No amount of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge can change the fact that the vast majority of the oil on this planet&nbsp; does not reside in the United States.</p><blockquote><p><em>Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the
House, estimated that the House bill would provide up to $22 billion to
the industry over a decade in the form of tax relief and potential
federal aid. He cited one Energy Department estimate that the measure
would boost gasoline prices by 3 cents a gallon.</em></p></blockquote><p>At least one Republican seems to understand the preposterousness of the claims surrounding this bill:</p><blockquote><p><em>Some Republicans, like Representative Sherwood Boehlert of New York,
the chairman of the Science Committee, opposed the measure. In Mr.
Boehlert's view, the bill would not reduce oil consumption by a single
barrel by 2020. &quot;That is both tragedy and farce,&quot; he said.</em></p></blockquote><p>Sadly, Republicans like Boehlert are few and far between.&nbsp; Most, it appears would prefer to shower huge amounts of other people's money on their campaign contributors, in exchange for virtually nothing.&nbsp; OK, it's only the taxpayers getting nothing in return—I'm sure the GOP will be hauling in plenty more campaign contributions in the future from these companies.</p>

<p>And the cycle of corruption continues.</p>

                                <p>Daily Kos has been engaged in a rhetorical war against the more conservative side of the Democratic party lately, especially against Joe Lieberman and the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC).&nbsp; That is a large part of the <a href="../../../2004/12/the_one_and_onl.html">reason</a> why a blog that was once was a daily must-read from me is only now an optional weekly, glance-it-over.&nbsp; I certainly am not a conservative Democrat, and Joe Lieberman is one of my least favorite Democratic Senators, but I have extremely little patience for pointless infighting at this time.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/4/13/16489/4501">post</a> today, kos uses a press release from the National Republican Senatorial Committee as the only evidence in another attack on Lieberman and the DLC.&nbsp; And then proceeds to label them as &quot;tools of the GOP.&quot;

</p>

<p>Hold on there, kos.&nbsp; Who exactly is the one using a GOP propaganda piece to attack Democrats?</p>

<p>Alas, this is not an isolated case of bad judgement.&nbsp; Just <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/4/11/164720/551">yesterday</a>, kos used similar right-wing propaganda to further his ongoing attacks on Joe Lieberman.&nbsp; See, some unknown conservative group ran a TV ad trashing Jimmy Carter, John Kerry, and Ted Kennedy and happened to include a picture of Lieberman alongside Ronald Reagan, Oliver North, and John Bolton.&nbsp; Kos highlighted this picture with the comment &quot;Lieberman in good company,&quot; and buried the source behind a link.<br /> </p>

<p>Twice in two days, kos has allowed himself to be used by GOP agents to help split Democrats.&nbsp; With his large readership, I sincerely hope he won't allow it to happen again.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One of our not-so-great Senators from the 
great state of Texas, John Cornyn, has furthered Tom DeLay's recent 
<a href="http://www.santamariatimes.com/articles/2005/04/04/sections/opinion/040405a.txt">vague threats</a> 
against the federal judiciary by airing his 
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26236-2005Apr4.html">concerns</a> 
that federal judges inspire violence against themselves with their
&quot;political&quot; decisions:
</p><blockquote><p><em>In a Senate floor speech in which he sharply criticized a 
recent Supreme Court ruling on the death penalty, 
Cornyn (R-Tex.) -- a former Texas Supreme Court justice 
and member of the Judiciary Committee -- said Americans are 
growing increasingly frustrated by what he describes as activist 
jurists.

<br /><br />&quot;It causes a lot of people, including me, great distress to see judges 
use the authority that they have been given to make raw political or 
ideological decisions,&quot; he said. Sometimes, he said, &quot;the Supreme Court 
has taken on this role as a policymaker rather than an enforcer of political 
decisions made by elected representatives of the people.&quot;

<br /><br />Cornyn continued: &quot;I don't know if there is a cause-and-effect connection, 
but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this 
country. . . . And I wonder whether there may be some connection between the 
perception in some quarters, on some occasions, where judges are making 
political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds 
up and builds up and builds up to the point where some people engage in, 
engage in violence. Certainly without any justification, but a concern 
that I have.&quot;</em> </p></blockquote><p>

As 
<a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_04_03.php#005332">Josh Marshall</a> 
points out, Cornyn is a &quot;wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bush White House.&quot;&nbsp; These, and Tom DeLay's earlier threat, are obviously not off-the-cuff remarks.
They are part of a long-term, calculated effort on the part of the GOP
to delegitimize the federal judiciary in the eyes of their rabid partisans.

</p>

<p>This campaign is obviously now ramping up.&nbsp; The GOP and the Bush administration 
used the (sure-loser) Schiavo case to bring the judicial issue back into the limelight, 
and now they are ramping up the anti-judge rhetoric.&nbsp; No doubt the ultimate 
goal is to make sure their base is completely up-in-arms when the time comes
for the Senate GOP to push through Bush's extremist judicial nominations
or the &quot;nuclear option&quot; of eliminating the traditional filibuster rules.
The result would be an prolonged era of conservative judicial activism, with courts
striking down, or severely curtailing, much of the popular, 
progressive legislation that has been enacted over the last seventy years—
legislation that the congressional GOP is too politically craven to revoke directly.&nbsp; </p>

<p>But why, if the GOP intends to advance their own judicial activism, are
they engaged in a war of words against federal judges?&nbsp; I belive it's
because that's all it is—a mere war of words.&nbsp; If they truly intended
to reduce the power of the judicial branch, Congress, from what I've read, has much more direct and
powerful means to do so, such as defunding courts and even impeaching judges.</p>

<p>Marshall Wittman at <a href="http://www.bullmooseblog.com/">Bull Moose</a>,
who I have much respect for, suggests that 
&quot;Democrats must renew their democratic spirit.&quot;&nbsp; On the contrary, 
the Democratic Party's stand against the stacking of the courts with conservative
extremists is a fight for the democratic spirit of the country.</p>

<p>Beyond the issue of the judiciary, it is sad, depressing, and 
downright dangerous that inhumane rhetoric like Cornyn's and Delay's 
is now an acceptable tactic on the part of leaders in the Republican party.&nbsp; 
To make sure that it doesn't remain an acceptable tactic, 
we need to turn their words against them, 
and make sure that the sensible majority in this country 
realize what people like Cornyn and DeLay and others in the GOP are saying.&nbsp; 
We cannot afford to allow these words to only get out to
the right-wing base for whom they are aimed and to the progressive activists
who are already aware.

</p>

<p>My local paper, the 
<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/">San Antonio Express-News</a>, 
does not appear to have any mention of Cornyn's statements today 
(at least in the online edition).&nbsp; 
The first small steps, on my part, are to write them and ask them to cover
this issue, and to ask for others to do the same for their own local media outlets.</p>
