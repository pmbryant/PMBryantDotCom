		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Is the Texas legislature planning to strip the power of Texas cities to regulate water quality?&nbsp; Based on this <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA032605.1A.water_quality.1748eae11.html">article</a> in the San Antonio Express-News over the weekend, it looks like this may be the situation:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
Advocates for the Edwards Aquifer, already stunned by the pace of development over the recharge zone, are incensed by bills making their way through the Texas Legislature that would gut the protections that do exist.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Even a representative for local developers who helped craft the compromises at the heart of the current protective city ordinances said common sense should lead people to oppose most of the proposed bills.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Observers say passage of the bills would undo years of efforts by those in San Antonio to pass ordinances striking a balance between development and preservation, to limit the density and types of construction over the area where rainfall and streamflows refill the aquifer. 
</em></p>

<p><em>
...
</em></p>

<p><em>
State Sen. Kenneth Armbrister, D-Victoria, who tried two years ago to yank water quality powers from the Edwards Aquifer Authority, is the author of most of the developer-friendly bills.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Armbrister's Senate Bill 1363 says cities don't have the authority of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to regulate water quality and that a city can enforce water quality rules adopted prior to passage of this bill only to the extent that they agree with the standards and practices of the state commission.
</em></p>

<p><em>
That effectively would gut the aquifer protection measures approved by the San Antonio City Council in early 1995 and by Austin voters in 1992, said Brad Rockwell, deputy director of the Save Our Springs Alliance in Austin.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Another Armbrister bill, SB 1362, would strip away a city's ability to regulate within its extraterritorial jurisdiction the density or number of buildings or lots and the percentage of land covered by concrete, buildings and other nonporous surfaces. The bill specifically removes an exemption that covers the Edwards recharge zone outside San Antonio.
</em></p>

<p><em>
The Legislature is on a five-day Easter holiday and Armbrister couldn't be reached for comment Friday.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Rockwell said the Armbrister bills appear to target cities that sit above the Edwards Aquifer and have taken steps to protect their drinking water source — San Antonio, Austin, San Marcos, Buda, Dripping Springs, Lakeway, Sunset Valley and others.
</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;We've got a huge amount of consensus that these kinds of water quality regulations are crucial,&quot; Rockwell said. &quot;To me, it's a fairly easy question, what's more important — protecting an irreplaceable water supply from contamination or allowing huge profits and high intensity development on the part of a handful of developers?&quot;</em></p>

</blockquote>

<p>First question:&nbsp; why the hell is a Democrat pushing these bills in a Republican-dominated legislature, doing the GOP's dirty work for them?</p>

<p>Prior to this article, last week, the Express-News published a <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/stories/MYSA032405.07B.allescomment.168ee2718.html">commentary</a>, by Richard Alles of Aquifer Guardians in Urban Areas and the Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance, warning of this attempt by some legislators to usurp the already limited power of Texas cities to regulate their own water quality and growth:</p><blockquote><p><em>

Sitting atop the Edwards Aquifer, one of the most precious and vulnerable water resources in the world, Central Texas cities have enacted rules that prevent contamination by inappropriate development. Some of these standards are hailed as the best in the country for balancing the needs of a growing community while preserving water supplies for future generations.
</em></p>

<p><em>
The problem is that no one has to comply because of state &quot;vested rights&quot; or &quot;grandfathering&quot; laws.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Not content that local water protection ordinances have applied to almost no development, state legislators seem determined to make sure no scratch of dirt or development fantasy remains without vested rights. Witness a profusion of bills that would radically expand what are already among the most developer-biased grandfathering laws in the nation.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Senate Bill 848, co-authored by Sen. Frank Madla, D-San Antonio, would allow developers to grandfather a project simply by dropping an incomplete application into a mailbox. Sen. Kenneth Armbrister, D-Victoria, has introduced SB 574, targeting tree preservation and park dedication ordinances. In addition, the legislation would exempt developers from impact fee increases and resurrect projects for which local permits have expired.
</em></p>

<p><em>
If you liked Pulte Homes' Encino Ridge clear-cut over the aquifer recharge zone, you will love these bills.
</em></p>

<p><em>
Developers claim the laws are needed to protect investments and prevent unfair rule changes while they are in the middle of a project. In reality, Texas has a law routinely exploited by landowners who have made no substantive investment in a project.
</em></p>

<p><em>
A San Antonio developer is suing the city claiming to be grandfathered back to 1927. Even though he hasn't turned a shovel of dirt in nearly 80 years, he claims to be exempt from all rules adopted in that time, including our stormwater drainage ordinance, which prevents him from flooding other peoples' property. Ironically, the same developer is suing the city over upstream development that is flooding his property.</em></p></blockquote><p>I have little clue what the prospects for these bills are, but given the GOP's dominance in the legislature, and that party's known affection for doing the bidding of large campaign contributors such as real estate developers, we should be extremely worried about these passing and act accordingly.&nbsp; Frank Madla, a Democrat mentioned as a co-author of one of these atrocious bills, and my state Senator, will be hearing from me, and hopefully from many others.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I am glad to hear that the San Antonio-to-Austin commuter rail idea has some life in it, as reported by the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA032505.2B.commuter_rail.16f58c97c.html">Express-News</a> today.&nbsp; It seems a no-brainer to me, and I've always been perplexed at the past (and no doubt present) vociferous opposition by some.&nbsp; I have no doubt that something of the sort will be built eventually, with the huge recent and projected population growth in the San Antonio-Austin corridor.&nbsp; (After all, even Dallas has commuter rail.)&nbsp; But it would be nice to get it done sooner rather than later.</p><blockquote><p><span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody"><p><em>

A decade ago, people might have thrown rocks at anybody suggesting there 
should be commuter rail running from San Antonio to Austin, local 
advocates of the idea say.</em></p>

<p><em>
But now, with a steady stream of cars and trucks on Interstate 35 that 
just keeps getting worse, people seem to be warming up to the 
possibility, said Tullos Wells, vice chairman of the Austin-San Antonio 
Intermunicipal Commuter Rail District.</em></p>
<p><em>
Wells marveled at the interest shown at nine public meetings held by the 
rail district this month to get input on the concept. More than 60 
people showed up at the last meeting, which was Thursday at Live Oak 
Civic Center.</em></p>
<p><em>
It's gone from not in my back yard to put it in my back yard,&quot; Wells 
said. &quot;That's what really surprised me — how much support there's been 
from Joe Average Citizen.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>
Some people are willing to fight to get a commuter rail station in their community.</em></p>
<p><em>
East Side activist Charles English said he's not happy that conceptual 
maps show the commuter route running west of downtown, with a potential 
station near the University of Texas at San Antonio Downtown Campus. 
He's believes it should go to the east, through Sunset Station where Amtrak's stop is.</em></p></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span class="vitstorybody">The current plan involves existing rail lines that currently are used by Union Pacific for freight trains, so, assuming those lines can be acquired, it is plausible that this could become a reality in the not-too-distant future.<br /><br />If you want to do some further reading about this, here is a recent <a href="http://herald-zeitung.com/story.lasso?wcd=12250">article</a> from the New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung, here is a recent <a href="http://www.cyburbia.org/forums/showthread.php?t=16507">discussion</a> (at a website that describes itself as an &quot;urban planning portal&quot;) about the current proposal, including the proposed map, and here is the website of the <a href="http://www.asarail.org/">Austin-San Antonio Inter-municipal Commuter Rail District</a> itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, here is a 2002 article from the <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2002-10-18/pols_atlarge.html">Austin Chronicle</a> that discusses some of the history of the Austin-San Antonio commuter rail proposals.&nbsp; That article pins much of the blame for delays on us in the San Antonio area, where traffic just isn't nearly as horrific as it is in Austin.<br /></span></p>

<p><span class="vitstorybody">UPDATE (3-28):&nbsp; Cincinnatus at <a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com/2005/03/austin-san-antonio-commuter-rail.html">The Jeffersonian</a> has some thoughts of his own on the commuter rail issue.<br /></span></p>

				<p>The Senate has <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;e=3&amp;u=/ap/20050316/ap_on_go_co/arctic_drilling">disgraced</a> itself and our nation today, voting to despoil one of our nation's last great wilderness areas for a few month's supply of oil.&nbsp; In the last few years, it has only been the Senate that has stood in the way of this happening.&nbsp; Not anymore.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Senate Votes to Allow Arctic Drilling</strong><br /><br />
WASHINGTON - 
Amid the backdrop of soaring oil and gasoline prices, a sharply divided
Senate on Wednesday voted to open the ecologically rich Alaska wildlife
refuge to oil drilling, delivering a major energy policy win for
President Bush.</em></p>

<p>
<em>The Senate, by a 51-49 vote, rejected an
attempt by Democrats and GOP moderates to remove a refuge drilling
provision from next year's budget, preventing opponents from using a
filibuster — a tactic that has blocked repeated past attempts to open
the Alaska refuge to oil companies.</em></p>

<p>
<em>The action, assuming Congress agrees on a
budget, clears the way for approving drilling in the refuge later this
year, drilling supporters said. </em></p>

<p>
<em>The oil industry has sought for more than
two decades to get access to what is believed to be billions of barrels
of oil beneath the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in the northern eastern corner of Alaska. </em></p>

<p>
<em>Environmentalists have fought such
development and argued that despite improve environmental controls a
web of pipelines and drilling platforms would harm calving caribou,
polar bears and millions of migratory birds that use the coastal plain.
</em></p></blockquote><p>I have none of my own words to express my dismay at this action by our alleged leaders.&nbsp; So I will turn to the immortal words of Wallace Stegner's &quot;<a href="http://www.wilderness.org/OurIssues/Wilderness/wildernessletterintro.cfm">Wilderness Letter</a>&quot; from 1960.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Something will have gone out of us as a people if we ever let the
remaining wilderness be destroyed; if we permit the last virgin forests
to be turned into comic books and plastic cigarette cases; if we drive
the few remaining members of the wild species into zoos or to
extinction; if we pollute the last clear air and dirty the last clean
streams and push our paved roads through the last of the silence, so
that never again will Americans be free in their own country from the
noise, the exhausts, the stinks of human and automotive waste. And so
that never again can we have the chance to see ourselves single,
separate, vertical and individual in the world, part of the environment
of trees and rocks and soil, brother to the other animals, part of the
natural world and competent to belong in it. Without any remaining
wilderness we are committed wholly, without chance for even momentary
reflection and rest, to a headlong drive into our technological
termite-life, the Brave New World of a completely man-controlled
environment. We need wilderness preserved--as much of it as is still
left, and as many kinds--because it was the challenge against which our
character as a people was formed. The reminder and the reassurance that
it is still there is good for our spiritual health even if we never
once in ten years set foot in it. It is good for us when we are young,
because of the incomparable sanity it can bring briefly, as vacation
and rest, into our insane lives. It is important to us when we are old
simply because it is there--important, that is, simply as an idea.</p>

<p>We are a wild species, as Darwin pointed out. Nobody ever tamed or
domesticated or scientifically bred us. But for at least three
millennia we have been engaged in a cumulative and ambitious race to
modify and gain control of our environment, and in the process we have
come close to domesticating ourselves. Not many people are likely, any
more, to look upon what we call &quot;progress&quot; as an unmixed blessing. Just
as surely as it has brought us increased comfort and more material
goods, it has brought us spiritual losses, and it threatens now to
become the Frankenstein that will destroy us. One means of sanity is to
retain a hold on the natural world, to remain, insofar as we can, good
animals. Americans still have that chance, more than many peoples; for
while we were demonstrating ourselves the most efficient and ruthless
environment-busters in history, and slashing and burning and cutting
our way through a wilderness continent, the wilderness was working on
us. It remains in us as surely as Indian names remain on the land. If
the abstract dream of human liberty and human dignity became, in
America, something more than an abstract dream, mark it down at least
partially to the fact that we were in subdued ways subdued by what we
conquered.</p>

<p>The Connecticut Yankee, sending likely candidates from King Arthur's
unjust kingdom to his Man Factory for rehabilitation, was
over-optimistic, as he later admitted. These things cannot be forced,
they have to grow. To make such a man, such a democrat, such a believer
in human individual dignity, as Mark Twain himself, the frontier was
necessary, Hannibal and the Mississippi and Virginia City, and reaching
out from those the wilderness; the wilderness as opportunity and idea,
the thing that has helped to make an American different from and, until
we forget it in the roar of our industrial cities, more fortunate than
other men. For an American, insofar as he is new and different at all,
is a civilized man who has renewed himself in the wild. The American
experience has been the confrontation by old peoples and cultures of a
world as new as if it had just risen from the sea. That gave us our
hope and our excitement, and the hope and excitement can be passed on
to newer Americans, Americans who never saw any phase of the frontier.
But only so long as we keep the remainder of our wild as a reserve and
a promise--a sort of wilderness bank.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Let me say something on the subject of the kinds of wilderness worth
preserving. Most of those areas contemplated are in the national
forests and in high mountain country. For all the usual recreational
purposes, the alpine and the forest wildernesses are obviously the most
important, both as genetic banks and as beauty spots. But for the
spiritual renewal, the recognition of identity, the birth of awe, other
kinds will serve every bit as well. Perhaps, because they are less
friendly to life, more abstractly nonhuman, they will serve even
better. On our Saskatchewan prairie, the nearest neighbor was four
miles away, and at night we saw only two lights on all the dark
rounding earth. The earth was full of animals--field mice, ground
squirrels, weasels, ferrets, badgers, coyotes, burrowing owls, snakes.
I knew them as my little brothers, as fellow creatures, and I have
never been able to look upon animals in any other way since. The sky in
that country came clear down to the ground on every side, and it was
full of great weathers, and clouds, and winds, and hawks. I hope I
learned something from looking a long way, from looking up, from being
much alone. A prairie like that, one big enough to carry the eye clear
to the sinking, rounding horizon, can be as lonely and grand and simple
in its forms as the sea. It is as good a place as any for the
wilderness experience to happen; the vanishing prairie is as worth
preserving for the wilderness idea as the alpine forest.</p>

<p>So are great reaches of our western deserts, scarred somewhat by
prospectors but otherwise open, beautiful, waiting, close to whatever
God you want to see in them. Just as a sample, let me suggest the
Robbers' Roost country in Wayne County, Utah, near the Capitol Reef
National Monument. In that desert climate the dozer and jeep tracks
will not soon melt back into the earth, but the country has a way of
making the scars insignificant. It is a lovely and terrible wilderness,
such as wilderness as Christ and the prophets went out into; harshly
and beautifully colored, broken and worn until its bones are exposed,
its great sky without a smudge of taint from Technocracy, and in hidden
corners and pockets under its cliffs the sudden poetry of springs. Save
a piece of country like that intact, and it does not matter in the
slightest that only a few people every year will go into it. That is
precisely its value. Roads would be a desecration, crowds would ruin
it. But those who haven't the strength or youth to go into it and live
can simply sit and look. They can look two hundred miles, clear into
Colorado: and looking down over the cliffs and canyons of the San
Rafael Swell and the Robbers' Roost they can also look as deeply into
themselves as anywhere I know. And if they can't even get to the places
on the Aquarius Plateau where the present roads will carry them, they
can simply contemplate the idea, take pleasure in the fact that such a
timeless and uncontrolled part of earth is still there.</p>

<p>These are some of the things wilderness can do for us. That is the
reason we need to put into effect, for its preservation, some other
principle that the principles of exploitation or &quot;usefulness&quot; or even
recreation. We simply need that wild country available to us, even if
we never do more than drive to its edge and look in. For it can be a
means of reassuring ourselves of our sanity as creatures, a part of the
geography of hope.</p></blockquote><p>UPDATE (2:07pm):&nbsp; Perhaps there is still some <a href="http://www.defenders.org/releases/pr2005/pr031605.html">hope</a> left for this particular part of the geography of hope.</p>

<p><em>The measure passed 4-1, paving the way for the city to negotiate with Wal-Mart on building a Supercenter at Scenic Loop and Bandera roads.
</em></p>

<p><em>...
</em></p>

<p><em>During the session, supporters and opponents in the chambers voiced opinions and accusations punctuated by calls for order from Hodges and shouts of &quot;No Wal-Mart&quot; from people packed outside the chambers. More than 100 stood outside, listening to the proceedings on a loudspeaker.
</em></p>

<p><em>Some of the 50-plus seats in the chambers were empty when the doors were closed before the meeting started. Bexar County Clerk and Helotes resident Gerry Rickhoff banged on one of the glass doors and yelled, &quot;This is wrong, people are waiting in the cold.&quot;
</em></p>

<p><em>Police officers asked him to back out of the chamber, but later, Rickhoff and others were allowed in to fill the remaining seats.
</em></p>

<p><em>Supporters were in the minority among speakers at past meetings, but were in the majority at Tuesday's meeting. They said Wal-Mart would increase Helotes' tax base and be a good partner in the community.
</em></p>

<p><em>Opponent Stuart Birnbaum, a member of the Helotes Heritage Association, a grass-roots organization dedicated to preventing urban sprawl, said the only true way to know how residents feel would be to put it to a vote.</em></p></blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.org/">Helotes Heritage Association</a> is livid:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>

Hodges shows true colors, lifts freeze</strong>
<br /><br /><strong>“WAL-MART FIGHT HAS ONLY BEGUN,” SAYS HELOTES HERITAGE</strong>

</em></p>

<p><em>The battle against Wal-Mart is not lost in Helotes. It has only begun in
earnest. Last night’s special City Council meeting made a sham of
democracy, leaving citizens literally out in the cold. Mayor Steve
Hodges and Councilman Charles James proved last night that Wal-Mart was
a “done deal” made in secret last summer, and that the “90-day”
moratorium was only a trick to defuse the opposition.</em></p>

<p><em>
“Only in Helotes is an Arkansas hog welcomed and the citizens scorned
as outsiders,” asserted John Eakin, a leader of the Helotes Heritage
Association, following last night’s confrontational meeting. “I wonder
if Hodges is running for mayor of Bentonville? Well, he'd better start
looking for a new position. We plan to ‘welcome’ Wal-Mart by
challenging every step of the approval process, staging protests and
rallies and bringing legal action against them.”</em></p>

<p><em>Fearing the mass swell of opposition among Helotes area residents,
Wal-Mart has stalled on closing on the Scenic Loop property, delayed
submitting a preliminary plat, and hired environmental consultants in
preparation for an environmental court challenge to their building
plans. 

</em></p>

<p><em>In the wake of last night’s meetings, Helotes Heritage Association has
already received a flood of emails at its website, phone calls,
donations and other offers of support from angry homeowners.
</em></p>

<p><em><strong>The battle has only begun!</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The Express-News article is strangely vague:&nbsp; it doesn't explain why much of the crowd was initially kept out of the city council chambers despite their being empty seats.&nbsp; And it doesn't make it clear at what point of the meeting that the seats were allowed to be filled.&nbsp; It also states that Wal-Mart supporters were in the majority of the speakers at this meeting, unlike past meetings.&nbsp; But what was the makeup of the total crowd?&nbsp; That is not described explicitly, but it does appear to have been dominated by Wal-Mart opponents.&nbsp; Hopefully, we'll get a more complete account of what happened in the coming days.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The actions of the current Helotes city council, both last night and earlier, stink royally, based on what I've read.&nbsp; I wish their challengers in the May election the best of luck.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>This is a crucial moment in the fight of Helotes-area citizens against a proposed Wal-Mart Supercenter in the heart of their small town on the outskirts of San Antonio's surging sprawl.&nbsp; This is only a few miles down the road from us, and in an area we are very familiar with, so I <a href="../../2004/11/walmart_scenic_.html">have</a> <a href="../../2004/12/more_on_texas_p.html">been</a> <a href="../../2004/12/helotes_heritag.html">watching</a> <a href="../../2005/01/belated_update_.html">this</a> <a href="../../2005/01/another_article.html">closely</a> over the last few months.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A few days ago, several Wal-Mart opponents <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA030905.1B.helotes_walmart.11c7dbe2c.html">announced</a> that they are running for city council in the May election.&nbsp; Now, suddenly, the current city council looks set to rush the project through.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/business/stories/MYSA031505.01B.Helotes_Wal-Mart.13b6edee8.html">San Antonio Express-News</a> today:</p><blockquote><p><em>Helotes residents who oppose a planned Wal-Mart are steeling themselves for a special meeting at which the City Council will consider canceling a 90-day hold on the project.

&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody"> <p>&quot;It really smells bad out here,&quot; said John Eakin, a member of the Helotes Heritage Association. &quot;They're rushing this thing through.&quot;</p>

 <p>At tonight's meeting, the council will vote on lifting the hold and entering into negotiations with the world's largest company.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody"><p>
The Heritage Association, formed in opposition to the construction of a 
Supercenter at Bandera and Scenic Loop roads, is posting a call to 
protest on its Web site, as well as using a time-honored small-town 
method.</p>
<p>
&quot;There's a pretty good grapevine in town, and the word gets around 
fast,&quot; Eakin said. &quot;I think it's going to be a little bit lighter than 
in the past because it's Spring Break.&quot;</p>
<p>
Hodges said he doesn't know which way the council will vote and that the 
special meeting wasn't rushed.</p>
<p>
&quot;We're getting the results of that (study) back,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it's 
time to look at those results, and make decisions on where we go from 
here.&quot;</p>
<p>
Jon Allan, a member of the association and a candidate for mayor, thinks 
the council was hoping to push the matter through after the May 
election, but that it was surprised by the three opposition candidates 
who filed two weeks ago.</p>
<p>
&quot;I met with Wal-Mart, and we've talked about alternative sites, and I 
found out last week that they actually tried to purchase a different 
site,&quot; Allan said. &quot;So my interpretation is the City Council's actually 
afraid they're going to go somewhere else and they don't want to lose 
the tax revenue.&quot;</p>
<p>
Wal-Mart officials did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>
Allan said he believes the city would be better off preserving its 
small-town atmosphere than collecting sales tax from the superstore.</p></span></span></p></span></span></em></p></blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.org/">Helotes Heritage Association</a> is asking, &quot;<span class="style30">Should backroom deals decide the fate of Helotes?&quot;:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>On March 10 at a City Council meeting, the Mayor of Helotes announced
that a special public meeting would be called to discuss/take action to
lift a recently imposed moratorium and negotiate with Wal-Mart for
development on the corner of Bandera and Scenic Loop Roads, an
environmentally sensitive area often called the gateway to the Hill
Country.&nbsp; This will be an important meeting that may well decide the future shape of our community. Every
one needs to be there.&nbsp; We must remind the Mayor and City Council that
we are serious in our opposition to big box development on Scenic Loop,
a historic and archaeologically rich roadway used for recreational
purposes by people throughout Bexar County.</em></p>

<p></p></blockquote><p><em><span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody"><p></p></span></span></em>On one of our local talk radio stations this morning (KTSA), I heard a short report on this matter that made it sound like this was a done deal.&nbsp; The report also stated that the traffic study indicated essentially no impact due to the Wal-Mart (which is extraordinarily hard to believe).&nbsp; As I recall, the reporter did not talk to Jon Allen, John Eakin, or anyone else from the Helotes Heritage Association.</p>

<p>The difficulty with this fight is that the citizens of Helotes and Bexar County have virtually no power in this matter.&nbsp; The land in question is immediately outside the Helotes city limits though apparently Helotes does control a small strip of that land.&nbsp; So Helotes' ability to regulate what happens on that land is doubtful.&nbsp; What about Bexar County?&nbsp; Apparently counties in Texas have no power to regulate ... period.&nbsp; Columnist Lynnell Burkett wrote about this in the Express-News on <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/columnists/stories/MYSA031305.2H.burkett.12616470f.html">Sunday</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>When citizens implored Bexar County commissioners to intervene, all the 
county could do was send Wal-Mart a letter asking them to choose another site.
<span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody">
<p>
&quot;After hearing their concerns, we agree that a massive commercial 
development on this site poses irreparable damage to their community's 
environment, historical fabric and quality of life,&quot; commissioners wrote 
to the company.</p>
<p>
Fat lot of good that will do. The county has absolutely nothing beyond 
its power of persuasion to affect the situation.</p>
<p>
And that illustrates the huge problem facing counties created in the 
19th century as they try to deal with 21st-century problems. </p>
<p>
It highlights the barrier that Texans face in controlling sprawl and 
saving not only the Hill Country but all scenic areas and a rural way of 
life in the state.</p>
<p>
When the state constitution created counties, they received no power to 
regulate — in other words, set standards for — development. That just 
wasn't a major problem in 1876.</p>
<p>
Although legislators have tried in recent sessions to grant some 
authority to counties, the bill has been killed each time.</p>
<p>
Because of urban sprawl, time is of the essence. As Comal County 
Commissioner Jay Millikin, an ardent supporter of regulatory authority 
for counties, told Express-News reporter Roger Croteau: &quot;At some point 
in time, in the not too distant future, it's going to be useless to 
Comal County. There won't be any farm- and ranch land left. It will all 
be subdivisions.&quot;</p></span></span></em></p></blockquote><p>Apparently some in our legislature are trying to remedy this situation.&nbsp; Burkett mentions Republicans Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in the state Senate and Carter Casteel of New Braunfels in the state House.&nbsp; They deserve our support, as they will need all the help they can get.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>As you may already know, current and former female Wal-Mart employees have been engaged in a lawsuit against the giant retailer, accusing the company of gender discrimination in pay and promotion.&nbsp; Last year, the case was granted <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2004/06/23/cx_da_0623topnews.html">class action</a> status and thus became a real threat to Wal-Mart's bottom line and a potential boon to those battling gender discrimination throughout the country.</p>

<p>Now (as <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/laborblog/archive/002300.shtml">Nathan Newman</a> points out), <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_12/b3925088.htm">Business Week</a> writes that Wal-Mart's current defense against this lawsuit is to challenge the constitutional legitimacy of nation-wide class action suits themselves:</p><blockquote><p><em><span class="text" face="arial,helvetica,univers"> Wal-Mart's ambitious
legal strategy strikes at the heart of what it means to file a class
action. The company maintains that its constitutional rights would be
violated if the court allows a suit to go forward involving up to 1.5
million of the retailing giant's current and former female employees.
Because such a case would deprive the company of its rights to defend
itself against each woman's claim, it argues, the courts should allow
suits only on a store-by-store basis. If the Ninth Circuit agrees and
strikes down the multistate action certified by a lower court, it would
likely kill the largest employment class action in U.S. history. More
broadly, it would open wide the door for all large companies to make
similar arguments. &quot;A victory for Wal-Mart might mean that plaintiffs
can't bring nationwide class actions anymore and that they might have
to do them locally or regionally,&quot; says Mark S. Dichter, a
management-side employment lawyer at Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius LLP.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Business Week goes on to point out that this seems like a long-shot strategy for Wal-Mart.&nbsp; But with the current makeup of the Supreme Court, nothing is guaranteed.&nbsp; This is worth keeping a close eye on, especially since ramifications of a negative decision would extend far beyond the worthy realm of fighting gender discrimination.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp?Id=1661">Chris Mooney</a> lets us know that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee deadlocked in a 9-9 tie on George Bush's Cloudy Skies initiative, which I wrote about in some <a href="../../2005/02/cloudy_skies.html">detail</a> a few weeks ago.&nbsp; GOP Senator Lincoln Chafee joined Independent Jim Jeffords and seven Democrats to put a temporary halt on this anti-environmental bill.</p>

<p>According to this informative Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20314-2005Mar9.html">article</a>, Cloudy Skies isn't dead yet, though it doesn't explain exactly how the GOP may be able to still yet bring it to the Senate floor.</p>

<p>An interesting tidbit from the article is that the committee chairman's (Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma) dismissive&nbsp; attitude toward global warming may be doing a lot to push Senator Chafee away from the administration's side on this issue, at least according to one of the bill's main proponents in the Senate:</p><blockquote><p><em><p>A central disagreement was whether the bill, originally aimed at reducing sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury pollution, should
also address global warming and carbon dioxide emissions. The issue
cost the Republican majority Chafee's crucial vote, said Sen George V.
Voinovich (R-Ohio).</p></em></p>

<p><em><p>
&quot;Chafee thinks this is the biggest problem facing the world, and the
chairman [Inhofe] has a sign in his office saying this is a hoax,&quot; said
Voinovich, as he threw up his hands today.</p></em></p></blockquote>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Hans Bethe died on Sunday at the age of 98.&nbsp; Bethe has been an ancient, eminent figure in physics since I was a kid, and, given his great longevity and his continued scientific activity, it always seemed like he would hang around forever.&nbsp; So for this professionally-trained astrophysicist and lifetime science enthusiast, it is a sad moment.&nbsp; I never met him personally, but I did have the good fortune to hear him give a colloquium presentation at Caltech back in the early 1990s when I was a graduate student.&nbsp; It was like watching a living legend.</p>

<p>Obituaries are all over the papers, but <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-sci-bethe8mar08,0,5245350.story?coll=la-home-obituaries">this one</a> in the Los Angeles Times is particularly good.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.atomicarchive.com/Bios/BethePhoto.shtml"><img width="90" height="102" border="0" src="../../images/bethe1_1.jpg" title="Bethe1_1" alt="Bethe1_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>His scientific and societal contributions were immense, but the one that stands out to me is that this is the guy who figured out the details of how the Sun shines.&nbsp; The Sun, source of all the energy that warms our planet and fosters the multitude of life forms it contains.&nbsp; Scientific problems do not come more basic and fundamental than that.</p><blockquote><p><em>Bethe was introduced to the problem at the 1938 Washington Conference
on Theoretical Physics, where astronomers speculated that perhaps
nuclear reactions were involved.<br /><br /> He went back to his office at
Cornell University after the meeting and within six weeks had solved
the problem. Given the known temperature of the core of the sun — about
20 million degrees Celsius (about 36 million degrees Fahrenheit) — and
the proportions of carbon, hydrogen and other elements in its interior,
he deduced which nuclear reactions could be responsible for its
radioactive fire.<br /><br /> He ultimately developed a six-step cycle in
which carbon and nitrogen atoms act as catalysts for the conversion of
four hydrogen nuclei (protons) into one helium nucleus. The very slight
mass lost in the process is converted into large amounts of energy,
according to Albert Einstein's famous equation, E = mc2. <br /><br />
Bethe later remarked with typical modesty that he found the answer by
&quot;looking through the periodic table [of elements] step by step. So you
see, this was a discovery by persistence, not by brains.&quot;<br /><br /> One
oft-told story about Bethe recounts the evening after he discovered the
secrets of starlight. During a late-night stroll, his fiancee, Rose —
daughter of theoretical physicist Paul Ewald — remarked on how
beautiful the stars looked. He responded: &quot;Yes, darling, and I'm the
only one on Earth who knows how they do it.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Yet as brilliant as Bethe was, and as encyclopedic as his knowledge of nuclear physics was, this was not a problem he solved on his own.&nbsp; And, as such, it is a great illustration of how real science actually works the vast majority of the time.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://mt.sopris.net/mpc/sci/laws.html"><img width="90" height="103" border="0" src="../../images/bethe2_1.jpg" title="Bethe2_1" alt="Bethe2_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>The stage was set for him to come in and work it out, but it took a lot of work to get that stage in order.&nbsp; As far as I know, Bethe was not a crucial figure in the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.&nbsp; That was accomplished by many other brilliant minds, including those of Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Enrico Fermi, and Paul Dirac.&nbsp; Bethe was not the fellow who surmised that nuclear reactions were the power source for the Sun.&nbsp; That was <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/sun_3.html">accomplished</a> by Sir Arthur Eddington in 1920, based on experimental work by F. W. Aston and theoretical work of Albert Einstein.&nbsp; Bethe also was not the first to quantitatively study nuclear reactions with quantum mechanics.&nbsp; That was <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/sun_4.html">accomplished</a> by George Gamov and others, just as Hans Bethe was starting his long career in physics.&nbsp; Bethe didn't even discover one of the crucial nuclear reaction cycles that powers some stars, the CNO cycle.&nbsp; That was <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/sun_4.html">done</a> by C. F. von Weizsäcker.</p>

<p>What Bethe did do was use all of this previous work to meticulously, quantitatively demonstrate for the first time which specific nuclear reactions occur in the centers of stars, and how the rates of these reactions vary with the mass and temperature of the star.&nbsp; As theoretical astrophysicist John Bahcall writes in an excellent <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/index.html">article</a> on the history of how the problem of the Sun's energy source was solved:</p><blockquote><p class="normaltext"><em>By April 1938, it was almost as if the scientific stage had been intentionally set for the entry of <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1967/index.html">Hans Bethe</a>, the acknowledged master of nuclear physics. Professor Bethe had just completed a classic set of three papers in which he reviewed and analyzed all that was then known about nuclear physics. These works were known among his colleagues as &quot;Bethe's bible.'' Gamow assembled a small conference of physicists and astrophysicists in Washington, D. C. to discuss the state of knowledge, and the unsolved problems, concerning the internal constitution of the stars.</em></p>

<p class="normaltext"><em>In the course of the next six months or so, Bethe worked out the basic nuclear processes by which hydrogen is burned (fused) into helium in stellar interiors. Hydrogen is the most abundant constituent of the sun and similar stars, and indeed the most abundant element in the universe.</em></p>

<p class="normaltext"><em>Bethe described the results of his calculations in a paper entitled &quot;Energy Production in Stars,'' which is awesome to read. He authoritatively analyzed the different possibilities for reactions that burn nuclei and selected as most important the two processes that we now believe are responsible for sunshine. One process, the so-called <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/sun_pp-chain.html">p-p chain</a>, builds helium out of hydrogen and is the dominant energy source in stars like the sun and less massive stars.</em></p>

<p class="normaltext"><em>The CNO cycle, the second process which was also considered by von Weizsäcker, is most important in stars that are more massive than the sun. Bethe used his results to estimate the central temperature of the sun and obtained a value that is within 20% of what we currently believe is the correct value (16 million degrees Kelvin)<sup>&nbsp;</sup>. Moreover, he showed that his calculations led&nbsp; to a relation between stellar mass and stellar luminosity that was in satisfactory agreement with the available astronomical observations.</em></p></blockquote><p>Yet even after Bethe's 1938 work, which won him the <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1967/">Nobel Prize</a> for Physics in 1967, the problem of how stars shine was not completely solved.&nbsp; For one thing, Bethe apparently <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/sun_pp-chain.html">missed</a> a couple of the reactions involved.&nbsp; And also, he was even completely wrong on one point.&nbsp; In the <a href="http://fangio.magnet.fsu.edu/~vlad/pr100/100yrs/html/chap/fs2_05032.htm">abstract</a> to his seminal paper that Bahcall refers to above, Bethe wrote:</p><blockquote><p><em>It is shown further that </em>no elements heavier than He-4 can be built up in ordinary stars<em>. ......&nbsp; The heavier elements found in stars must therefore have existed already when the star was formed.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.astrosociety.org/membership/awards/01winners.html"><img width="90" height="100" border="0" src="../../images/bethe3.jpg" title="Bethe3" alt="Bethe3" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>But in fact, it was later learned that the &quot;<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/energy/triplealph.html">triple alpha</a>&quot; process (three helium nuclei colliding virtually simultaneously to fuse into a carbon nucleus), contrary to Bethe's initial claim, can occur, if only in the late stages of a star's life, when it is a red giant and the central temperature climbs from the tens of millions of degrees (Celsius) into the hundred of millions of degrees.&nbsp; So elements heavier than helium are indeed built up in ordinary stars.&nbsp; It is a good thing, too, because otherwise, there would be no carbon, oxygen, iron, etc, and what would we be made out of then?</p>

<p>Hans Bethe, a scientific giant, standing on the shoulders of other scientific giants, will be missed.</p><blockquote><p><em>Whether or not their governments respond to their advice, scientists
have an obligation to speak out publicly when they feel there are
dangers ahead.</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; —Hans Bethe</p></blockquote>
