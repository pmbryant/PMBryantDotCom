				<p><a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm"><img class="image-full" alt="Iandthebirdlogoolive_1" title="Iandthebirdlogoolive_1" src="../../../photos/uncategorized/iandthebirdlogoolive_1.jpg" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Welcome to the third edition of the blog carnival for bird lovers, <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm">I and the Bird.</a>  It is a great honor for me to host this, especially since, while I am indeed a bird lover, I am not a particularly skillful bird watcher.  But I enjoy birds greatly.  Yes, even those I do not know exactly what they may be called because they don't seem to match up with anything in my field guide.  And even those that I can't get a decent look at because they're flitting about in that dense brush so close, yet so far.  Finally, after many years at it, I think I have a good understanding of which species birds live in and around our backyard and even know a fair amount of their behavior.  It's been a slow process.  </p>

<p>Take me far out of this immediate area, however, and I am back to being a beginner.  Of course, the great thing about that is that there's always new birds to see, and new bird behavior to learn.  </p>

<p>In addition to watching birds, I also enjoy reading about the experiences of other bird lovers, from those who are occasional indulgers in birding like myself, to those who are expert amateurs, to those who are professionals.  The previous editions of "I and the Bird" have been a great way to discover such writings.  The submissions for this new edition follow in the excellent, if short, tradition of the first two.</p>

<p>This birding carnival, in the way that I am comfortable with, starts out very close to home.  <br />
<ul><li>Aydin Örstan at <a href="https://snailstales.blogspot.com/">Snail's Tales</a> writes about how he used a couple common backyard birds who showed up on his deck to benchmark his hearing, in '<a href="https://snailstales.blogspot.com/2005/06/cardinals-at-limit-of-my-hearing.html">The Cardinals at the limit of my hearing</a>.'</li><br />
<li>Nuthatch at <a href="http://nuthatch.typepad.com/ba/">bootstrap analysis</a>, expounds upon the habits of a small, gregarious bird that accompanies her in the garden throughout the summer in '<a href="http://nuthatch.typepad.com/ba/2005/07/an_exuberant_bi.html">an exuberant bird in a plain brown wrapper</a>.'</li><br />
<li>Yours truly wrote about my experience last year at finally, and unexpectedly, sighting an <a href="../../2005/08/elusive_bird.html">elusive bird</a> whose nighttime call has been a comforting presence every spring for the last six years.</li><br />
<li>Clare Kines at <a href="http://kiggavik.typepad.com/the_house_other_arctic_mu/">The House & other Arctic musings</a> tells us about the different types of seagulls that inhabit his part of the world.  Read '<a href="http://kiggavik.typepad.com/the_house_other_arctic_mu/2005/07/gulls.html">Gulls</a>', so that next time you spot a seagull, you can say, "Look!  A glaucous gull."</li><br />
<li>Mike at <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/">10,000 Birds</a> reports on a birding excursion away from home, but in a part of the world he visits regularly in order to burn a giant chicken.  Or something like that.  Read '<a href="http://www.10000birds.com/july2005.htm#7/27/05">Birds Of Chicken Inferno 2005</a> for a full explanation&#151and also to see a picture of the "gigantic galliform" itself.</li></ul>Moving on, the carnival travels into the domain of surveys.  I have some experience with this, having participated in a few bird surveys myself, as well as the Great Backyard Bird Count.<ul><li>Unlike Duncan at <a href="http://dcfraser.customer.netspace.net.au/blogger.htm">Ben Cruachan Blog</a>, however, I do not have experience with parrots.  (Except for that recent charming movie about the guy in San Francisco.)  Duncan writes about his parrot (and other bird) counting experience along the southern coast of Australia in '<a href="http://dcfraser.customer.netspace.net.au/2005/07/parrot-arithmetic.html">Parrot arithmetic</a>.'</li><br />
<li>Tony G at <a href="https://milkriver.blogspot.com/">milkriverblog</a>, just up the road here in central Texas, reports on the results of a recent, and rather unique, survey of his own in <a href="https://milkriver.blogspot.com/2005/05/env-wakeup-calls.html">Wakeup Calls</a>.</li></ul>Next, the carnival moves into the quest for rarities, a popular pursuit amongst many birders, but one I have yet to try out myself.<ul><li>John at <a href="https://dendroica.blogspot.com/">A DC Birding Blog</a> sets out on a local expedition to spot two reported species not normally found in his environs this time of year.  To find out what he was looking for and whether he found it, read '<a href="https://dendroica.blogspot.com/2005/07/sultry-evening-twitch-report-on.html">A Sultry Evening Twitch</a>.'</li><br />
<li>A British blogger at <a href="https://bogbumper.blogspot.com/">bogbumper</a> reports on a couple of rare, spectacular birds in Britain that attracted quite a crowd before an unfortunate ending.  For details, read '<a href="https://bogbumper.blogspot.com/2005/07/day-bee-eaters-got-eaten.html">The day the Bee-eaters got eaten</a>.'</li></ul>What would a bird carnival excursion be without the chance to see a hawk eat a meal?  (Not the bee-eaters, fortunately!)  Today we have double the fun.<ul><li>First, the illustrated version, including action shots, from Rexroth's Daughter at <a href="https://newdharmabums.blogspot.com/">Dharma Bums</a>, who has a whole sequence of pictures in her post '<a href="https://newdharmabums.blogspot.com/2005/07/hawk-gets-lunch.html">A Hawk Gets Lunch</a>.'</li><br />
<li>Next, the narrated version from Birdchick at <a href="http://www.birdchick.com/blog.html">Birdchick Blog</a>.  As she describes in <a href="http://www.birdchick.com/2005/07/first-blood-at-bird-store.html">First Blood at the Bird Store</a>, this particular hawk may have been a novice at his work.</li></ul>After that lunch break, it's time to get up-close and personal with the next group of birds.<ul><li>Dave at the <a href="https://birdtlc.blogspot.com/">Bird Treatment and Learning Center</a> in Anchorage, Alaska relates the story of a hero of a bird in '<a href="https://birdtlc.blogspot.com/2005/08/quality-time-with-one-wing-ol-witch.html">Quality Time with One Wing & Ol' Witch</a>'.  It is about his encounter with an eagle whose will to live not only helped him survive devastating injuries suffered in the infamous Exxon Valdez oil spill, but also helped save the lives of numerous other eagles also injured in the spill.</li><br />
<li>Jason at <a href="http://www.beakspeak.com/">Beakspeak</a> treats us with some spectacular shots of hummingbird babies growing up in his posts <a href="http://www.beakspeak.com/archive/2005/06/13/the_humm.shtml">The Hummingbird Chronicles</a> and <a href="http://www.beakspeak.com/archive/2005/06/21/the_humm.shtml">The Hummingbird Chronicles: An Update</a>.  He even got a short video of one as it was on the verge of learning to fly.  Don't miss it!</li></ul>Finally, we get to explore the more personal side of birding.<ul><li>Charlie Moores at <a href="http://www.charliesbirdblog.com/">Charlie's Bird Blog</a> explores the question of why he devotes much of his scarce spare time to watching these small, flying creatures in a post entitled 'How in a rambling conversation I get to see why I go birding'.  (There is no link directly to the post, so if you encounter this at some future date, go to his blog and either scroll down or look in his archives.)</li></ul>And so the third edition of '<a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm">I and the Bird</a>,' with all its multi-media glory, comes to a close.  Yet the fourth edition, which will be hosted at <a href="https://milkriver.blogspot.com/">milkriverblog</a>, is only two weeks away.  Please send your submissions to either <a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e38e8a8886a3d2d3d3d3d3818a918790cd808c8e">Mike</a> at 10,000 Birds or <a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#87eff2f5f5eee4e6e9e2f3e0c7efe8f3eae6eeeba9e4e8ea">Tony G</a> at milkriverblog on or before Tuesday, August 16.  I am looking forward to the next edition already!<br />

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2005/08/elusive_bird.html">A loud, elusive, comforting bird</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Every spring, each day as the sun drops below the horizon, the call starts.  A low, soft, clicking sound, rapidly followed by a loud multi-pitched, three-part whistle.  It is unmistakeable.  It is the sign of the chuck-wills-widow&#151the odd name of the bird derived from its distinctive call.  </p>

<p>We've heard that bird&#151sometimes more than one&#151for several months every night of every spring in each of the six springs we have lived in our current house.  As the sky gets dark, the call starts out, seemingly tentative, at relatively low volume and infrequent intervals.  As darkness creeps in, the call gets more insistent, growing louder, repeating every few seconds.  Someone clearly wants to be heard.  And this goes on for hours.  Occasionally I would emerge outside in the middle of the night only to hear the bird still repeating that call endlessly.  As the Texas summer approaches, the call comes less frequently until at some point it ceases.  I do not know exactly when that is, as in the Texas summer, we are not out in the backyard so often.  After all, it's kind of hot here then.</p>

<p>Despite all this commotion over all these years, I have never seen the bird.  I know from field guides that it is not a small creature, as it is larger than the scrub jays that frequent our yard during the daytime, occasionally scaring off the smaller songbirds.  But the chuck-wills-widow is exquisitely camouflaged.  During the daytime, you would practically have to step on one to see it, I suspect.  And at night, when it is active, well, it's dark.</p>

<p>Ok, it's not quite true that I have never seen the bird.  I did see it once, albeit not well.  In the spring, a year ago.  </p>

<p>A couple years earlier I had gotten curious one night and tried to fight through the cedar-covered lots surrounding our house to find out approximately where this bird lived.  But after pushing through a few dozen feet, I realized the call wasn't getting appreciably louder.  Clearly, this bird, which sounded so close, was not quite as close as I thought.  So I gave up, not too disappointed since I found its constant presence comforting and didn't want to disturb it.</p>

<p>But then that day a bit over year ago, the call was literally booming in my ears one night.  The sun had set perhaps 45 minutes earlier, but there was still a small amount of light in the sky.  After deafening me for a short while, the call would stop for a minute, then resume booming in my ears, but from a bit further to the right.   Now, he <i>really</i> had to be close.  It just couldn't sound this loud and not be within a few dozen feet.  Or could it?  It had already fooled me once.  So I decided to try to find out, by inching around the yard extremely slowly.  </p>

<p>I had no hope of seeing anything.  There was barely any light left.  I merely hoped to triangulate the sound to estimate where the bird was located.  Even this would be difficult, though, since, unusually, the sound of the call was moving around frequently&#151every minute or two.  For several minutes I inched around, changed directions to follow the sound, inched around some more, and so on.  Then, with the bird temporarily silent, I emerged into a clearing at the edge of a small dirt road about 100 feet behind our house.  Then the call started again.  Louder than ever.  So ear-splittingly loud that I knew it had to be directly across the road from me, barely 10 feet away.  </p>

<p>I froze.  Finally, I believed I knew where the bird was, even if I couldn't see it.  For the first time in four years of listening to that chuck-wills-widow, I could say that.  And I must say, the volume of that bird's call was extremely impressive.  I had never fully appreciated that before.  </p>

<p>But my luck was about to get even better, for after a minute or so, as was its pattern that day, the bird decided to spare my ears and move further away.  When it did so, as it took off, it emerged into a 3-foot wide trail cut through the dense cedar and I saw the bird's silhouette against the sky ever so briefly before it disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<p>I had not expected to ever see that bird.  But it had briefly revealed itself to me.  And I was thrilled.</p>

				<p>Events of various sorts have prevented me from posting much of anything the last 10 days.  I haven't even followed the news much, so I suspect I'm way behind on a few things.</p>

				<p>The second edition of the blog carnival for birders, <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm">I and the Bird</a>, is out&#151published at <a href="http://www.charliesbirdblog.com/">Charlie's Bird Blog</a> this week.</p>

<p>Take a trip over there to learn, among other things, about those hard-to-figure-out <a href="https://thomasburg-walks.blogspot.com/2005/06/little-brown-birds-part-2.html">little brown birds</a> called sparrows from Pamela Martin in Thomasburg, Ontario.  And also about the slow-but-sure recovery of the <a href="http://www.beakspeak.com/archive/2005/06/27/flight_o.shtml">California condor</a> from Jason at Beakspeak.</p>

<p>My own experience with sparrows is probably typical of <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/july2005.htm#7/6/05">(bad)</a> birdwatchers.  I'm good at picking out Chipping Sparrows, since they swarm our backyard feeders in the winter, but everything else is a blur.  Except for Lark Sparrows, of course, but they are special, and I don't get to see them very frequently.  (And never in my backyard, alas.)</p>

<p>As for condors, I've never seen one.  Back when I lived in southern California, the recovery program was just starting to re-release them into the wild.  And I was totally ignorant of birds at the time.  But I have been following their recovery ever since that time, and hope to get a chance to see one the next time I'm out West.  That may be a while, unfortunately.</p>

<p>What is definite, though, is that this blog has the honor of hosting the third edition of <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm">I and the Bird</a> in two weeks.  So, as Charlie says, send your submissions to either <a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#caa7a3a1af8afbfafafafaa8a3b8aeb9e4a9a5a7">Mike</a> of 10,000 Birds or <a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e393869786918e81919a828d97a3908180848f8c81828fcd8d8697">me</a> by Tuesday, August 2nd.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2005/07/newman_on_rober.html">Newman on Roberts:  an optimistic take</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Labor lawyer <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/003234.shtml#more">Nathan Newman</a>, whose views on Supreme Court issues I have come to place deep trust in over the last couple years,  has posted his thoughts about John Roberts, Bush's Supreme Court nominee.  He comes away with an optimistic attitude (emphasis his).<br />
<em><blockquote>I've actually had a chance to read through Roberts' hearings when he was up for the Court of Appeals and I have to admit I feel (relatively) more hopeful. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>[T]he most likely possibility is that he won't be surprising and here's my bet on how he will perform from the evidence.   <strong>In general, he will be less of a judicial activist than O'Connor in both bad ways but also potentially good ways.</strong></p>

<p>Where there is no constitutional issue, he will unquestionably interpret statutes in a conservative manner, and where there is ambiguity in a statute, I am sure that Roberts will likely always take the interpretation that favors corporate and rightwing interests.  But O'Connor was no different as a dependable vote for business interests.  </p>

<p>But reading his decisions and his statements in the hearings, <strong>Roberts really does seem to believe in deferring to elected government, which is probably not surprising for someone who spent so much of his career representing governments</strong> arguing on behalf of courts not overriding their power.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>So to the extent that Roberts sticks to these principles, he will be a conservative Justice but not one that will use his thirty years on the bench to block a lot of progressive legislation from the bench.</strong></p>

<p>Again, he may be a raving activist lunatic beneath the hood, but on the evidence he may be exactly what Bush says he is, a judge who won't legislative from the bench.  If that's the compromise that Dems have extracted through the threat of a filibuster, I'll take that as a small victory.</blockquote></em></p>

<p>If Newman's optimistic analysis ends up being correct, then that is far more than a small victory.  That is a giant leap.  (Though it's sad that keeping the court about the same ideologically, when it is already quite conservative, is such a great victory.)</p>

<p>Newman points out that he still thinks Democrats should filibuster Roberts, presumably due to reasons he gave in a post <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/003231.shtml">yesterday</a> (emphasis his again):<br />
<em><blockquote><strong>So if his career is one of years of political hack partisanship, sprinkled with a few years acting as a well-paid hack on behalf of corporate interests, why should we believe Roberts has the temperment to be an independent Justice?</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>If the words Roberts wrote for all his clients don't reflect work upon which he should be evaluated, then the two years on the bench is too little experience to be confirmed.  </p>

<p><strong>And if all John Roberts can say is, sorry, I've been a partisan hack for twenty-five years, so I don't have any vision that I can talk about -- well, that's not good enough either and he should be rejected.</strong> </blockquote></em></p>

<p>Hopefully the confirmation hearings will shed more light on which of these interpretations of Roberts, if either, is the correct one.</p>

				<p>Bush's selection of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/20/politics/20cnd-judge.html?ex=1279512000&en=f93c7ad5e913caf8&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">John Roberts</a> for the Supreme Court should not be a surprise.  In the use of his power, Bush really only cares about two things: his cronies and his favorite corporations.  John Roberts represents both of those, in <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/John_G._Roberts_Jr.">abundance</a>, having been a loyal Republican apparatchik and corporate lawyer for his whole career.  </p>

<p>Ok, Bush also cares about a third thing, if only out of necessity:  not pissing off the fundamentalist crowd too much.  That ruled out Alberto Gonzales for now.  I suspect he'll get another chance though.  </p>

<p>As could be expected, Bush's nominee's history gives every indication that he will be a protector of Big Money and Big (secret) Government at the expense of the average citizen of this country.  I hope to hear differently during the confirmation hearings.  But I don't expect to.</p>

				<p>Cernig at <a href="https://cernigsnewshog.blogspot.com/2005/07/can-we-end-hype-now.html">NewsHog</a> thinks that Bush shouldn't fire anyone unless they are convicted of a crime.  Convicted.  Not accused.  Not even indicted.  Convicted.<br />
<em><blockquote>But it has to be said, if the roles were reversed the Democrats would insist on a conviction before firing a high-placed aide too. Not an allegation, however well it was backed by evidence, not a criminal charge even - a conviction.</blockquote></em></p>

<p>Recent history, however, demonstrates this charge is utterly wrong.  In fact, history shows that administrations of both parties, up until the current one, got rid of problematic aides routinely.  Typically, all it took was solid evidence of unethical behavior.  Not even indictments.</p>

<p>In the mid-stages of Watergate, Nixon axed <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/watergate/articles/050173-1.htm">numerous</a> White House aides and other political appointees who had not been indicted, including both of his chief advisors, Haldeman and Ehrlichman.  Early in the last Democratic administration, Clinton's close advisor <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/white_house/april97/hubbell_4-2.html">Web Hubbell</a> resigned from a top Justice Department job while facing a criminal investigation, prior to any indictment or conviction.</p>

<p>It hasn't even taken a major criminal scandal to force the resignation of White House aides.  G.H.W. Bush's chief of staff, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0207.green.html">John Sununu</a>, was "forced out after he was found to have used a government vehicle to attend a rare-stamp convention."</p>

<p>Furthermore, as far as <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2001/0207.green.html">Democrats</a> go:<em><blockquote>In 1993, for example, Roger Altman, the deputy Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton, was forced to resign after failing to fully disclose the number of contacts between the White House and Treasury over Whitewater. Shortly thereafter, David Watkins, a White House administrator, resigned a day after it came to light that he had taken a government helicopter to play golf. </blockquote></em></p>

<p>And going back a bit <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0828745.html">further</a>:<blockquote><em>[Bert Lance] was one of Jimmy Carter's closest advisers during the 1976 presidential campaign. After the election, Carter appointed him Director of the Office of Management and Budget. However, allegations of financial irregularities in his management of the Calhoun (Ga.) National Bank and another Georgia bank forced his resignation later in 1977.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>The idea that only a conviction should be enough to force someone out of public office is completely off-base.  It is only the current administration that feels itself so above reproach that the only way anyone will ever be held accountable is if they are convicted in a court of law.  The idea that Democrats would act the same way, or even that different Republicans would act the same way, is demonstrably false.</p>

<p>Cernig also thinks the Rove/Wilson/Plame affair is overhyped.  I disagree.  As others, including New York Times columnist <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0717-20.htm">Frank Rich</a>, have pointed out, that the big picture of this issue is not about Rove, Wilson, or Plame.  It is about an administration that used deception to lure this country into an "ill-conceived" war and then has relentlessly tried to cover up its deceit by attacking those who attempt to uncover it, possibly even to the exent of breaking the law and endangering national security in the process.  That is not hype.  That is a big deal.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>It's after 2 AM here in Texas, and I see two new articles on the Rove/Plame affair in the new day's papers.  The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/15/politics/15rove.html?ex=1279080000&en=8389b1a301900a63&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">New York Times</a> report is based on an anonymous source friendly to Karl Rove.  It says:<blockquote><em>Mr. Rove has told investigators that he learned from the columnist the name of the C.I.A. officer, who was referred to by her maiden name, Valerie Plame, and the circumstances in which her husband, former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, traveled to Africa to investigate possible uranium sales to Iraq, the person said. </p>

<p>After hearing Mr. Novak's account, the person who has been briefed on the matter said, Mr. Rove told the columnist: "I heard that, too."<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/15/AR2005071500036.html">Washington Post</a> has a similar story, but based on a lawyer "who has firsthand knowledge of the conversations between Rove and prosecutors."  It says:<blockquote><em>At the end of that 15- or 20-minute call, according to the lawyer, Novak said he had learned that Wilson's wife worked for the CIA.</p>

<p>"I heard that, too," Rove replied, according to the lawyer, confirming the [New York] Times account. The Times article reports that Rove learned about Plame from Novak, but the lawyer with firsthand knowledge of the case said Rove was not certain of that.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>This conversation, according to the Times, took place on July 8, 2003.  Three days before Rove revealed Plame's CIA job to Matt Cooper of Time magazine, and six days before Novak's Chicago Sun-Times column officially outing Plame was published.</p>

<p>Daily Kos has a handy <a href="http://www.dkosopedia.com/index.php/Plame_Leak_timeline">timeline</a> of the whole Wilson/Plame/Rove affair.  July 8 was two days after Joe Wilson's original New York Times op-ed attacking the Bush administration appeared, and one day after the White House was forced to retract its earlier allegation that Iraq had sought uranium from Niger.</p>

<p>According to the timeline, on July 8 the following happened:<blockquote><em>A friend informs Wilson that Robert Novak believes that his wife had something to do with Wilson's appointment to investigate the Yellow Cake claim in Africa.</em><blockquote>He asked Novak if he could walk a block or two with him, as they were headed in the same direction; Novak acquiesced. Striking up a conversation, my friend, without revealing that he knew me, asked Novak about the Uranium controversy. It was a minor problem, Novak replied, and opined that the administration should have dealt with it weeks before. My friend then asked Novak what he thought about me, and Novak answered: "Wilson's an asshole. The CIA sent him. His wife, Valerie [Plame], works for the CIA. She's a weapons of mass destruction specialist. She sent him."</blockquote><em>Wilson's friend went right to Wilson's office and documented the exchange.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>So someone told Novak about Plame's true occupation on or before July 8.  As we learned today, Rove's conversation with Novak was on July 8.</p>

<p>If we believe the Rove-friendly account in today's papers, someone had already spread around Plame's CIA job to both Novak and Rove.  Who?  Rove, by the account in the Washington Post, has conveniently forgotten.  </p>

<p>If we don't believe the Rove-friendly account, then this timing is extremely suspicious.</p>

<p>UPDATE (10:22 AM):  I cross-posted this last night at <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/7/15/31151/4679">TPMCafe</a>.  In that version substitute 2003 for my late-night "1993".</p>

       <div class="entry-inner">
					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2005/07/kelo_revisited.html">Kelo revisited</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In trying to explain why the Supreme Court decision in the recent <em><a href="../../2005/06/judicial_activi.html">Kelo</a></em> eminent domain case was wrong, Express-News columnist <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/columnists/jgurwitz/stories/MYSA071305.7B.gurwitz.6147fcdd.html">Jonathan Gurwitz</a> illustrates why it was right.</p>

<p>He starts off lauding Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's vociferous dissent:<blockquote><em>Judicial opinions are often dry and pedantic exercises in jurisprudence. O'Connor's dissent in Kelo, however, is a clear warning for all American citizens and a wake-up call for lawmakers in state capitols and in Washington.</p>

<p>"Under the banner of economic development," O'Connor writes, "all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgraded — i.e., given to an owner who will use it in a way that the legislature deems more beneficial to the public."<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>In contrast to Gurwitz, I see this much-publicized statement of O'Connor's as overly alarmist and misleading, as if the <em>Kelo</em> decision represented a great departure from previous use of eminent domain.  For many decades, governments have had the power to seize private property from  individuals, with "just compensation," and then do as they wish with it, including handing it over to other individuals.  All that was needed was the say the magic word "blight," as <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_06/006581.php">Kevin Drum</a> pointed out a few weeks ago:<blockquote><em>[T]he definition of "blighted" has been pretty elastic for a long time. In Los Angeles, the poor-but-not-especially-blighted Chavez Ravine was condemned in the early 50s for a public housing project, but eventually the land was turned over to Walter O'Malley in order to build the privately owned Dodger Stadium. Similarly, in the early 90s, the Texas legislature created a special agency for the sole purpose of condemning land in Arlington so that the city could build a sparkling new stadium for George Bush's Texas Rangers. The Rangers were given control over the stadium and its surroundings plus an option to buy it later at a sweetheart price.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>So the <em>Kelo</em> decision didn't change anything fundamental.  On the contrary, if the Supreme Court had ruled as O'Connor would have liked, they would indeed have changed something very fundamental.  They would have usurped the power to decide what is an appropriate public use away from the representatives of the people.</p>

<p>Despite his praise for O'Connor's alarmist views on this decision, Gurwitz apparently recognizes that it made some sense.  Further down, he says:<br />
<blockquote><em>Writing for the majority, [Justice] Stevens allows, "Nothing in our opinion precludes any State from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings power." While [Justice] O'Connor correctly sees this as an abdication of the Supreme Court's responsibilities, it does offer a legislative way out of this public takings wilderness.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Despite his instinctual unease, Gurwitz does appear to get the basic point of the majority decision:  "a legislative way out."</p>

<p>Exactly!</p>

<p>Amazingly, Gurwitz concludes by actually shooting down O'Connor's alarmist opinion.  Although I am not sure he realizes he is doing so.<blockquote><em>As O'Connor succinctly notes, "Nothing is to prevent the State from replacing any Motel 6 with a Ritz-Carlton, any home with a shopping mall, or any farm with a factory." </p>

<p>Nothing, that is, other than the ability of elected officials to correct the opinion of five Supreme Court justices.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>I would have put it as "Nothing, that is, other than the ability of elected officials to fulfill their responsibility to the public, as our system of government is designed."  But I'll take what I can get.  He's on the right track.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The San Antonio Express-News published  an <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/stories/MYSA071305.6B.rove1ed.613fc377.html">editorial</a> about the Karl Rove/Joe Wilson/Valerie Plame affair yesterday that does what Bush doesn't want the media to do.  It "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302343.html">prejudges</a>" the investigation by Justice Department special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald.  How does the editorial board know that "Rove is unlikely to be criminally culpable because there is no evidence that he intentionally leaked her name"?</p>

<p>Beyond that, the editorial board seems peculiarly anxious about the political consequences for the administration and oblivious to the larger criminal, ethical, and national security concerns.  "The political problem ... is substantial," they write.  "The way the president handles this will have a huge impact on his credibility for the remainder of his second term."</p>

<p>All true, of course.  But what about the criminal concerns?  Fitzgerald, who has a reputation as a straight-shooting prosecutor, has been investigating this case for a long time now.  We don't know where he's going with this, but there's clearly something there.  </p>

<p>What about the ethical concerns?  High-level administration officials sabotaging the career of a critic's wife by blowing her cover to at least half a dozen members of the press, either through malice or through willful ignorance.  Is everything permissible when it comes to attacking someone perceived to be a political troublemaker?</p>

<p>What about the national security concerns?  The CIA operations whose cover was blown were on issues of weapons of mass destruction.  This act could have repercussions that endanger the lives of not just CIA operatives that worked with Plame, but of people all over the world.</p>

<p>The Express-News editorial board concludes by writing:<blockquote><em>The best interest of the administration must supercede the best interest of Rove if the two diverge.<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>What about the best interest of the country?</p>

<p>UPDATE (7-21-2005):  I sent a variant of this post as a letter to the editor of the San Antonio Express-News.  Today, they <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/letters/stories/MYSA072105.1O.EDletters.2166675.html">published</a> it.<br />
