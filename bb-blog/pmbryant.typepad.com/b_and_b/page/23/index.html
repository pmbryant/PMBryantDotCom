			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The NASA press office scandal rolls on, with yet more revelations about misdeeds over the last couple years.</p>

<p>Bush flunkies in the NASA press office have apparently been trying to suppress Earth science reports ever since the Presidential election of 2004, according to yesterday's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/16/science/16nasa.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">New York Times</a>.  Apparently they must have thought that too much news on pollution and global warming&#151;or should I use the NASA press office's preferred term of 'climate change'&#151;might have a negative effect on their patron's political standing.<blockquote><em>Top political appointees in the NASA press office exerted strong pressure during the 2004 presidential campaign to cut the flow of news releases on glaciers, climate, pollution and other earth sciences, public affairs officers at the agency say. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In a conference call with colleagues in October 2004, the colleagues said, [Gretchen Cook-Anderson, in charge of managing the flow of Earth science news at NASA headquarters] said that Glenn Mahone, then the assistant administrator for public affairs, had told her that a planned news conference on fresh readings by a new NASA satellite, Aura, that measures ozone and air pollution, should not take place until after the election.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>[A]rchives of news releases on the NASA headquarters Web site show a sharp change in the number of such releases, to 12 in 2005 from about four dozen in 2004, a figure that had helped lead to the pressure to cut back.</em></blockquote>Meanwhile, the Bushies have another way to cut back on the flow of Earth science news besides using their press office thugs.  But we already knew about this tactic&#151;slash its funding!</p>

<p>House Science Committee Chair Sherwood Boehlert (R-NY) said yesterday at the <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=19655">hearing</a> on NASA's budget (emphasis mine):  "I am extremely uneasy about this budget, and I am in a quandary at this point about what to do about it. This budget is bad for space science, <strong>worse for earth science</strong>, perhaps worse still for aeronautics."</p>

<p>Committee member Mark Udall (D-Co) <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=19648">added</a>:<blockquote><em>"The situation facing the space and Earth sciences is equally troubling. More than a billion dollars was removed last year from the budgetary runout for space and Earth science that had been in the FY 2005 NASA outyear budget plan. An additional $3.1 billion is removed from the runout in this year's budget request.<br />
 <br />
So just two years after OSTP director Marburger lauded the "robust" science program that would be undertaken if the [Moon-Mars] exploration initiative were approved, we have seen more than $4 billion taken out of NASA's space and Earth science accounts."</p>

<p>One of the most inexplicable aspects of those cuts is NASA's plan to cut between $350 to $400 million from research and analysis funding over the next five years. As you may know, that is the funding that helps develop the next generation of scientists and engineers at our nation's universities.</em></blockquote>Hopefully this bipartisan viewpoint in Congress will help repel the Bush forces and save NASA's Earth science programs for the future.  They had some <a href="../../2005/06/glory_is_saved.html">success</a> last year.  What will happen this year?</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2006/02/uresti_v_madla_.html">Uresti v Madla:  Overview of a Texas Democratic primary bloodbath  </a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There is a heated Democratic primary campaign going on for the state senate district that encompasses my neck of the woods.  The long-time incumbent, Frank Madla, is being challenged by state representative Carlos Uresti.</p>

<p><img alt="District19map_1" title="District19map_1" src="../../../photos/uncategorized/district19map_1.gif" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" />This <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/mt/archives/2006/01/4040_get_to_kno_6.html">district</a> is geographically huge.  (Here's a <a href="http://www.senate.state.tx.us/Icons/Dist_Maps/Dist19_Map.pdf">map</a>.)  It contains much of southern and western Bexar County, a broad finger into my area of northwest Bexar County, and a vast expanse of sparsely-populated west Texas&#151;practically all the way to El Paso, several hundred miles away.  Despite that great rural and desert expanse, nearly half the voters of the district reside in the San Antonio metropolitan area.</p>

<p>A couple months back, upon hearing of Uresti's challenge to Madla, I <a href="../../2005/12/uresti_v_madla.html">asked</a> for more information to help me make up my mind who to support and vote for.  Sure enough, the local blogging community has come through, providing extensive coverage of this race.  (No doubt they wouldn't have bothered if I hadn't asked.  Right?)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.carlosuresti.com/"><img alt="Uresti_2" title="Uresti_2" src="../../images/uresti_2.png" width="105" height="51" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a><a href="http://www.frankmadla.com/index.html"><img alt="FrankMadla" title="Madla" src="../../images/madla.jpg" width="150" height="49" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>In particular, San Antonio bloggers Matt at <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/">Just Another Blog</a>, Cincinnatus at <a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com">The Jeffersonian</a>, and Eddie at <a href="http://theredstate.com/">The Red State</a> have posted repeatedly about events in the Uresti-Madla battle.  Joining them has been Houston blogger Charles Kuffner at <a href="http://offthekuff.com/">Off the Kuff</a> and the Austin group blog <a href="http://burntorangereport.com/">Burnt Orange Report</a>, which published interviews of both candidates in late January.</p>

<p>This has been an extremely negative campaign, virtually right from the start in December.  The rationale for Uresti's run is that Madla has not represented the people of his district well and not been a good Democrat.  Uresti's supporters, which include all of the blogs mentioned above (I have not seen a pro-Madla blog), have not been shy in tearing down Madla's recent record.  </p>

<p>And neither has Uresti himself, who stated in the opening of his interview at <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/mt/archives/2006/01/4040_an_intervi_2.html">Burnt Orange Report</a>:  "On too many bills, Frank crossed the aisle to vote with Republican leadership to balance our state’s budget on the backs of those who could least afford it. He became more interested in helping powerful special interests while kids went without health insurance, elderly people lost nursing home allowances, and state employee ranks were decimated for the benefit of a few big private interests. Frank’s votes were a slap in the face to me as a Texas Democrat, as a fellow legislator, and as a resident of the district he represents. I live where those children go without medical care. I see the results of his votes. I could have waited a few more years until he finally retired, but I don’t think the vulnerable constituents in his district can."</p>

<p>What are the specific charges against Madla?</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest issue Uresti's supporters have with Madla's record is Madla's tendency to allow harmful legislation introduced by the GOP leadership to advance through early stages of the legislative process when he has the power to kill it.  One bill, in particular, has raised their ire, as alluded to by Uresti in his statement above.  </p>

<p>Officially known as House Bill 2292, it was passed by the legislature in 2003, privatizing many of the state's human services functions at no net savings and cutting off many thousands of people from Medicaid and CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program.  Madla voted against the bill in the end, but apparently voted with Republicans on earlier procedural votes that could have stopped the bill in its tracks.</p>

<p>Madla's defense?  In a January article in the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA011206.01B.MadlaUresti.1772a09d.html">San Antonio Express-News</a>, he is quoted as saying, "I voted against final passage of HB 2292, and I was among those who fought for, and helped to restore, previous cuts in health and human services as quickly as were able to do so."  He also said, "I believe that I was elected to serve all of the citizens of Texas and primarily those who reside in the district I represent, not just those of one party or the other."</p>

<p>In his January interview at <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/mt/archives/2006/01/4040_an_intervi_5.html">Burnt Orange Report</a> (BOR), Madla said, "It is my observation that, for major legislation, it is best to allow the process to move forward with hopes that resolutions for the most problematic issues will be developed. When the end product did not seem to do that, I did not support the bill in its final form. As to the eventual verdict on privatization, the jury is still out on that."</p>

<p>This is clearly a recurring theme with Madla.  Last spring, I <a href="../../2005/04/state_sen_madla.html">wrote</a> that "State Sen. Madla has a lot of explaining to do," after he took actions that allowed a pro-development, anti-local-regulation bill to advance through the legislative process despite his stated misgivings.  He voted against this bill (SB 848) in the end, but his earlier actions had allowed it to reach a final vote (where it passed by a depressingly large margin).</p>

<p>Uresti feels differently about how a legislator should behave when confronted with poor bills, telling BOR, "My time in the House also taught me this about the legislative process: some bills must be blocked and killed when you have the chance. Moving a bad bill 'through the process' just builds momentum that can’t be stopped in the end."</p>

<p>Another of the principal complaints against Madla is that he is too close to the Republicans in Austin.  Uresti's supporters highlight the fact that several GOP legislators and lobbyists are amongst Madla's supporters in his re-election bid.</p>

<p>None other than Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst was a <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/006635.html#006635">featured guest</a> at a fundraiser for Madla last month.  Two former aides to Governor Rick Perry and a former state senator, present lobbyist, and author of the aforementioned HB 2292, Arlene Wohlgemuth, also were listed as <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2006/01/wohlegemuth_red.html">attendees</a> at that fundraiser.</p>

<p>Madla's defense is that he's a bi-partisan kind of guy.  While some Republicans support him, so do plenty of Democrats.  The <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA021406.3B.notebook.d535f05.html">Express-News</a> wrote earlier this week, "Several Democratic heavyweights turned out Monday to vouch for [Madla's] bona fides, endorsing him at a media conference at the Menger Hotel. They included former Mayor Henry Cisneros, County Commissioner Tommy Adkisson, City Councilman Richard Perez, Constable Ruben Tejeda and Madla's Senate colleague, Leticia Van de Putte."  </p>

<p>Madla told BOR, "In the Senate, you have to be able to work with both sides of the aisle, and I've learned to do that with both moderate and conservative Republicans. Doing so does not mean that you have to give up your values or your party allegiance and loyalties, but you learn how to work together for the good of the whole state and for your own district."  He claims that as a result of his bi-partisan skills, he passed 68 bills last year.</p>

<p>Uresti's supporters counter that other prominent Democrats oppose Madla and support Uresti.  The most celebrated of these is a state senator from El Paso named <a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com/2006/01/conscience-of-senate-endorses-carlos.html">Elliott Shapleigh</a>, who has said, "The first vote that the (Senate) Republicans go to get is Frank Madla's."</p>

<p>The most recent, and most sensational, complaint against Madla arose out of the very fundraiser that sparked the above complaint.  He was filmed <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/02/frank-madla-doesnt-like-bloggers.html">saying</a>, "When I get to the state Capitol, I lock the Democratic Party in my trunk."  So the charge is that Madla not only is too close to the GOP establishment in this state, but that he doesn't respect his own political party.</p>

<p>Madla's defense here is that Uresti is running a campaign of dirty tricks, although the Uresti campaign denies that the person who taped the event worked for them.</p>

<p>Madla, on the other hand, is not above some tricks of his own.  A supporter of his managed to get an <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/01/frank-madla-buys-good-press_31.html">elementary school</a> named after Madla just as the primary campaign was starting to heat up.</p>

<p>So, after watching and reading about all this over the last few weeks, I have some definite ideas on how to vote come the March primary, though I have not yet made a final decision.  The charges against Madla that have been echoing around the Texas blogosphere in recent days appear damning on the surface, and Madla's own clumsy choice of words at the January fundraiser reinforces them.  But his staunch support from so many prominent Texas Democrats indicates that there is more to the story.</p>

<p>In addition, the anti-Madla rhetoric occasionally ventures into the realm of the absurd, risking tainting the credibility of the justifiable criticism.  Perhaps the most emphatic Uresti supporter amongst Texas bloggers, Eddie of The Red State recently <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2006/02/madlas_lies_and.html">wrote</a>, "[Madla] hates poor children, the elderly, the sick and the disabled. Now, he hates the Republicans who gave him ten of thousands of dollars. He can't have it both ways."  I greatly respect Eddie's work at The Red State, but such unbelievable statements are not going to convince anyone who is still on the fence.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, back when Uresti first announced, Eddie <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2005/12/carlos_uresti_t.html">wrote</a>, "Am I bias on this race? Hell yeah. I have worked for [Uresti] and believe in him from personal experience."  This is an angle I'd love to hear more about.</p>

<p>Large chunks of <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA020906.05B.Uresti_Donor.b5b4858.html">money</a> are flowing in to both sides of this fight, so it is likely to be very competitive.  Unfortunately, all the acrimony may make it hard for Democrats to unite behind the victor.  Given that Bush won a slight majority in the district in <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/par_rpts/current/senate/dist19/r8.htm">2004</a>, the general election may not be a sure bet for the Democratic candidate.</p>

<p>Early voting starts on Tuesday, February 21 (only five more days!), while the official primary day is Tuesday, March 7.</p>

<p>For those who want to learn more besides what's available at the links above, <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/02/senate-district-19-full-story.html">Matt</a> has an excerpt from a detailed rundown of this race from the (subscription only) Quorum Report.

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My last two non-birding posts were about two seemingly unrelated subjects:  the attempt by Texas billionaire Red McCombs to install <a href="../../2006/02/point_man_on_bu.html">Mark Rey</a> at the helm the U.S. Forest Service so that he can build a huge ski resort in Colorado, and the attempt by Texas elected officials to quietly build a huge system of <a href="../../2006/02/toll_roads_in_t.html">toll roads</a> that may not be either wanted or needed by the population of this state.</p>

<p>But it turns out there is a connection after all.  And it's right on the surface.  His name is Tom Loeffler.</p>

<p>Loeffler was the fellow McCombs turned to for help in getting Bush to appoint Mark Rey to his current position overseeing our national forests.  And Loeffler's law firm&#151lobbying firm more like it&#151;is the first private industry board of directors representative listed on the San Antonio Mobility Coalition's <a href="http://www.samobilitycoalition.org/aboutUs.htm">web site</a>.  (The San Antonio Mobility Coalition is one of the state-government-created organizations responsible for driving the toll road plans to completion.)</p>

<p>Loeffler is described in the Denver Post article on McCombs and Rey as a former Republican Congressman from Texas, a current lobbyist, and "a top fundraiser for Bush."  According to Texans for Public Justice, he has a long and sordid <a href="http://www.tpj.org/docs/pioneers/pioneers_view.jsp?id=28">history</a> in Texas politics, much of it closely connected with that former governor who now resides in the White House.</p>

<p>Amidst the circle of GOP powerbrokers, lobbyist Loeffler clearly is near the very center.  And guess who he is getting behind now, according to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/02/14/mccain.tm/">Time magazine</a> last week:<blockquote><em>None of [Senator John] McCain's new allies are more impressive than former Congressman Tom Loeffler of Texas, a mega--fund raiser for Bush. Loeffler says he has told McCain he is willing "to be your bottle washer, or I'll fix the flat on the Straight Talk Express bus." While Loeffler notes that he has been "very, very, very close friends" with McCain since the 1970s, he says McCain is finding new chums among the same Republicans who invested so much to keep him out of the White House six years ago. "The battle of 2000 is far behind," Loeffler says, "and they are looking for a winner in 2008."</em></blockquote>Keep this in mind come the next Presidential election.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2006/02/a_freaky_chippi.html">A freaky chipping sparrow</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>While glancing out the window into our backyard last week, a member of the B and B team spotted a bird she had never seen before.  It looked and acted like a sparrow, foraging around in the drought-parched remnants of our lawn, but it was very pale&#151practically white.  Nothing she was familiar with, and certainly nothing I was familiar with either.</p>

<p>Fortunately, her quick thinking resulted in a few photographs.<br />
<a href="../../../photos/uncategorized/mystery1zz.jpg"><img class="image-full" alt="Mystery1zz" title="Mystery1zz" src="../../../photos/uncategorized/mystery1zz.jpg" border="0"  /></a>&nbsp;<a href="../../../photos/uncategorized/mystery2zz.jpg"><img class="image-full" alt="Mystery2zz" title="Mystery2zz" src="../../../photos/uncategorized/mystery2zz.jpg" border="0"  /></a></p>

<p>Upon seeing the first picture, I threw out the idea that this was some kind of "freaky house finch."  Later, we noticed the small size relative to a Northern Cardinal in one of the pictures.  That would be make it too small even for a freaky house finch.  Then I noticed the solid gray breast, which reminded me of the chipping sparrows that so often visit our yard in huge flocks.  With the information, and photographic confirmation, that, indeed, this bird was hanging out with, and acting just like, the <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Chipping_Sparrow.html">chipping sparrows</a>, we changed our amateur diagnosis to "freaky chipping sparrow."</p>

<p>A bird-expert friend of ours suggested this is likely what is known, more formally, as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucistic">leucistic</a> bird.  It is lacking much of the pigment that gives its cousins their normal coloration.</p>

<p>It's been a few days and we haven't seen this odd-colored sparrow again yet.  Given his bright white topside, I suspect he may have been relatively easy prey for a hawk, owl or some other predator.  He blends in quite well with the gravel in our garden, as in the pictures above.  But amongst the brown, dry grass that the sparrows love to hang out in, this bird would stand out dramatically, while his compatriots would be nearly invisible.  </p>

<p>But we'll keep an eye out hoping to see it again.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The state government has been trying to foist toll roads on the citizens of Texas behind their backs.  As the plans become clear to more and more people, however, the opposition grows louder and stronger.  The issue is likely to play an important role in the state elections later this year.  </p>

<p>Carlos Guerra has an article in today's San Antonio Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA021206.01B.guerra.2ec1f8d.html">summarizing</a> the situation:<blockquote><em>It has taken awhile for people to understand what elected — and unelected — officials have planned for them, which is why only now are the Texas Department of Transportation's toll-road plans coming under intense fire. </p>

<p>When Gov. Rick Perry unveiled the Trans Texas Corridor, I warned that it could turn into a huge boondoggle. But few readers responded, and some called me an alarmist. And even in late 2004, Texas Transportation Commission Chairman Ric Williamson said that "in your lifetime, most roads will have tolls," and Time magazine asked if our state's plans weren't "a Big, Fat Texas Boondoggle." But only a few more people wrote in. </p>

<p>Recent columns about toll roads in the far North Side, however, triggered waves of e-mails from all over Texas expressing strong opposition to tollways and anger that voters are powerless to stop them. </p>

<p>"Why don't they put it out in the marketplace of ideas?" asked one. "If (toll roads) are really that great, people will vote for them." </p>

<p>It won't happen. While radically changing how Texas builds roads, lawmakers decided that road building is too important to let those who pay for them have a say. </p>

<p>TxDOT will turn some existing roads into tollways, and add toll lanes to other existing roads. You will have zip to say about it, or about plans for 4,000 miles of new toll roads — with railway and utility easements — that will be built on state land handed to private investors. The Trans Texas Corridor will take 584,000 acres of land in quarter-mile-wide swaths at a cost of an estimated $183.5 billion. </p>

<p>These projects are well on their way. But only now are many realizing that the "small" tollway proposals close to them are not isolated, one-of-a-kind projects, but part of a bigger scheme. Controversies are erupting throughout Texas, and very diverse constituencies are coalescing in opposition. Their only recourse may be at the ballot box, however.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Later, Guerra asks some fundamental questions:  "Can anyone explain how building more highways over the Edwards Aquifer recharge zone will not increase the chances of catastrophic spills? And why is there such a rush to build more highway miles when both San Antonio's and Austin's commute times are still way below the national average?"</p>

<p>He also suggests an answer.<blockquote><em>Check that group's Web site [San Antonio Mobility Coalition], and you will see that its membership is a veritable who's who of big construction interests. Could it be that these projects are more about fat construction contracts than about improving transportation?</em></blockquote></p>

<p>So we can all check out this suggestion, here is that <a href="http://www.samobilitycoalition.org/aboutUs.htm">web site</a>.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2006/02/point_man_on_bu.html">Point man on Bush's public lands sale beholden to real estate developer</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Former timber industry lobbyist, current Undersecretary of Agriculture overseeing the U.S. Forest Service, Mark Rey, looks to be the point man on President Bush's new plan to <a href="../../2006/02/new_public_land.html">sell off public lands</a>.  The primary beneficiaries of such a sale would no doubt be real estate developers.</p>

<p>So it is quite interesting to find out that Rey appears to be beholden to at least one major real estate developer&#151;one who happens to be based right here in San Antonio:  <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_3474870">B. J. "Red" McCombs</a>.  The Denver Post reported last week:<blockquote><em>Texas billionaire B.J. "Red" McCombs, who wants the U.S. Forest Service to let him build a huge ski village atop a southwestern Colorado pass, lobbied to get the official who oversees the agency appointed, and McCombs and his allies have since met repeatedly with the official to discuss the controversial project, records and interviews show. </p>

<p>McCombs and his partner pushed to have Mark Rey, a longtime timber-industry lobbyist, appointed undersecretary of agriculture, overseeing the Forest Service.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The project is opposed by many local residents, environmentalists and even by the owners of the ski area, who have sued McCombs. </p>

<p>U.S. Rep. John Salazar, D-Colo., who represents the area in Congress, also is opposed. <br />
Michele Ames, spokeswoman for the ski-hill owners, said their position "has been all along that they've been supportive of some kind of development. The issue has become the size of the development. ... It strikes at the lifeblood of the ski hill." </p>

<p>In order to build his project, known as Village at Wolf Creek, McCombs needs Forest Service permission to build a 250-foot road across federal land so visitors can reach his property from the nearby highway.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>McCombs is a San Antonio car dealer who co-founded Clear Channel Communications, the nation's largest radio company. He's bought and sold basketball's Denver Nuggets and football's Minnesota Vikings. </p>

<p>He is a longtime donor to Republicans and a friend of the family of President Bush. He's given more than $475,000 to congressional and presidential campaigns since 1989, 91 percent of it to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. </p>

<p>McCombs and his associates have been pushing some version of the ski-village plan since the 1980s. When Bush took office in 2001, McCombs saw an opportunity to help get a friendly official placed over the Forest Service, which would decide his access- road request, records indicate. </p>

<p>According to a letter from [McCombs' main spokesman and development partner, Bob] Honts to McCombs provided by ski-area attorneys, McCombs lobbied for the appointment of Rey to the Bush administration post that controls the Forest Service. </p>

<p>McCombs tapped for help former U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler, R-Texas, now a Texas lobbyist and a top fundraiser for Bush. </p>

<p>It's not clear whom McCombs and Loeffler approached on Rey's behalf. But after Rey was selected, Honts wrote a letter to McCombs regarding Rey's appointment. </p>

<p>"It is my understanding that your effort and former Congressman Leffler's efforts had an impact at exactly the right time in the process," said Honts' letter, which misspelled the representative's name, regarding the lobbying effort for Rey. "Obviously, the team effort worked." </p>

<p>In an interview, Honts acknowledged the lobbying campaign. He said he and McCombs backed Rey because "we were advised by people who'd been working for Village at Wolf Creek that he's a very good guy."</p>

<p>After Rey's appointment, Honts got access to him at key steps in the process of reviewing the Village at Wolf Creek proposal, according to Rey's calendars, obtained by The Post.</em></blockquote>A fascinating article that contains much, much more&#151;exposing yet another link in the culture of corruption amongst Republicans who run our federal government.</p>

<p>Right now, we can only imagine what underhanded machinations lie behind the surface of this new public lands sale, proposed by Bush, and run by friend-of-billionaire-real-estate-developers Mark Rey.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In my <a href="index.html">earlier post</a>, I said that the Bush administration's rationale for their new proposal to sell-off public lands was not worth mentioning.  But for the sake of completeness, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-bush-land-sale,1,1070898.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines">here</a> it is:<blockquote><em>Forest Service officials say the sales are needed to raise $800 million over the next five years to pay for schools and roads in rural counties hurt by logging cutbacks on federal land.</em></blockquote>Notice, however, that this money is only required because the Bushies are eliminating the current source of that money, as reported in the <a href="http://www.duluthsuperior.com/mld/duluthsuperior/news/politics/13807072.htm">Duluth News Tribune</a> a few days ago:<blockquote><em>The Bush administration proposed Monday phasing out a program that has pumped more than $2 billion into rural states hurt by logging cutbacks on federal land.</p>

<p>The plan would cut in half payments made to rural counties in 41 states and Puerto Rico for schools, roads and other infrastructure needs. The six-year-old "county payments" law has helped offset sharp declines in timber sales in western states in the wake of federal forest policy that restricts logging to protect endangered species such as the spotted owl.</p>

<p>Agriculture Undersecretary Mark Rey, who directs U.S. forest policy, called the proposal painful but necessary in a tight budget year. Rey said the 2000 law was designed to help rural counties make the transition from dependence on timber receipts to a more broad-based economy.</p>

<p>"We've had six years of it now. We're proposing another five years," he said, calling the plan "an extension of a program that was never intended to be permanent."</p>

<p>Western lawmakers said the proposal amounted to a death knell for a law that many described as the most successful federal forestry initiative in decades.</p>

<p>"Governing is about priorities, and this proposal to cut funding to rural counties by 50 percent tells rural Oregon that we're not very high on the administration's priority list," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. "The administration found billions to fund subsidies for energy company boondoggles, so I have trouble believing they couldn't find the money to maintain support for rural counties."</em></blockquote>Former timber industry lobbyist and renowned anti-environmentalist Mark Rey claimed the previous program to fund rural schools was never intended to be permanent.  Is the sell-off of public lands intended to be permanent?</p>

<p>For more on the dismal details, see this devastating <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/editorials/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/113935832197450.xml&coll=7">editorial</a> published by the Oregonian on Wednesday:  "Swinging a budget ax at Oregon's timber towns:  The president's plan to slash county payments will injure rural communities and reignite public land conflicts."</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2006/02/climate_scienti.html">Climate scientist Hansen trying to do for NOAA what he did for NASA</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Is there another batallion of George Deutsch's hidden away in the bowels of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration?  Climate scientist James Hansen, whose actions led to the unveiling of the NASA press office scandal over the last couple weeks, suggests that there may be.  The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/10/AR2006021001766.html">Washington Post</a> reports in their Saturday edition:<blockquote><em>James E. Hansen, the NASA climate scientist who sparked an uproar last month by accusing the Bush administration of keeping scientific information from reaching the public, said Friday that officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are also muzzling researchers who study global warming.</p>

<p>Hansen, speaking in a panel discussion about science and the environment before a packed audience at the New School university, said that while he hopes his own agency will soon adopt a more open policy, NOAA insists on having "a minder" monitor its scientists when they discuss their findings with journalists.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>After the panel discussion -- which also featured Princeton University professor Michael Oppenheimer, American Enterprise Institute fellow Steven Hayward and Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich -- Hansen said he knows of NOAA scientists who are chafing at the administration's restrictions but are afraid to speak out.</em></blockquote>Obviously, I do not know what lies behind Hansen's allegations.  But last August, Chris Mooney wrote <a href="http://scienceg8.com/more-bush-admin-press-release-games/">two</a> <a href="http://scienceg8.com/press-releases-take-ii/">posts</a> about a what he believed was a mysterious lack of press releases from NOAA for "cutting edge" climate research that they were funding.</p>

<p>Not long after that, and about a month after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, <a href="http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Commerce_Department_tells_Nationa_1004.html">Raw Story</a> reported that NOAA, which is the parent agency of the National Weather Service, was insisting that all media contact by employees be pre-approved.<blockquote><em>The Department of Commerce has issued a blanket media policy to employees of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), requiring that all requests for contact from national media be first approved by the Department, RAW STORY has learned.</p>

<p>According to a leaked Sept. 29 email memo sent out to NOAA staff, including employees of the National Weather Service (NWS) -- both of which are under the Department of Commerce -- employees must collect information from reporters and forward it to the Department.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>“Prior to this policy change, if a media organization called our office (or any other National Weather Service office) and wanted an interview, we would do our best to accommodate the request as quickly as possible,” said one NOAA employee who requested anonymity. “While often such requests are from local media, local offices do get requests from national media if a weather event is big enough to be a national story.”</p>

<p>The policy requires that local weather offices forward media requests to the NWS press office, who in turn would forward the request on to the Commerce Department’s public relations office. The Department would then decide whether comment should be granted.</p>

<p>Under this new policy, the Department, rather than the weather agencies, would also determine who would then provide comment.</p>

<p>“There has been no explanation as to why this policy was issued. It does appear the intent of this policy is to restrict the flow of weather information to the national media,” said the NOAA employee who also expressed concern over why Commerce is suddenly making blanket policy decisions for the NWS and deciding who can speak to the media.</em></blockquote>Hansen's earlier comments about the problems at NASA jump-started the process to help straighten up how that premier government science agency treats its public communications.  It looks like Hansen is now trying to do the same for another such agency.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Scarecly a <a href="../../2005/12/congress_public.html">few weeks</a> after a national furor resulted in the abandonment of a plan by Republican Reps. Richard Pombo of California and Jim Gibbons of Nevada to sell off public lands to private interests, now the Head GOP Honcho himself wants to do the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-bush-land-sale,1,1070898.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines">same thing</a>.<blockquote><em>The Bush administration on Friday detailed its proposal to sell more than 300,000 acres of national forests and other public land to help pay for rural schools in 41 states. </p>

<p>The land sales, ranging from less than an acre to more than 1,000 acres, could total more than $1 billion and would be the largest sale of forest land in decades.</em></blockquote>The rationale is not worth mentioning, as it is so transparently false.  The real desire is simply to start the process transferring the public's assets into the hands of friends of the GOP leadership.  Pombo and Gibbons failed, so now Bush has to step in to get the ball rolling again.<blockquote><em>"These are not the crown jewels we are talking about," [former timber industry lobbyist and current Agriculture Undersecretary Mark] Rey said in an interview.</em></blockquote>They figure as long as they don't sell the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and Yosemite that the public won't care.  Fortunately, the reaction to the Pombo-Gibbons plan at the end of last year suggests they are wrong.<blockquote><em>BLM spokeswoman Celia Boddington said much of the land would be near urban areas with high market value. In recent years, the government has sold parcels for tens of millions of dollars in Nevada, for example, she said. </p>

<p>"Lands formerly remote are now abutting metro areas. That is certainly the case in New Mexico, Arizona and Utah," she said. </p>

<p>Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said that is precisely the reason the land should not be sold.</p>

<p>"Our hunters, anglers, campers and other recreational users benefit from -- and depend on -- access to public lands," Bingaman said. "In my view, selling public lands to pay down the deficit would be a shortsighted, ill-advised and irresponsible shift in federal land-management policy."</em></blockquote>Bingaman's words are too understated.  Open land near population centers is exceptionally valuable the way it is, and will only get more so in the future.  Selling it off now will only benefit the real estate developers who purchase it (as well as the politicos they kick back some of the profits too), and will further impoverish the citizens of this country in future years.</p>

<p>Senator <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/government/article/0,2777,DRMN_23906_4457671,00.html">Bingaman</a> had other wise words, though:  "Our public lands are a legacy for future generations. We shouldn't liquidate that legacy."</p>

<p>GOP Senator Larry Craig of Idaho joined in, saying "Public lands are an asset that need to be managed and conserved," while Democratic Rep. Mark Udall of Colorado came up with an apt <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_3485264">analogy</a>, "It's like selling your homestead to pay your credit cards."</p>

<p>Senator <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/breaking_news/13844072.htm">Dianne Feinstein</a> is also on the right track, saying "California's remaining wildlands are diminishing at a rapid rate, and we need, at the very least, to keep what we have, not to sell them off to the highest bidder," and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-bush-land-sale,1,1070898.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines">adding</a> "I will do everything I can to defeat this effort."</p>

<p>Let's make sure she has some help.</p>

				<p>I've only had a chance to briefly peruse the NASA budget <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/142458main_FY07_budget_full.pdf">proposal</a>, but it didn't take long to discover at least one major negative impact on important Earth science.  The launch of the Global Precipitation Measurement mission, whose data will be so important for improved understanding of hurricanes, amongst other things, has been put off a further two-and-a-half years to late 2012.</p>

<p>Last spring, I summarized the GPM mission in a <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">post</a> here.  Its goals:<blockquote><em>GPM aims to provide "near-global measurement of precipitation, its distribution, and physical processes," in order to help scientists more fully understand the details of Earth's water cycle.  The total cost is approximately one billion dollars, so it is a major project.  Fittingly, the data it gathers will be extremely useful in many areas of direct benefit to society.   Climate scientists will be able to improve their climate models and thus improve climate prediction, which will be crucial to planning for and trying to reduce the effects of global warming in coming years.  Meteorologists will be able to use this data to improve their weather models and thus improve weather forecasts.  And hydrologists will be able to use data about rainfall in large drainage basins to better understand flood hazards and to enable more precise planning of activities dependent upon fresh water, which is an awful lot of activities</em></blockquote></p>

<p>As I wrote in that same post, the schedule of GPM was one of the top concerns of the National Academy of Sciences panel that last year warned Congress that NASA's fleet of Earth-observing missions was at risk of collapse.</p>

<p>Those concerns are not likely to be allayed by news like this.</p>
