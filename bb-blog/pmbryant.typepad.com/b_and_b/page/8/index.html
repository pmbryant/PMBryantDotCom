		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>As the hours tick down on this biennial session of the Texas legislature, the state house has devolved into chaos due to a renewed, so far unsuccessful, attempt to oust the current dictatorial GOP House Speaker, Tom Craddick.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/052607dntexspeaker.3013918.html">Dallas Morning-News</a> has more on last night's quite unusual events.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though, the status of the bill to lift the cap on funding of state parks via the sales tax on sporting goods and the final total that our long neglected parks will receive over the next two years are both still up in the air.</p>

<p>State Rep. Harvey Hilderbran of Kerrville is lamenting that no one in the state Senate is championing parks, leaving that job up to him.&nbsp; (Jeff Wentworth, GOP senator from San Antonio and the hill country and presumed parks advocate, where are you?)&nbsp; From the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA052607.10A.parks_funding.3591182.html">San Antonio Express-News</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I'm championing it here, and I champion it in the Senate, too,&quot; Hilderbran said about his efforts to lift the sporting goods tax cap on revenue that flows to state parks. &quot;I'm going over there, bursting into meetings with the lieutenant governor and other people on other bills, saying, 'What in the hell's going on? You promised this.'&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">More than 20 of the state's 31 senators originally signed on to legislation to remove the cap, but questions about the funding and a study of the revenue are dividing lawmakers. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I'm confident that we are going to have an agreement that's going to be good for our park system,&quot; said Sen. Craig Estes, R-Wichita Falls, who is the Senate's chief negotiator for House Bill 12.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Lawmakers are proposing to increase the operating budget for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department from about $50 million to $157 million for the two-year budget cycle. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">But $16 million of the increase is a &quot;phantom,&quot; Hilderbran said, because it relies on such changes as charging scouting groups and church organizations admission into state parks. And an additional $74 million of the increase hinges on HB 12 passing, he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;So it's not quite as good as it sounds,&quot; Hilderbran said.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>HB12 is the bill to lift the cap on funding via the sporting goods sales tax -- a variant of the original one co-sponsored by a huge majority in both the Senate and House.&nbsp; It passed the House virtually unanimously.&nbsp; It passed the Senate, but in an altered form that Hilderbran called &quot;<a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/blog/?p=411">crummy</a>&quot; according to a report from the Texas Observer earlier this week.&nbsp; Now the differences need to be worked out in a conference committee, and there's only a couple days left to do so.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And with the House in chaos due to this last minute battle over the speakership, our parks may be left by the wayside yet again.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/05/iraq_war_fundin.html">Funding the Iraq War</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I have plenty of my own opinions on the current situation in Congress regarding funding Bush's Iraq War, but while I try to gather time to express them, at least two others have expressed viewpoints with which I can get behind.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://stxc.blogspot.com/2007/05/give-congressional-democrats-break.html">South Texas Chisme</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Congressional Democrats who voted for the latest war funding bill have been taking quite a beating from anti-war Democrats. I opposed the clusterf**k in Iraq before we invaded and continue to oppose it. However, I'm inclined to give the Congressional Democrats who voted for the war funding bill a break. Even with the support of every Democrat (and a few Republicans), they did not have the votes to overcome a Presidential veto. The stubborn jerk the American people put in the Whitehouse (twice!), the guy who constantly uses the troops for photo ops while opposing active-duty pay raises and veterans benefits, would not hesitate to increase the troops suffering for political gain. Bush has stated that ending the Iraq war would be the next President's job. Bush has never cleaned up one of his own failures. How could anybody assume he'd do anything different now?</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>And, from <a href="http://www.mcblogger.com/archives/2007/05/congressional_d_1.html">McBlogger</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">You know, there is something to be said for being as obstinate as Bush and cutting off all funding from the DoD. It's brinksmanship and it's a game the Democrats will likely lose. I like Olbermann's commentary because it fully encapsulates all the anger and frustration I and many others feel. I don't like it because it misplaces that anger and frustration which should rightfully be directed at two places... Connecticut native George Bush who vetoed the bill that placed a deadline on our involvement in Iraq and the Congressional Republicans who let that veto stand. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">It is to them that I say 'We're done'. The American people see past your pathetic and cynical attempt to hold the men and women of the US Armed Services hostage to your failed policies and misguided attempts to remake the world. While we would LOVE nothing more than for Congressional Democrats to throw a giant wrench in everything, we know that isn't possible as long as Congressional Republicans feel free to continue enabling the disastrous President Bush.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Al Gore's last project was to help bring the urgency of the climate crisis to the attention of the American people.&nbsp; That, as we all know, has been a tremendous success over the last year.&nbsp; Now, he is moving on to the next phase, as New York Times Magazine's James Traub <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/20/magazine/20wwln-gore-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1">describes</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Over the last three decades, he has been trying to explain a complicated and unattractive idea that scarcely anyone wanted to hear — that mankind has threatened its future on the planet by massively increasing the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Now, thanks in part to Gore himself, fewer and fewer people dispute this premise. But winning the argument — the smoking-causes-cancer part — is only the beginning. Gore and the country’s major environmental groups have now embarked on a three-year effort, for which Gore hopes to raise hundreds of millions of dollars, to persuade the American people, and the political parties, to take drastic action to curb greenhouse gases. It is a campaign of such vast ambition that you could almost imagine passing up a run at the presidency in order to pursue it. “The central challenge,” he said to me later that evening, as he was waiting to go onstage at the </span><a title="More articles about University of Miami" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_miami/index.html?inline=nyt-org"><span style="color: #003300;">University of Miami</span></a><span style="color: #003300;">, “is to expand the limits of what’s now considered politically possible. The outer boundary of what’s considered plausible today still falls far short of the near boundary of what would actually solve the crisis.”</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">“An Inconvenient Truth” erased the taint of partisanship from the Gore persona. By last fall, he had become the chairman and prime mover of the Alliance for Climate Protection. He hired a C.E.O. and began thinking about strategy. Meanwhile, “An Inconvenient Truth” had been winning new converts, as the slide show had before. Kevin Wall, a celebrated rock promoter who designed the “media architecture” of the Live 8 global concerts in 2005, attended the premiere and found himself thinking, as Bender had the year before, “How do we take what Al has done with this movie to the next step, and reach billions of people and really move the needle?” That next step was the global concert. Wall signed up the BBC and NBC to broadcast the events, and MSN to provide broadband coverage. Wall wasn’t thinking about Gore, but when the two met, Gore suggested that the concerts, to be held this summer on July 7, serve as the alliance’s launching pad.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Live Earth, as the event has been christened, will be just about the biggest thing in planetary history, and all the profits will go to the alliance. Concerts will be held on “all seven continents,” including Antarctica. For the American concert, to be held at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Wall has commitments from the Police, Smashing Pumpkins, the Dave Matthews Band, Ludacris, Alicia Keys and others; the European concert, at Wembley Stadium in London, will include </span><a title="More articles about Madonna." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/_madonna/index.html?inline=nyt-per"><span style="color: #003300;">Madonna</span></a><span style="color: #003300;">, the Black Eyed Peas, the Beastie Boys, Duran Duran and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The host sites will have wall-to-wall radio, broadcast, cable and online coverage; another 30 to 40 countries will be “very big,” Wall says, while satellite television and radio broadcast will be available in 100 to 120 other nations.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Live Earth is only the beginning. On his laptop, Gore showed me a diagram with a fleur-de-lis at the center and lines radiating out to indicate every facet of the vast campaign. ...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">But the core of everything is the three-year program of mass persuasion to be conducted under the aegis of the Alliance for Climate Protection. The alliance will not lobby or even propose specific solutions to global warming; rather, it will seek to break the climate crisis out of the crunchy confines of environmentalism. Global warming is going to have a giant product rollout. Gore talks constantly about the need to move public opinion; he is convinced that what now seem like forbidding political and technical obstacles to drastically reducing carbon emissions will give way once we marshal the will to act. And Gore says he believes that once people understand the science, they’ll share his sense of urgency. Thanks to Hurricane Katrina, and balmy winters, and animals evacuating their habitats, and all those terrifying pictures of melting glaciers, that sense may already be taking hold. According to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, 78 percent of Americans believe that global warming requires action “right away.”</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Could it be the Gore is having a bigger impact on the public opinion surrounding this particular issue than if he were actually President of the United States?</span> </p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/05/headlines_earli.html">Bush passing the buck on action against global warming</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Headlines earlier this week suggested that President Bush might finally be acting against global warming.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/nation/05/15/15bushenergy.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> had a typical example, with the headline&nbsp; &quot;Bush orders EPA to craft plan for regulating auto emissions,&quot; and the subhead &quot;President sets 2008 deadline for proposals.&quot;</p>

<p>But in reality, he is boxed into a corner by public opinion and Supreme Court decisions, and now is trying to run out the clock on his watch, as Frank O'Donnell of Clean Air Watch points out on <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2007/05/17/playing_stall_ball_on_clean_air.php">TomPaine.com</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Several decades ago, a popular strategy emerged in college basketball known as the “four corners” offense.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">It was a stall tactic—made famous by the University of North Carolina—used to retain a lead by holding onto the ball until the clock ran out.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">President Bush has borrowed this stall-ball strategy as a way to delay efforts by California and other states to reduce global warming pollution from motor vehicles.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The Double-Dribbler-in-Chief rolled out </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070514-4.html" target="_blank" lid="the plan this week" el="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070514-4.html"><span style="color: #003300;">the plan this week</span></a><span style="color: #003300;">, ordering the EPA to pass the ball back and forth with three cabinet departments before settling on any plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070514-1.html" target="_blank" lid="executive order demanded" el="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/05/20070514-1.html"><span style="color: #003300;">executive order demanded</span></a><span style="color: #003300;"> that EPA seek “concurrence” from the other departments, with the White House Office of Management and Budget and the industry-friendly Council on Environmental Quality supervising the game.<br /><br />In other words, the White House wrapped the EPA in a straitjacket of bureaucratic process designed to prevent fast-break action.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">“This is a complicated legal and technical matter, and it's going to take time to fully resolve,” said the president, declaring he wanted some answers by the end of 2008—that is, a few weeks before he leaves office.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Even worse, while Bush is stalling, he is also trying to tie the hands of others who are trying to act, such as the state of California.&nbsp; Frank O'Donnell continues:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">California applied for permission to enforce the standards [to cut greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles] way back in 2005, but the Bush administration refused to take the request out of the inbox, despite a full-court press by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. An EPA insider confided to me that the administration was hoping the Supreme Court would back the Bush do-nothing stance on global warming, thus giving them an excuse to dismiss the California request.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Having lost at the Supreme Court, Team Bush rebounded with another game plan to run out the clock. It looks pretty predictable: stall for as long as possible, then (after California presses the issue in court) perhaps reject the California plan in favor of a much weaker national approach.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Why doesn't Bush just resign now and save himself the trouble of trying to pass the buck to the next President?</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20070510/oxycontin-plea.htm">crime</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;With its OxyContin, Purdue unleashed a highly abusable, addictive, and potentially dangerous drug on an unsuspecting and unknowing public,&quot; [U.S. Attorney John] Brownlee said. &quot;For these misrepresentations and crimes, Purdue and its executives have been brought to justice.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The punishment:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;[C]ompany chief executive officer Michael Friedman, general counsel Howard Udell and former chief medical officer Paul Goldenheim each pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of misbranding the drug. Of the total fine [of $634.5 million], $34.5 million was levied on those three.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>To me, the punishment does not come close to fitting the crime. The fines are paltry compared to the amount of money that the company, and no doubt the executives, made by falsely promoting an addictive drug. No one is doing any jail time.</p>

<p>I saw U.S. Attorney Brownlee on the PBS Newshour Friday and he kept emphasizing how the company had been brought to justice and that executives had to walk into court and admit to being guilty. But a company does not act on its own--human beings do. And the three executives who walked into court to admit guilt then walked right back out and into their old jobs.</p>

<p>And it is not remotely plausible to me that these three were the only ones involved in this level of illegal activity.</p>

<p>This strikes me as a very incomplete form of justice.</p>

				<p>So much for my hope that <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA051307.27A.ELX_Helotes.3688fc0.html">Helotes</a> would turn back the forces of uncontrolled development -- the forces that were the primary contributor to the infamous mulch fire that caused so much distress to that small town so recently.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">A contentious, often bitter campaign came to an end Saturday night when all three incumbents up for election — the mayor and two council members — lost to their challengers. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The incumbents, who ran on a pro-preservation slate with the motto &quot;Take Back Helotes,&quot; will vacate their seats next week. The challengers, who ran as an unofficial slate that came to be known as the &quot;red party&quot; because of the color of their campaign signs, promised a plan for smart growth and development. They will take their seats after the votes are canvassed May 17.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Tom Schoolcraft beat Jon Allan for mayor, Jeff Ellis defeated Linda Boyer-Owens for City Council Place 3 and Rich Whitehead took the Place 5 council seat from Stuart Birnbaum. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Schoolcraft defeated Allan by 21 votes. Ellis won by 53, and Whitehead took his seat with a 76-vote margin. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Allan said he was surprised and disappointed and the results just &quot;blew him away.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;What do you say? For me, it is really difficult because I worked so hard for this city, and I don't think anybody could have worked so hard and done so much for the city as Linda, Stuart and I did,&quot; he said. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;We are pleased with the results, and that's about it,&quot; Schoolcraft said Saturday night. &quot;We have a lot of happy constituents out here, and we are having fun celebrating. We are going to get to work as soon as we are given the oath.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote>

				<p>The <a href="http://web.dailytimes.com/story.lasso?ewcd=0678a9e168b8bc0d">Kerrville Daily Times</a> reports that the leading parks advocate in the state legislature, Rep. Harvey Hilderbran, is speaking out about the state Senate's lack of action on the bill to fully fund our state parks system.&nbsp; The bill passed the state House recently with an overwhelming margin.&nbsp; Now it needs action in the senate, and it isn't getting any from Lt.

Despite that overwhelming majority, the measure has seen no movement in the Senate.<br /><br />Hilderbran said Senate members are touting their own plan, which would appropriate a one-time $140 million allocation for parks. That’s more than the $105 million allocations allowed in Hilderbran’s funding plan with the cap lifted.<br /><br />“But, what that takes is for you to have confidence that the Legislature is going to appropriate that level of funding every year, and that isn’t going to happen,” Hilderbran said.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>This has been one of my primary concerns all along -- that, despite the sudden and apparent overwhelming support for funding our parks, state GOP leaders would quash the bill in the state Senate.&nbsp; Will they come through on their promises to lift the funding cap?</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">“I’m going to stick to this,” Hilderbran said. “We’ve got to get the lieutenant governor and the Senate leadership to do what the people have asked and pass this.”</span></p></blockquote></blockquote>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2007/05/helotes_electio.html">Sparks flying in Helotes in advance of council elections</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Emotions appear to be running high in the final days of the Helotes city council campaign.&nbsp; As I wrote about a few days ago, these <a href="../../2007/05/forces_promotin.html">elections</a> pit three one-term, sensible-growth, incumbents, against developer-funded opponents, who appear to be aiming to take back the small town in the name of sprawl -- sprawl that is engulfing much of the Hill Country on the outskirts of San Antonio.</p>

<p>Another sign dispute has erupted, as reported by the Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/neighbors/northwest/stories/MYSA050907.1H.NW.signs.20bc984.html">yesterday</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Two informational neighborhood signs at the Cedar Springs subdivision have been at the center of several past disputes and recently sparked another controversy. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Around April 27, the signs just inside the subdivision's entrance and exit gates displayed messages that city officials said are in violation of a city ordinance and also could jeopardize the nonprofit status of the Cedar Springs Homeowners Association. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">One read: &quot;Green party respect CS private property ask B4 placing your election signs.&quot; The other said: &quot;Helotes taxes going up 24 percent do U care.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The term &quot;green party&quot; refers to the color of the signs for City Council incumbents — Mayor Jon Allan, Place 3 Councilwoman Linda Boyer-Owens and Place 5 Councilman Stuart Birnbaum, who are seeking re-election May 12. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Allan said the statement about the tax increase is inaccurate and appears to be in reference to information from campaign literature of the challengers: Tom Schoolcraft is running for mayor; Jeff Ellis for Place 3; and Rich Whitehead for Place 5. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">A city ordinance that governs signs like those in the 501-home Cedar Springs subdivision says the purpose of &quot;residential subdivision changeable copy signs for gated communities&quot; is to &quot;provide non-commercial and non-political information related to the residential subdivision.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;Regardless of the specifics of what the signs say, they can't have any political information of any kind on them,&quot; Allan said. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">But the HOA board members, who said they were responsible for posting the copy, disagree. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;We do not see the information as political, but rather as fact and for the information of the community,&quot; said Mike Taylor, board treasurer. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Board president Lorraine Shattuck agreed but would not comment further. Allan said he called Shattuck twice and left messages to try to resolve the issue, but his calls were not returned.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The evidence for the heated emotions comes in an anecdote related later in this article:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">A Helotes Police Department report about the April 28 event at the corner of Cedar Point and Hausman Road indicates that Helotes residents John Eakin and Linda Montemayor were involved. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">According to the report, Eakin was campaigning for the incumbents when Montemayor was driving into the neighborhood and an exchange occurred. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I was trying to go into the neighborhood and John was walking toward me with fliers. ... I shook my head and he kept coming and I told him that 'I would not vote for y'all if my life depended on it,'&quot; Montemayor said. &quot;He then told me 'We don't want your white trash votes anyway,' and I called the police.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Eakin admits that he was there and was asked to leave by Apodaca [vice president of the homeowners association], but he denies making the comment to Montemayor. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;The police did come and make me sign a document about trespassing, and I did speak with Linda, but I did not saying anything like that to her. She was screaming obscenities,&quot; he said.</span> </p></blockquote></blockquote><p>This particular homeowners association may be advertising political slogans attacking the sensible-growth incumbent councilmembers, but the homeowners who live there are far from unanimous in this feeling.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The article quotes resident Bill Hollis, &quot;There is no other way to label these people [the homeowners' association board] except as a rogue board, and with them, anything goes. ...&nbsp; When you file as a nonprofit organization with the state and become tax-exempt, you can't be political in any way. Those signs are clearly political and we could lose our nonprofit status, but it is not the first time they have violated nonpolitical rules.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Resident Edie Lopez is quoted also, saying, &quot;Anyone who has knowledge of organizations like this that are nonprofit knows that you don't do certain things, especially political things, and this is not something the entire neighborhood agrees with.&quot;</p>

<p>Living a few miles down the road in unincorporated Bexar County, just outside the San Antonio city limits, I have unfortunately no say in this election, or, for that matter, in any of the San Antonio city council elections next week.&nbsp; So I am envious of the residents of Helotes.&nbsp; They have an opportunity to stand up (once again) to the immense wealth of the real estate developers pushing for unrestrained development of the land and neighborhoods we love.&nbsp; My only voice is in the state legislature, which is tightly controlled by these forces, with any glimmer of wresting that control away far off.</p>

<p>I hope that the residents of Helotes make the same decision that they made two years ago, when they voted in Mayor Jon Allan and councilmembers Linda Boyer-Owens and Stuart Hirshbaum, and voted out uncontrolled sprawl.</p>

<p>Here are some words from Allan, Boyer-Owens, and Hirshbaum on their platform, as quoted in the <a href="http://blogs.mysanantonio.com/weblogs/nbrnw/2007/04/amanda_reimherr_more_comments.html">Express-News</a> on April 25:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Allan:&nbsp; <span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I see the big issue is how do we deal with development. We have now required developers to build sidewalks and boosted the tree ordinance. It makes sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;What I tried to do the last couple of years is protect the open spaces and realistically come up with a plan so that as development comes in, we are setting aside parks and open space, and saving more trees. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;We have implemented a dark sky ordinance to preserve it from light pollution and we are undergoing a big planning process to deal with how we will sustain development.&quot;</span></p>

<p>Boyer-Owens:&nbsp; <span style="color: #003300;">&quot;The issues are still much like they were when I ran two years ago. The press of urban sprawl and trying to maintain the Helotes the town we love to live in. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;If reelected, we really want to finish the job we started. We had a lot to clean up in our first two years, and now we need to move forward. We have the new master plan/comprehensive planning process started, and I think it will lay down the consensus of the community about what Helotes wants for the future. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;We want to pursue becoming home rule, that takes a lot of work and lots of citizen input and I want to see an effort to cultivate and recruit the type of businesses and services that Helotians want. The claims of depleting the reserve fund aren´t true.&quot;</span></p>

<p>Hirshbaum:&nbsp; <span style="color: #003300;">&quot;Parks and open space is important issue, we can either have rampant development and clear cutting or we can try to protect some portion of this as green space for citizens to use. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;I think we can do this without using tax money and without undue financial burden on the citizens. I don't think the city can really consider itself a proper community without having some park space for its citizens to use. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;Quality of life issues are important, and parks and playgrounds for children are the major concerns that I have and reasons I have decided to run again. I think that the current mayor and council are making great strides in that direction and another two years would help move us along.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Final voting is Saturday, May 12.&nbsp; Last time, Allan and his two allies won by a literal handful of votes.&nbsp; The cliche is accurate in this case:&nbsp; every vote counts.&nbsp; </span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The blog of the Texas Observer magazine has an informative <a href="http://www.texasobserver.org/blog/?p=332">rundown</a> of the good and the bad in the state parks funding bill passed out of the Texas House by a 141 to nothing vote yesterday.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Parks advocates are now closer to achieving one of their main goals of the session: busting the cap on the sporting goods tax, which could potentially free up an extra $80 million a year for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">However, some troubling provisions remain in in the bill. For starters, HB 12 </span><a title="Inmates and Texas parks" href="http://www.texasobserver.org/blog/?p=306"><span style="color: #003300;">taps</span></a><span style="color: #003300;"> more inmates to do the grunt work on Texas state natural areas, picking up trash or digging foundations for new buildings, as Hilderbran explained today.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span class="sg"><span style="color: #003300;">Also left in the bill is the controversial transfer of historic sites from TPWD to the Texas Historical Commission, an agency headed by Craddick crony John Nau III. A wholesale transfer of historic sites, such as </span><a title="Sebastopol House and Historical Commission" href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/sebastopol/"><span style="color: #003300;">Sebastopol House</span></a><span style="color: #003300;"> in Seguin and rock climbing mecca </span><a title="Hueco Tanks" href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/hueco_tanks/"><span style="color: #003300;">Hueco Tanks</span></a><span style="color: #003300;"> near El Paso, is opposed by parks advocates, visitors, and many of the local communities. </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">“It’s unfortunate that there are some sites that do not want to go to the historical commission that will be going,” said Beth McDonald, president of </span><a title="Texans for State Parks" href="http://www.texansforstateparks.org/default.html"><span style="color: #003300;">Texans for State Parks</span></a><span style="color: #003300;">. McDonald fears that the Historical Commission will not have sufficient state money to maintain the sites - some of which receive few visitors - and will turn to outsourcing, increased entrance fees, and privatization schemes to generate revenue. Of course that may be the whole point of Nau’s - and Craddick’s - gambit: starve the sites of funding and then turn them over to private sector control.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Even with these concerns, 141 to nothing is a pretty impressive margin.&nbsp; But exactly how much cash our legislators will provide in the end remains to be seen.</span></p>
