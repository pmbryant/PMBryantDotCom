					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2005/05/san_antonio_pro.html">San Antonio Proposition 1: Buying land to protect the Edwards aquifer</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Matt at <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/05/reasons-to-vote-prop-1_03.html">Just Another Blog</a> has a post up on the top ten reasons to vote for San Antonio's Proposition 1 in the imminent municipal elections.  Prop 1 is the initiative to implement (continue, really) a 1/8-cent sales tax and to devote the money to purchase land for protection of the <a href="../../2005/04/edwards_aquifer.html">Edwards aquifer</a>.  A similar program was passed by San Antonio voters in 2000 and expires this year.</p>

<p>His first two reasons get right to the heart of the matter:<br />
<blockquote><em>1. The Edwards Aquifer is the primary source of drinking water for 1.7 million South-central Texans today, and will be for a million more citizens within 25 years.</p>

<p>2. If we fail to protect the aquifer and pollute our drinking water, we’ll have to build water-treatment plants that will cost billions of dollars. Talk about squandermania!</em></blockquote></p>

<p>A couple later reasons explain the rationale:<br />
<blockquote><em>7. New state law allows the city to acquire land both inside and outside of Bexar County, so we can now protect land to the west of the city, where 70 percent of the aquifer’s recharge takes place and where land is far more affordable. </p>

<p>8. Edwards Aquifer Authority studies show that when impervious cover exceeds 15 percent, water-quality problems emerge. Attaining that goal is more likely in rural lands to the west, where most of our water comes from.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>And land out west is cheaper, allowing us to spend the money more efficiently.  The 2000 initiative was initially supposed to acquire 10,000 acres, but only was able to acquire 6,500 due to dramatically rising land prices in Bexar County over the last few years.</p>

<p>San Antonio Express-News columnist Roddy Stinson has a similar <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/rstinson/stories/MYSA050105.3A.Stinson.22c4e44f7.html">list</a>, but from the opposite point of view:  "Top 10 reasons for opposing sales tax Propositions 1 and 2."  (Proposition 2 is another worthwhile initiative to increase the sales tax by 1/8-cent in order to acquire further  land for linear parks in the city.)  Stinson's list consists primarily of anti-local government rants and guilt-by-association-with-the-not-guilty.  </p>

<p>In particular:<blockquote><em>2. Taxpayers have not been told (a) what land, (b) whose properties or (c) how many acres will be bought with the $90 million authorized for collection by Proposition 1.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>So he claims it is a major problem that the San Antonio government hasn't already mapped out exactly which land they will purchase.  That sounds like a brilliant negotiating tactic, doesn't it?  And no doubt if they had, Stinson would be railing against government waste&#151planning to spend money they may never have.<br />
<blockquote><em>6. At some point, taxpayers have to say, "Enough." </p>

<p>If the state Legislature raises the sales tax from 6.25 percent to 7.25 percent and city voters approve Propositions 1 and 2, raising the local sales tax to 17/8 percent, San Antonians will be perpetually burdened by a sales tax of 91/8 percent!<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Note that first "if."  The state House, run by the GOP, is proposing to raise sales taxes by a full cent.  That is far larger than the increase for both Propositions 1 and 2 combined.  Where are Stinson's rants against the state legislature?  Also note the gratuitous, false, insertion of the word "perpetually."</p>

<p>As if that is not bad enough, he concludes with this:<br />
<blockquote><em>7. According to information on the Web site of the Aquifer Protection Initiative, Proposition 1's backers include the Alamo Chapter of the Sierra Club ... </p>

<p>8. Texas Environmental Democrats ... </p>

<p>9. Esperanza Peace and Justice Center ... </p>

<p>10. La Tuna Icehouse. </p>

<p>I rest my case.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Perhaps we can take advantage of Stinson's knee-jerk reactions whenever the Sierra Club is mentioned (I've noticed the phrase "Sierra Club wackos" commonly shows up in his writings.  It's kind of cute, in a weird way, given how marginal the Sierra Club is here in Texas.)  Next time, perhaps the Club should issue a press release directly to Stinson claiming to be on the opposite side of an issue than they really are.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to Matt for coming up with an excellent response to Stinson.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>At least one elected official in the state capitol is looking out for the public interest.&nbsp; Three cheers for state Rep. <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared/tx/legislature/stories/05/3TAKINGS.html">Eddie Rodriguez</a> of Austin:</p><blockquote><p><em><span class="cxnshared">House Bill 2833 puts property rights ahead of
local environmental rules, just as the House tends to do. It
specifically targets Austin's ordinances, an old bone that lawmakers
have shown no reluctance to pick. And it now carries an amendment that
exempts San Antonio, the only big city outside Austin that is likely to
care about it.</span><br /><span class="cxnshared"><p>Yet two parliamentary moves in the past two
weeks, both by an Austin state representative, have left the bill in a
race against the clock.</p>
<p>On Monday, Democratic Rep. Eddie Rodriguez once again pulled the rug
out from under HB 2833, noting a technical error in the way an analysis
described the bill, which would force Austin and other cities to
compensate property owners for environmental regulations that devalue
their land beyond a certain point.</p>
<p>The so-called point of order would not have affected the bill had no
one raised it. But because Rodriguez did, the bill now must be approved
by the House Land and Resource Management Committee for the third time
and be set on another House calendar.</p>
<p>Last month, Rodriguez also had the bill sent back to committee — and delayed a vote — by pointing out a technical error.</p>
<p>The bill could be back on the House floor as early as this week, according to its author, Rep. Robby Cook, D-Eagle Lake.</p>
<p>The problem is that next week, a series of legislative deadlines
will start to kick in, and bills that have not been approved will start
to die on the vine. That shrinking window now represents the best
chance to kill the bill, at least in the House.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this bill is really bad for Austin,&quot; Rodriguez said. &quot;I have to use every weapon in my arsenal.&quot;</p></span></em></p></blockquote><p>Alas, this '<a href="../../2005/04/texas_legislatu.html">Taxpayer Extortion Act</a>' being pushed by, among others, GOP Agricultural Commissioner <a href="../../2005/04/extortion.html">Susan Combs</a> and the <a href="../../2005/04/what_is_the_tex.html">Texas Landowners Conservancy</a>, is not dead yet.&nbsp; Yet perhaps there is hope.</p>

<p>For more on this bill, see my numerous earlier posts, starting <a href="../../2005/04/texas_legislatu.html">here</a>.&nbsp; Also see the Texas Municipal League's <a href="http://www.tml.org/leg_updates/legis_update041505c_land2833.htm">two</a> <a href="http://www.tml.org/leg_updates/legis_update042205a_landuse.htm">articles</a> on HB 2833.&nbsp; And, finally, see this other San Antonio blog, <a href="http://bakirita.blogs.com/my_weblog/2005/04/aquifer_action_.html">buddenblog</a>, which I was fortunate enough to recently discover while searching for more news about this bill.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Yet another (new for me) San Antonio blog has commented on this atrocious piece of legislation:&nbsp; <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/04/bad-economics-bad-legislation.html">Just Another Blog</a>, by a self-professed &quot;political operative&quot; named Matt.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>To great fanfare early last year, President Bush announced that he wanted NASA to focus on returning humans to the Moon and on putting humans on Mars.&nbsp; Of course, Bush never followed up those words with the money it would take to implement them.&nbsp; Now, NASA is predictably <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/nation/3157708">cannibalizing</a> its science programs as it tries the impossible task of fulfilling the Moon-Mars objectives within its pre-existing budget.</p>
<p>According to a National Research Council (NRC) report released last week, among the possible victims is NASA's system of Earth-observing satellites.&nbsp; Since natural disasters and impending global climate change threaten the future livelihood of a large fraction of the world's population, this appears to be a very foolhardy decision.</p>

<p>The scientists on the NRC panel, an arm of the National Academies of Science, say in their <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309096723/html">report</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The current U.S. civilian Earth observing system centers on the environmental satellites operated by NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]; the atmosphere-, biospheres-, ocean-, ice-, and land-observation satellites of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS); and the Landsat satellites, which are operated by a cooperative arrangement involving NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).&nbsp; Today, this system of environmental satellites is at risk of collapse.&nbsp; Although NOAA has plans to modernize and refresh its weather satellites, NASA has no plan to replace its EOS platforms after their nominal 6-year lifetimes end (beginning with the Terra satellite in 2005), and it has canceled, descoped, or delayed at least six planned missions, including the Landsat Data Continuity mission.</em></p>

<p><em>These decisions appear to be driven by a major shift in priorities at a time when NASA is moving to implement a new vision for space exploration.&nbsp; This change in priorities jeopardizes NASA's ability to fulfill its obligations in other important presidential initiatives, such as the Climate Change Research Initiative and the subsequent Climate Change Science Program.&nbsp; It also calls into question future U.S. leadership in the Global Earth Observing System of Systems, an international effort initiated by the current Administration.&nbsp; The nation's ability to pursue a visionary space exploration agenda depends critically on its success in applying knowledge of Earth to maintain economic growth and security at home.</em></p></blockquote><p>The panel lists six important missions that have been adversely affected by NASA's budgetary decisions.&nbsp; Despite my strong interest in both science and environmental issues, I was not familiar with a single one of these missions.&nbsp; I suspect I am not alone.&nbsp; So I decided to look into more detail about what we may be missing out on unless NASA leaders get their act together.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://gpm.gsfc.nasa.gov/"><img width="80" height="66" border="0" src="../../images/gpm.jpg" title="Gpm" alt="Gpm" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>One of the missions mentioned is called <a href="http://gpm.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.html">Global Precipitation Measurement</a> (GPM).&nbsp; This is the only one of the six that has been merely delayed—having its launch date postponed until at least 2010, three years later than originally planned.&nbsp; In fact, last year, NASA listed <a href="http://www.house.gov/science/hearings/full05/apr28/Charter.pdf">2012</a> for the planned launch date, so perhaps even the 2010 date may not be met.&nbsp; </p>

<p>GPM aims to provide &quot;near-global measurement of precipitation, its distribution, and physical processes,&quot; in order to help scientists more fully understand the details of Earth's water cycle.&nbsp; The total cost is approximately one billion dollars, so it is a major project.&nbsp; Fittingly, the data it gathers will be extremely useful in many areas of direct benefit to society.&nbsp; &nbsp;Climate scientists will be able to improve their climate models and thus improve climate prediction, which will be crucial to planning for and trying to reduce the effects of global warming in coming years.&nbsp; Meteorologists will be able to use this data to improve their weather models and thus improve weather forecasts.&nbsp; And hydrologists will be able to use data about rainfall in large drainage basins to better understand flood hazards and to enable more precise planning of activities dependent upon fresh water, which is an awful lot of activities.</p>

<p>GPM is a follow-up mission to the <a href="http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission</a> (TRMM), both of which are joint projects of NASA and the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency.&nbsp; TRMM was launched in 1997 on a Japanese rocket, is several years past its designed lifespan, and is schedule to end operations later this year in order to use its remaining fuel to perform a controlled atmospheric re-entry.&nbsp; </p>



<p><a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/trmmbonnie.gif"><img width="200" height="188" border="0" alt="Trmmbonnie" title="Trmmbonnie" src="../../images/trmmbonnie.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>TRMM, despite capabilities much lower than envisioned for GPM, has been
a dramatic success.&nbsp; According to the NRC panel, among other things, TRMM's measurements
have &quot;led to improved operational forecasts of precipitation and
estimates of hurricane storm tracks, which in turn have almost
certainly reduced economic losses and saved lives.&quot;&nbsp; At right is a <a href="http://gpm.gsfc.nasa.gov/Newsletter/december04/article3.htm">dramatic simulation</a>, using Hurricane Bonnie in 1998, of how inclusion of TRMM data on rainfall improves hurricane forecasting.</p>

<p>As a GPM scientist states in the December 2004 GPM <a href="http://gpm.gsfc.nasa.gov/Newsletter/december04/article3.htm">newsletter</a>, &quot;The usefulness of the TRMM mission in the realm of hurricane
research bodes well for the success of GPM. With enhanced measurement
capabilities, expanded data coverage, and improved data resolution,
GPM should greatly facilitate hurricane researchers in their
quest to understand this important phenomenon.&quot;&nbsp; And that is just one area of climate and weather research where GPM data is likely to prove highly beneficial to the public.</p>

<p>TRMM is a single satellite that, due to its orbit, only covers relatively low-latitude locations—between 35 degrees north and 35 degrees south—and even those only sporadically.&nbsp; GPM, on the other hand, is planned to
consist of a core spacecraft and eight &quot;constellation&quot; satellites in higher inclination orbits, so that a higher fraction of
the Earth's surface can be covered much more frequently—on average
every three hours.</p>

<p>The heart of the <a href="http://gpm.gsfc.nasa.gov/documents/PID39255.pdf">GPM mission</a> is its core spacecraft and the two instruments it will contain:&nbsp; a microwave imager and a precipitation radar.&nbsp; &nbsp;The microwave imager on the GPM core spacecraft is similar to the one flown on TMRR, but will have a main reflector double the size of TMRR's, thus halving the size of the area of the Earth's surface that it measures and so resulting in significantly higher accuracy.&nbsp; The precipitation radar is also enhanced from the one flown on TMRR, which was the first of its kind operated in space.&nbsp; The GPM radar will make measurements at two frequencies instead of one.&nbsp; The differential reflectivity between these radars will allow scientists to infer drop size distributions and rain-rates.&nbsp; The comprehensive data on cloud structure and rainfall rates gathered
by the two instruments on the core spacecraft will be used to calibrate data gathered by the
constellation spacecraft, which will include spacecraft designed for other purposes but that have some kind of capacity to measure rainfall (such as weather satellites).&nbsp; Furthermore, data from the individual instruments on each of the spacecraft can be compared against each other over time to allow scientists to further improve the accuracy of the measurements.</p>

<p>The remaining crucial components of the GPM mission are a ground validation system, where numerous ground stations will be used to validate and calibrate data gathered by the satellites—a classic reality check—and a dedicated data processing system.</p>



<p></p>

<p>Given the large scientific and societal benefits, including improved hurricane forecasting, improved climate models, and much more, replacement and enhancement of TRMM with GPM should be a high priority.&nbsp; The NRC panel obviously feels so, using their first recommendation to urge that &quot;the Global Precipitation Measurement mission be launched without further delays.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, NASA's leaders, due to Bush's unfunded Moon-Mars mandate, appear to have a different <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=16380">perspective</a> on the importance of Earth sciences:<br /> </p><blockquote><p><em>The
technological tools and scientific skills that NASA continues to
develop through studying Earth, which has the most complex ecosystem
with continuous interactions of biological, chemical and physical
processes at all time and space scales, are critical in the exploration
and search for life of other planets in our own solar system and beyond.</em></p></blockquote><p>Studying Earth is critical for the search for life on other planets?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It is critical for improving our lives here on Earth.&nbsp; As Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, Chairman of the House Science Committee put it <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=16379">last week</a>:
</p><blockquote><p><em>[NASA's] testimony describes Earth science research as being
significant to the extent that it informs our knowledge of, and our
capability to explore other planets. This is precisely backwards. The
planet that has to matter most to us is the one we live on. You'd think
that would go without saying. And we are woefully ignorant of the way
this planet works—of the functioning of the land, oceans and
atmosphere and how they interact.</em></p></blockquote><p>I plan to examine the other five Earth-observing missions cancelled or descoped by NASA in the coming days and weeks.</p>

<p>The small white bar at bottom left represents a scale of 2 km.&nbsp; The caption reads, in part:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>In this image from NASA’s Landsat 7 satellite, acquired on December 23, 2001, the dense vegetation of swampy bottomland forests, sloughs, oxbow river bends, and bayous in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge makes a dramatic contrast to the geometric checkerboard of farmlands. Ground that is bare or sparsely vegetated appears pinkish tan. The dense (but leafless in winter) vegetation of the refuge’s tupelo and cypress forests appears dark gray. When you look carefully (particularly in the high-resolution image), the forests are interwoven with swampy areas that appear lighter gray. A large swath of this gray swampy area runs through the narrow strip of the refuge that follows the Deview Bayou northeast of the large protected area near image center. Interstate 40 cuts diagonally across the southern part of this large tract of land.</em></p></blockquote><p>Images like this emphasize how amazing the re-discovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker is.&nbsp; Given the huge areas it needs to survive, how could it have possibly survived for over six decades in places like this?&nbsp; Hopefully we will learn answers to this and other questions in the coming years, and that the answers will help us to ensure that the ivory-bills, and other species, continue to survive.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The day after the amazing announcement that the <a href="../../2005/04/ivorybilled_woo.html">ivory-billed woodpecker</a> is not extinct after all, some skeptics have emerged. </p>

<p>Nick Matzke, at <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000986.html">The Panda's Thumb</a>, despite an admitted lack of expertise, worries that the bird seen may not actually be an ivory-bill.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><em>... I’ve got a bad feeling that hopes are going to be dashed again.&nbsp; What
they’ve put up in terms of data is scans of field notes and a detailed
analysis of one very short video that is being interpreted right at the
limits of its resolution.</em></p></blockquote> <p>As I mentioned yesterday, my initial reaction also was disbelief, but when I read how confident the experts are about this, how they spent over a year working on confirmation, I became convinced.&nbsp; Then I read the paper, watched the video, and remained convinced.&nbsp; Matzke's concern about the video is unfounded, in my opinion.&nbsp; Perhaps my confidence in the analysis of the video is a remnant of my background in astronomy.&nbsp; I am very used to the process of teasing significant amounts of information out of noisy, low-resolution data.&nbsp; By comparison with much of what astronomers frequently work with, the woodpecker video is extremely detailed.&nbsp; And, of course, the video is just the icing on the cake of the numerous sightings by expert ornithologists.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/04/28/reports_of_my_extinction_are_greatly_exaggerated.php">Carl Zimmer</a>, seconded by <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp?Id=1764">Chris Mooney</a>, cautions that just because some ivory-bills may still live, much ecological devastation has already occurred, both in the U.S. and around the world, and numerous other species may be doomed. Of course this isn't exactly news and so should do nothing to allay the joy that at least one species thought extinct may still have a chance at survival.&nbsp; If a few ivory-bills could survive on their own for decades with no special protections for its habitat, the species should have a decent chance for longer-term survival now that such special protections will be put in place.</p>

<p>Finally, PZ Myers at <a title="Pharyngula::Woodpecker woes" href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/woodpecker_woes/">Pharyngula</a> lets his cynical side
come to the forefront:</p><blockquote><p><em>Call me a cynic, but my first thought was that one bird does not a
species make, and that I don't find cause to celebrate in the fact that
we made it to the wreckage in time to catch the last gasps of a
magnificent animal. &quot;We killed them all…</em><em>but one!&quot; is not an inspiring rallying cry for environmentalists.</em></p></blockquote><p>Fortunately, Myers' imagined rallying cry is almost certainly not true.&nbsp; Hedwig at Living the Scientific Life <a href="https://girlscientist.blogspot.com/2005/04/another-email-from-search-participant.html">publishes</a> an email distributed by Scott Weidensaul, a nature writer who was a participant in the search party in Arkansas.&nbsp; He writes (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p><em>The sightings were all of a single bird, always a male (though there
was one undocumented sighting of a possible female). It appears the
search team was not operating near the bird's normal home range, since
the sightings averaged only about one per month; this is a huge area,
and there's lots of room for even a duck-sized woodpecker to disappear.
<strong>No one thinks it likely that this bird is the very last of its kind, so
it's likely there are more out there in the huge Big Woods region, or
in other bottomland forests along the Mississippi Delta</strong>.<br /><br />Interestingly,
in contrast to the noisy, fairly tame behavior Jim Tanner recorded for
the species in Louisiana in the 1930s, this bird has proven incredibly
shy and wary, always vanishing at the first hint of a human. Many
people -- and I include myself in this -- had long assumed that if
ivorybills survived in the U.S., someone would have found and
documented them decades ago. The fact that so many people, backed up
with technology like automated recording devices and cameras, had such
a hard time getting documentation in the Big Woods, suggests we've been
underestimating the difficulty of finding this species. The &quot;intensive&quot;
Pearl River search [in 2002], for example, involved six people for 30 days; most
times that a sighting has been followed up, it's been someone in a
canoe poking around for a day or two at most. <strong>One lesson from the Big
Woods is that we cannot easily dismiss any of the reports elsewhere in
the species' historic range, especially those in South Carolina and
Florida which have been persistent for many years. </strong>I know scientists
are following up on some of those reports even as the news is trumpeted
from Arkansas. Let's all keep our fingers crossed.<br /><br />This is one
of the most hopeful stories I've ever had the privilege to report on,
and it comes at a time when conservationists need some good news. It
shows how incredibly resilient nature can be if we give it a chance.</em></p></blockquote><p>Indeed, we need some good news, and this definitely counts.&nbsp; What happens next is up to all of us, but at least there is hope.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club, <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/carlpope/2005/04/nail-biting-on-arctic.asp">reports</a> on the status of the GOP legislative attempt to drill for oil in the <a href="../../2005/03/the_geography_o.html">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a>.&nbsp; Apparently there is at least some hope that the budget that contains this can be defeated in the House later today.&nbsp; Even if not, there is hope to defeat it later in the year.</p><blockquote><p><em>The House leadership is desperately scrambling to find enough votes to
pass a budget that would allow drilling the Arctic. Right now, they
don't have the votes -- they are meeting in Caucus and sharing the
proposal they have put together, so there are some details we still
await. ... Over on the Senate
side, swing Senators like Susan Collins are hoping that the final deal
will not include Arctic drilling, but I think they are likely to be
disappointed -- although if the House, which votes first, kills the
budget, as it looks at this moment like it might do tonight, the
Senators will be off the hook. Even if we lose today, the final and
decisive round will still come in September on Budget Reconciliation
but, if we win today, the Arctic is safe for another year, and probably
until the next elections.
</em></p></blockquote>

UPDATE:  Well, that hope was dashed.  The budget with drilling in it
passed by 3 votes according to Pope's update.

				<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4622633">Wow</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em><span class="program"><em><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3">Morning Edition</a>, </em></span><span class="date">April 28, 2005 · </span>
A group of wildlife scientists believe the ivory-billed woodpecker is
not extinct. They say they have made seven firm sightings of the bird
in central Arkansas. The landmark find caps a search that began more
than 60 years ago, after biologists said North America’s largest
woodpecker had become extinct in the United States. </em></p>

<p><em><a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/ivorybilledwoodpecker.jpg"><img width="150" height="168" border="0" src="../../images/ivorybilledwoodpecker.jpg" title="Ivorybilledwoodpecker" alt="Ivorybilledwoodpecker" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>The large, showy bird is an American legend -- it disappeared when
the big bottomland forests of North America were logged, and relentless
searches have produced only false alarms. Now, in an intensive
year-long search in the Cache River and White River national wildlife
refuges involving more than 50 experts and field biologists working
together as part of the Big Woods Partnership, an ivory-billed male has
been captured on video.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;We have solid evidence, there are solid
sightings, this bird is here,&quot; says Tim Barksdale, a wildlife
photographer and biologist.</em></p>

<p><em>For an NPR/National Geographic <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/re/">Radio Expeditions</a>
story, NPR science correspondent Christopher Joyce joined the search
last January along Arkansas’ White River, where a kayaker spotted what
he believed to be an ivory-billed woodpecker more than a year ago. Many
other similar sightings over the last 60 years have raised false hopes.
</em></p>

<p><em>But this time, Joyce reports that experts associated with the
Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology in New York and The Nature
Conservancy were able to confirm the sighting. They kept the find a
secret for more than a year, partly to give conservation groups and
government agencies time to protect the bird’s habitat.</em></p>

<p><em>The
Nature Conservancy has been buying and protecting land along the White
and Cache Rivers for years, along with the state and the federal Fish
and Wildlife Service. Since the discovery, they've bought more land to
protect the bird.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That's a pretty big secret to keep for a year, especially when reporters are in on it.&nbsp; Very impressive.</p>

<p>When I first was told that an ivory-billed woodpecker was found, I was skeptical.&nbsp; I've heard some of the false alarms over the years.&nbsp; But this time it's different.&nbsp; This time it's actually been seen multiple times by numerous experts, even captured on video.&nbsp; They sound <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/04/28/AR2005042800356.html">extremely confident</a>.&nbsp; So who am I to be skeptical?&nbsp; I'm sold.</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;The bird captured on video is clearly an ivory-billed woodpecker.
Amazingly, America may have another chance to protect the future of
this spectacular bird and the awesome forests in which it lives,&quot;
Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, said in
a statement.</em></p></blockquote><p>The most recent false alarm that I heard of was based on a plausible sighting in Louisiana in 1999.&nbsp; As a result of that, two methodical searches were performed in <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2002/march/">early 2002</a>.&nbsp; One by a &quot;dream team&quot; funded by Zeiss Sports Optics, and one from Cornell that set up state-of-the-art recording devices to listen for the bird's call.</p><blockquote><p><em>The Zeiss team failed to see a bird, but they found tantalizing
evidence: large nest cavities, tree bark possibly peeled by hungry
ivory-bills looking for beetle larvae -- and an unusual drumming sound.
The series of loud raps were unlike any other woodpecker the team had
ever heard.</em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the recording devices set up by Cornell <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/ivory/index.html">did not detect</a> any evidence of ivory-bills over the following months.&nbsp; So the 2002 effort, despite all the attention it received, ended in disappointment.</p>

<p>This year, the story is different.&nbsp; Amazingly so.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hedwig at <a href="https://girlscientist.blogspot.com/2005/04/holy-grailholy-bird.html">Living the Scientific Life</a> writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>I am joyful beyond words. The world is a better, richer, more magical
place. Knowing that this magnificent bird lives still, despite all the
terrible things that we have done to them, provides a glimmer of hope
that not all is lost.</em></p></blockquote><p>And Mike at <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/april2005.htm#4/28/05">10,000 Birds</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Details on this 
		momentous event are forthcoming and will be the subject of an 
		announcement by the journal <strong><a href="http://www.scienceonline.org/">
		Science</a></strong> later today. But for now, we can savor the satisfaction 
		of this joyous discovery, a validation of two undeniable truths. The 
		first, of course, is that where there is life, there's hope. The second, 
		no less profound, is that we have no earthly idea what goes on in the 
		backwoods of Arkansas!</em></p></blockquote><p>Reading the stories about the 2002 search again, I was struck by this <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2002/march/">quote</a> from the aforementioned John Fitzpatrick, director of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology:

</p><blockquote><p><em>


	&quot;It's so hard for me to talk about the idea of seeing an ivory-billed woodpecker without 
	actually getting a little choked up,&quot; he tells NPR correspondent Christopher Joyce. &quot;It would be so huge, 
	it's a bird that everybody who becomes a birdwatcher, who looked at the pictures in the 
	</em><em>Peterson Field Guide since they could read, and have dreamed about this spectacular 
	bird and all these beautiful forests it was in. The idea of actually laying eyes on one, I 
	would burst out into tears.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>I have not devoted my life to studying birds as Fitzpatrick has, but even the thought that they are still alive after 60 years and so much previously-futile searching makes me feel similarly.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; From the <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-04/potn-lte042705.php">press release</a> announcing this amazing news, it appears Fitzpatick, unsurprisingly, is not alone in his feelings:</p><blockquote><p><em>
While kayaking in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge on Feb. 11,
2004, Gene Sparling of Hot Springs, Ark., saw an unusually large,
red-crested woodpecker fly toward him and land on a nearby tree. He
noticed several field marks suggesting the bird was an ivory-billed
woodpecker. </em></p>

<p><em>
A week later, after learning of the sighting, Tim Gallagher, editor of
the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's Living Bird magazine, and Bobby
Harrison, associate professor at Oakwood College, Huntsville, Ala.,
interviewed Sparling. They were so convinced by his report that they
traveled to Arkansas and then with Sparling to the bayou where he had
seen the bird. </em></p>

<p><em>
On Feb. 27, as Sparling paddled ahead, a large black-and-white
woodpecker flew across the bayou less than 70 feet in front of
Gallagher and Harrison, who simultaneously cried out: &quot;Ivory-bill!&quot;
Minutes later, after the bird had disappeared into the forest,
Gallagher and Harrison sat down to sketch independently what each had
seen. Their field sketches, included in the </em><em>Science article, show the characteristic patterns of white and black on the wings of the woodpecker. 
</em></p>

<p><em>
&quot;When we finished our notes,&quot; Gallagher said, &quot;Bobby sat down on a log,
put his face in his hands and began to sob, saying, 'I saw an
ivory-bill. I saw an ivory-bill.'&quot; Gallagher said he was too choked
with emotion to speak. &quot;Just to think this bird made it into the 21st
century gives me chills. It's like a funeral shroud has been pulled
back, giving us a glimpse of a living bird, rising Lazarus-like from
the grave,&quot; he said.</em></p></blockquote><p>UPDATE 2:&nbsp; Via <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=show_topic&amp;forum=102&amp;topic_id=1429750">Democratic Underground</a>, here is an <a href="http://www.birdingamerica.com/ivorybilledwoodpecker.htm">eyewitness account</a> of an ivory-bill sighting in Arkansas in 2003 by amateur enthusiast Mary Scott, who runs a website entitled Birding America.&nbsp; She closes with this:</p><blockquote><p><em>The strangest thing about seeing a living Ivory-billed Woodpecker was 
that it was just a bird, albeit a magnificent one, going about its life in 
the swamp. We humans tend to project our angst about the damage we have done 
to our natural world on icons of loss, like the ivorybill. Happily, the bird 
I saw was doing fine. He was cruising around a beautiful world, on a 
beautiful day, and although he may have been wondering if there was a female 
around, or how his little family was doing, he wasn't burdened with gloomy 
thoughts of extinction. That is our burden to bear.</em></p></blockquote><p>UPDATE 3:&nbsp; The Science article is now <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1114103">online</a>.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The Texas legislature is acting soon on the alleged &quot;<a href="../../2005/04/yet_more_antilo.html">property rights</a>&quot; bill that in actuality forces taxpayers to pay real estate developers to behave responsibly and not pollute our water.&nbsp; This is the &quot;takings&quot; bill being pushed by GOP Agriculture Commissioner <a href="../../2005/04/extortion.html">Susan Combs</a> and the deceptive group of real estate developers and land speculators that calls themselves the <a href="../../2005/04/what_is_the_tex.html">Texas Landowners Conservancy</a> and that hides their personal monetary interests behind a false front of concern for the environment.</p>



<p>In fact, it appears the House may be acting <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/cgi-bin/db2www/tlo/billhist/actions.d2w/report?LEG=79&amp;SESS=R&amp;CHAMBER=H&amp;BILLTYPE=B&amp;BILLSUFFIX=02833">today</a> on their version, <strong><a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/#">HB 2833</a></strong>.&nbsp; Please call your state representative as soon as possible.&nbsp; Information on state representatives is available at this <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/fyi/fyi.htm">link</a>.</p>

<p>The state Senate looks to be holding a <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/cgi-bin/db2www/tlo/billhist/actions.d2w/report?LEG=79&amp;SESS=R&amp;CHAMBER=S&amp;BILLTYPE=B&amp;BILLSUFFIX=01647">public hearing</a> today on their version, <strong>SB 1647</strong>.&nbsp; Please call your state senator as well.&nbsp; Again, see this <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/fyi/fyi.htm">link</a> for information on state senators.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/">Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance</a> summarizes HB 2833 like this:</p><blockquote><p><em>This bill would require the Cities to PAY landowners
when they develop their property at less than 45% impervious cover
(impervious cover is rooftops, building, roads). San Antonio, Austin,
San Marcos and other cities limit impervious cover to 15% to 20% in the
most sensitive areas of the watershed. This bill would make taxpayers
pay the difference in profits when the city ordinances apply. The
legislators behind this bill have said that taxpayers should pay
developers when water quality protections cut into developer profits,
and we don't have a right to clean water.</em></p></blockquote><p>The only thing these bills do is preserve the ability of real estate developers and land speculators to make a fortune at the expense of the taxpayers' ability to protect their water quality.&nbsp; Please read my three previous posts on this issue for more on the story behind this piece of legislative extortion:&nbsp; <a href="../../2005/04/yet_more_antilo.html">Paying polluters not to pollute</a>, <a href="../../2005/04/what_is_the_tex.html">What is the Texas Landowners Conservancy</a>, and <a href="../../2005/04/extortion.html">Extortion and the Ag Commissioner</a>.

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A couple days ago, I pointed out how one 
<a href="../../2005/04/equal_pay_day_a.html">very common excuse</a> 
heard from wage gap deniers is false:&nbsp; the idea
that women earn less than men because women take large amounts of time off from their
careers.&nbsp; The final nail in the coffin for that myth is a 
<a href="http://www.house.gov/maloney/issues/womenscaucus/2003EarningsReport.pdf">GAO report</a>
from 2003 that performs a detailed analysis of salary data for men and women, 
controlling for numerous independent variables such as annual hours worked, 
time out of the labor force, work experience, highest education achieved, industry, 
and more.&nbsp; Controlling for all those variables, the study still 
found a pay gap of over 20% between men and women in the year 2000.

</p>

<p>It didn't take long for me to find the myth still being propagated.&nbsp; The very next day,
a conservative contributor to the blog 
<a href="https://polaroppositepolitics.blogspot.com/2005/04/intellectually-consistent.html">Polar Opposite Politics</a> 
quoted another blog saying:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
When I am confronted with evidence that women earn less than men 
I do not take this as a sign of discrimination. 
Instead, I point out that if you add to the regression a variable 
measuring continuous attachment to the work-force the difference 
in wages fades away.</em></p></blockquote><p>

I pointed out the data directly contradicting this statement, 
and that got us started in a conversation about this 
issue (at both his blog and mine), as he continued to insist that the wage gap 
could be &quot;easily explained away&quot; by women's choices.

</p>

<p>One weakness of the GAO study is that it only controlled for occupation via broad
categories such as &quot;professional, technical&quot; and &quot;nonfarm laborers.&quot;&nbsp; But this does
not mean the wage gap can be explained away be different occupational 
choices by men and women within these broad categories.&nbsp; Further studies 
demonstrate that the wage gap persists even in much more specific occupational 
categories.&nbsp; In fact, a significant pay differential exists in virtually every single such category.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/censr-15.pdf">Census Bureau</a> released a study in May 2004 entitled &quot;Evidence From Census 2000
About Earnings by Detailed Occupation for Men and Women.&quot;&nbsp; On page 12, it states:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
Fifteen of the 20 listed [highest-paid] occupations for men appear
on the list [of the 20 highest-paid occupations] for women, and in all cases,
the female median is less than that for men.&nbsp; In fact, the occupation third on
the list for women makes the same as the occupation last on the list for men ($67,000).
A similar pattern is shown for the lowest-paid occupations (Table 6).&nbsp; Sixteen
occupations appear on both lists, and in all cases but one ... women make less than
men in the same occupation.
</em></p></blockquote><p>

In only 11 out of 422 detailed occupations with 10,000 or more year-round full-time workers
did the Census Bureau find that female median earnings were statistically indistinguishable 
from male median earnings.

</p>

<p>Among the highest-paid occupations:&nbsp; women physicians and surgeons earn 63% of what men do;
women dentists, 62%; women judges, magistrates, and other judicial workers, 57%; 
women actuaries, 70%; women economists, 82%; women chemical engineers, 80%; women chief
executives, 63%.

</p>

<p>Among the lowest-paid occupations:&nbsp; women dishwashers earn 86% of what men do; women farmers
and ranchers, 60%; women cooks, 88%; women maids and housekeeping cleaners, 79%;
women teacher assistants, 75%.

</p>

<p>Take this Census data, across 411 out of 422 detailed occupations, combine it with
the GAO study that controls for numerous independent variables, and the existence of
a wage gap that is not &quot;easily explained away&quot; is readily apparent.

</p>

<p>Unfortunately, discrimination, both the overt kind and the more subtle, social-pressure, kind,
cannot be measured via studies like these.&nbsp; No one admits to purposefully paying women less
for equivalent work.&nbsp; (After all, it is technically against the law these days.)
So those who seek to deny the significance of discrimination continue waving their hands
and inventing more and more excuses for the huge amounts of data that demonstrate
the large pay differential between men and women.

</p>

<p>Perhaps, as the Census Bureau hypothesizes for the pay gap for physicians and surgeons,
&quot;different degrees of specialization within an occupation and different choices
of industry or business organization may affect the ratio.&nbsp; For example, women might
choose more frequently than men to practice in lower-paid medical specialties (such as
pediatrics) or in lower-paid institutional settings (such as health maintenance organizations).&quot;

</p>

<p>Even if this were so, which is not at all clear, and even if this were purely due
to women's personal preferences, which again is not at all clear, this argument cannot
be plausibly extended across 411 out of 422 occupations.&nbsp; &nbsp;Alas, experience shows 
that this does not stop the wage gap deniers from trying.

</p>

<p>The GAO, in concluding their study, 
offers up some further speculative straws for the wage gap deniers to grasp:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
Some experts believe that women and men generally have different life priorities—women
choose to place higher priority on home and family, while men choose to place higher 
priority on career and earnings.&nbsp; 
These women may voluntarily give up potential for higher earnings
to focus on home and family.
</em></p></blockquote><p>

This non-expert, but very interested observer, finds that argument extremely unconvincing.&nbsp; 
In this country, women have a long history of being underpaid 
relative to men for the same work.&nbsp; 
Has it all suddenly ended in the last 20 years?&nbsp; 
Both anecdotal evidence and the hard data strongly suggest not.</p>
