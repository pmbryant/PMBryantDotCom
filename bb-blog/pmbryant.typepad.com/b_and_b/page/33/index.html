				<p>We attended the first San Antonio Blogfest on Saturday and had a blast meeting fellow bloggers, of all political stripes.&nbsp; Ranten N. Raven and his wife did the heavy lifting in organizing this event.&nbsp; He has a report, including photos, at <a href="http://www.robinjuhl.homelinux.net/weblog/pivot/entry.php?id=628">The View from the Nest</a>.&nbsp; Alas, no one seems to have captured a picture of their teenage son plastering Raven with a water balloon or two.&nbsp; Mike Thomas, who was there with his wife and young son, also has a report at <a href="https://rhetoricrhythm.blogspot.com/2005/06/alamo-city-blogfest-2005.html">Rhetoric &amp; Rhythm</a>, while Roscoe Ellis has some photos <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/roscoe/sets/498993/">here</a> and also at his LiveJournal blog <a href="http://arellis49.livejournal.com/">here</a>.</p>



<p>It was a great pleasure and honor meeting all of them, as well as Eddie Rodriguez from <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/">The Red State</a> and Julia Hayden (Sgt Mom) from <a href="http://www.sgtstryker.com/">The Daily Brief</a>.&nbsp; Alas, we arrived just a bit too late to meet Matt from <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com">Just Another Blog</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the combustible ideological mix (which seems extremely unusual, if not unique, amongst gatherings organized over the internet), it all seems to have come off quite well.&nbsp; I am looking forward to a second installment, perhaps later this year.</p>

				<p>Will there be a &quot;Bush Plan&quot; to get Iraq out of its currently <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/middleeast/articles/2005/06/24/hope_eludes_baghdad_residents/">troubled situation</a> and <a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2005-06-24T214431Z_01_KNE478258_RTRUKOC_0_IRAQ-USA.xml">back on its feet</a>?</p><blockquote><p><em>[Iraq Prime Minister Ibrahim al-] Jaafari pressed for a long-term U.S. commitment for assistance to help with reconstruction and debt relief.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;We
hope that Mr. Bush will try to redo a Marshall Plan, calling it the
Bush plan, to help Iraq, to help the Iraqi people. And this would be a
very wonderful step that they stand beside us,&quot; he said. He was
referring to the U.S. investment plan for helping rebuild Europe after
World War Two.</em></p></blockquote><p>What does the White House think of that idea?&nbsp; From today's <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050624-3.html">press briefing</a> by Press Secretary Scott McClellan:</p><blockquote><p><em> Q&nbsp; &nbsp; The Prime Minister talked about perhaps a Bush Plan, likening
it to the Marshall Plan that helped rebuild Europe after World War II.
And when the President was asked about reconstruction, he said of
course, the U.S. is devoting resources, but the job belongs to the
Iraqi people.&nbsp; Is there a different outlook between the Iraq Prime
Minister and the President about the building of infrastructure?
</em></p>

<p><em> MR. McCLELLAN:&nbsp; Well, I'll let him talk further about what he was
talking about.&nbsp; But if you'll recall, there was an international
conference earlier this week, more than 80 nations coming together to
show their strong support for the Iraqi people.&nbsp; The international
community is standing with the Iraqi people, and they talked about in
their meetings -- both in the Oval Office and in the residence during
the lunch -- about the importance of the international community
continuing to support the Iraqi people and the transitional government
as they move forward on this historic transformation that is taking
place.&nbsp; And we've been, as the Prime Minister pointed out, providing
tremendous support from the United States for the Iraqi people.
</em></p>

<p><em> One issue that I imagine will continue to come up is the issue of
debt relief.&nbsp; And there's a donor's conference coming up in Jordan here
shortly, as the President talked about.&nbsp; So I think you're seeing that
the international community is sending a strong message of support for
the transitional government and for the Iraqi people.&nbsp; There are a
number that have come forward with commitments, there are a number that
have made commitments --&nbsp; and we hope that they will move forward
quickly to fulfill those commitments, because it's vital that we
continue to stand with the Iraqi people as they move forward to meet
their political objectives, which they are doing.&nbsp; The President talked
about that.</em></p></blockquote><p>As best I can figure, that's a longwinded, polite brush off.&nbsp; He said, is essence, 'Others are taking care of it.'&nbsp; So Iraqis should not expect much leadership from the Bush administration on this issue.</p>

				<p>The coward Karl Rove, chief henchman of the Bush regime, continues the campaign to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,1280,-5095929,00.html">smear their fellow Americans</a>, while his bosses <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200506/s1399903.htm">miserably botch the fight</a> against our true enemies.</p>

<p>I heartily echo Todd Gitlin's words at <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/6/23/12272/6122">TPMCafe</a> yesterday:</p><blockquote><p><em><a target="_self" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/23/politics/23rove.html">Karl Rove's</a>
thuggery at last night's New York Conservative Party bash has to be
smacked down, but for far more than being what Chuck Schumer called
&quot;divisive.&quot;&nbsp; We <em>need </em>to &quot;divide&quot; the country against the likes of Rove.&nbsp; <br /><br /> This is the true face of the Bush crowd:&nbsp; extremism in pursuit of vice.</em></p></blockquote><p>No <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/06/24/MNGHTDEBNN1.DTL">mere apology</a> from Rove can cure the cancer at the heart of the Bush administration.&nbsp; Bush himself should resign, and take his entire administration with him.&nbsp; The longer they remain in power, the more dangerous the world becomes, the less safe this country becomes, and the more Americans and others will die.</p><blockquote><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/24/politics/24military.html"><strong>U.S. General Sees No Ebb in Fight</strong></a> 

</p>

<p><em>WASHINGTON, June 23 - The top American commander for the Middle East
said Thursday that the insurgency in Iraq had not diminished, seeming
to contradict statements by Vice President Dick Cheney in recent days
that the insurgents were in their &quot;last throes.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Though he declined during his Congressional testimony to comment
directly on Mr. Cheney's statements, the commander, Gen. John P.
Abizaid, said that more foreign fighters were coming into Iraq and that
the insurgency's &quot;overall strength is about the same&quot; as it was six
months ago. &quot;There's a lot of work to be done against the insurgency,&quot;
he added.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong><a href="http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N22675120.htm">CIA says Iraq is now a terrorist training ground</a>
&nbsp; </strong> </p>

<p><em>WASHINGTON, June 22 (Reuters) - The CIA believes the Iraq insurgency
poses an international threat and may produce better-trained Islamic
terrorists than the 1980s Afghanistan war that gave rise to Osama bin
Laden and al Qaeda, a U.S. counterterrorism official said on Wednesday.
<br /><br />A classified report from the U.S. spy agency says Iraqi and foreign
fighters are developing a broad range of deadly skills, from car
bombings and assassinations to tightly coordinated conventional attacks
on police and military targets, the official said.<br /></em></p></blockquote><p>If ever a President and his entire cabinet deserved to be impeached, it is now.&nbsp; This goes beyond corruption—all the way to incompetence—and is a true life-and-death matter.</p>

<p>The only conceivable way the Republican Congress would ever consider such an action is with tremendous pressure from the people who voted them into office.&nbsp; So, until November 2006, this is in in the hands of grassroots Republicans.&nbsp; Will they hold their leaders accountable?&nbsp; Or will they join Rove in shifting blame to their fellow Americans?</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The Supreme Court issued a controversial, 5-4, decision today on whether local governments can seize private property under eminent domain and hand the property over to a private entity for <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/23/AR2005062300783.html">economic development</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em><nitf></nitf><p>The Supreme Court today effectively expanded the right of
local governments to seize private property under eminent domain,
ruling that people's homes and businesses -- even those not considered
blighted -- can be taken against their will for private development if
the seizure serves a broadly defined &quot;public use.&quot;</p></em></p>

<p><em><nitf></nitf><p>In
a 5-4 decision [in the Kelo v. New London, Conn. case], the court upheld the ability of New London, Conn., to
seize people's homes to make way for an office, residential and retail
complex supporting a new $300 million research facility of the Pfizer
pharmaceutical company. The city had argued that the project served a
public use within the meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution because it would increase tax revenues,
create jobs and improve the local economy.</p></em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The immediate impact of this decision is disquieting.&nbsp; Why should governments have the power to seize people's homes?&nbsp; But governments do have that power, written right into the <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am5">Fifth Amendment</a>:&nbsp; &quot;nor shall private property be taken for public use, without
just compensation.&quot;&nbsp; So as long as just compensation is provided and that the takings is for public use, governments can apparently seize whatever they want—at least under the Constitution.&nbsp; And they've been doing so since the days of the founding fathers.</p>

<p>The real issue in this case was who gets to determine what is a &quot;public use&quot;:&nbsp; elected legislative bodies? or the courts?</p>

<p>The decision by the majority of the Supreme Court is, as I see it, a fundamentally <em>non-activist</em> decision.&nbsp; &nbsp;In determining what a &quot;public use&quot; is, the Supreme Court deferred to the judgement of elected officials.&nbsp; Legislative bodies more closely represent the people, and thus should be in better tune to what constitutes an appropriate public use.<br /> </p><blockquote><p><em>Writing for the majority, Justice John Paul Stevens said the case
turned on the question of whether New London's development plan served
a &quot;public purpose.&quot; He added, &quot;Without exception, our cases have
defined that concept broadly, reflecting our longstanding policy of
deference to legislative judgments in this field.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>The four justices in the minority supported an <em>activist</em> decision, that would have the unelected courts imposing their view of &quot;public use.&quot;&nbsp; Who were those four?&nbsp; The three conservative heroes—Scalia, Rehnquist, and Thomas—together with usual swing justice Sandra Day O'Connor.&nbsp; (Today the swing justice was Anthony Kennedy, who supported with the four more liberal members of the Court in issuing their non-activist decision.)</p>



<p>I have a hard time seeing how this case is much different, on the surface, from using eminent domain for urban renewal.&nbsp; And so today's decision is just a reaffirmation of the <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1105968938077">fifty-year old decision</a> that permitted that.&nbsp; If anything, today's decision made eminent domain a more equitable process, since now government can seize the land of more than just poor people.&nbsp; (If local governments abuse their broad powers of eminent domain, there are plenty of ways this can be dealt with, as discussed in section III of this <a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/gelpi/takings/courts/documents/APA-Keloamicusbrief_000.pdf">amicus brief</a> from the American Planning Association.)</p>

<p>The <em>Kelo v. New London</em> opinions illustrate how conservative jurists are the true judicial activists these days.&nbsp; I certainly do not want Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas and their ilk deciding what is an appropriate public use.</p>

<p>UPDATE (6:11 P.M.):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nathannewman.org/log/archives/003105.shtml">Nathan Newman</a> explains further why this was a very reasonable decision.</p>

<p>UPDATE (6-24, 12:16 P.M.):&nbsp; More reasoned opinions on the Kelo decision from <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/6/24/13026/7261">Matt Yglesias</a> and <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/takings_and_the.html">Scott Lemieux</a>.&nbsp; In particular, Matt Y. writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>If America wasn't a totalitarian dystopia yesterday, then it isn't
going to be one tomorrow in light of this ruling. Nothing has changed.
Perhaps you think it's </em>bad<em> that nothing has changed, but it's not really the moment to start pulling your hair out. It probably </em><em>is
the moment to start paying closer attention to City Council elections
which many people, myself included, tend not to scrutinize much. Those
people have real power and it's worth paying attention.</em></p></blockquote>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2005/06/a_recent_oped_i.html">Lowering the bar for Constitutional amendments</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A recent op-ed in the San Antonio Express-News argued for <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/stories/MYSA062005.5B.Levincomment.1c76b25b.html">lowering the bar</a> for passing new amendments to the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp; The author's rationale?&nbsp; To solve the controversy over control of the judicial branch.</p><blockquote><p><em>
The controversy that now embroils our judiciary is a result of judges 
effectively amending the Constitution to create new rights, like abortion. While reading out of the Constitution rights specifically enumerated, such as the right to bear arms, some might say these changes are positive and reflect the evolution of public opinion, but if they had been made through the formal amendment process rather than by judges, a judge's political views would be irrelevant and judicial selection would be a noncontroversial task of finding the best lawyers to faithfully interpret the Constitution as if it were a contract.</em></p></blockquote><p>The author, Marc A. Levin, while merely described as &quot;an attorney in Austin&quot; in his tag, is a <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2004-06-04/pols_feature3.html">conservative activist</a> and heavily involved with pro-corporate <a href="http://www.texaspolicy.com/staff_member.php?staff_id=32">think</a> <a href="http://www.politicalusa.com/columnists/levin/default.htm">tanks</a>.&nbsp; From his article, he clearly would like to see new amendments of a conservative bent.&nbsp; Presumably the Equal Rights Amendment is not high on his priority list.</p>

<p>While there might be a reasonable argument for making it easier to amend the Constitution, Levin's particular argument strikes me as half-baked.&nbsp; Even if there were a problem such as the author claims, it would not be solved by adding new amendments to the Constitution.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Activist judges, whoever and whereever they may be, would still be able to &quot;create new rights.&quot;&nbsp; Or, as I would put it, activist judges would still be able to invalidate corporate regulations based on archaic readings of the Constitution.&nbsp; By definition, &quot;activist&quot; judges are not restrained by the text in the Constitution and its amendments.</p>

<p>Levin goes on to argue that since so few amendments have been passed in recent decades,&nbsp; the process is simply too hard.&nbsp; But there are twenty-seven amendments, so clearly it is not impossible.&nbsp; Perhaps the lack of recent successful amendments is a symptom that most of the country is satisfied with the Constitution in its current form?</p>

<p>Despite the occasional, lamentable, failure of worthwhile amendments, such as the Equal Rights Amendment, I believe that the difficulty of amending the U.S. Constitution—and the stability thereby provided—is one of the reasons why our Constitution has been so successful.&nbsp; Adopting Levin's proposal would make it easier for temporary political majorities to work their will with the fundamental document of our nation.&nbsp; One decade abortion is a constitutional right; the next it is not.&nbsp; One decade corporations have extensive constitutional protections; the next they do not.&nbsp; Fundamental human and civil rights could be taken away, then given back, then taken away again.&nbsp; Think of the alcohol-prohibition amendment in 1919 and its repeal in 1933, but with many more issues and much more often.<br /> </p>

<p>Respect for the Constitution would gradually wither.&nbsp; The result would be quite detrimental to the long-term survival of our Constitutional republic.</p>

				<p>Does Bill Frist have a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/21/AR2005062100117.html?sub=AR">mind of his own</a>?</p><blockquote><p><em><nitf></nitf><p>WASHINGTON -- Reversing field after a meeting with President

<p><em><nitf></nitf><p>Talking
to reporters in the White House driveway after he joined other GOP

very clear that he expects an up or down vote.&quot;</p></em></p>

<p><em>Just about two hours hour earlier, Frist said he wouldn't schedule
another vote on Bolton's nomination and said that Bush must decide the

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I read a story that should be of interest to birders and others interested in nature in the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA061805.1B.bird_relocation.1d6d1f62.html">San Antonio Express-News</a> over the weekend.&nbsp; Swallows have artfully adapted to using human structures on which to build their homes.&nbsp; But what happens when the humans decide that a particular structure, still useful to the swallows, has outlived its usefulness to the humans?</p><blockquote><p><em>
As their parents zoomed about in apparent confusion and distress, almost 100 young cave swallows and eggs were removed from a doomed highway overpass and resettled by wildlife specialists on Friday.
</em></p>

<p>
<em> Many of the baby birds had just hatched. They seemed to be all mouth atop tiny, pink fuzzy bodies. Others were fully feathered and looked ready to leave their nests. The white and speckled eggs were only a little larger than jelly beans.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Wildlife specialists placed the offspring in shoeboxes and drove them to a nearby highway bridge where they were inserted into the nests of other cave swallows, which took to them as if they were their own. Four of the fledglings opted to fly off rather than be raised by foster parents.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>...
</em></p>

<p>
<em> The rush to demolish the westbound and eastbound lanes of Loop 410 where it rises over South Zarzamora Street ruffled a few feathers.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Lynn Cuny, executive director of Wildlife Rescue &amp; Rehabilitation, a nonprofit wildlife rescue agency out of Kendalia that led the relocation effort, questioned the state's decision to evict the birds rather than hold off for a few weeks.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;We tried to get the project to wait until the birds moved themselves,&quot; she said. &quot;This is going to be a real sad day for these birds because they're losing their families.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Cuny said her group was the only one in the region authorized to handle federally protected migratory birds and has never before been asked by the state to move any.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;It's scary to think how many times this has happened where the bridges went down with the babies in the nest,&quot; she said.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Angela Grimes, the wildlife rescue agency's operations director, said the toughest part was watching one pair of swallow parents perch right where their nest had been.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Grimes imagined what must have been running through their minds: &quot;'They were just here. Where are my babies?' That's what is so wrong about this.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The rescue group doesn't expect the baby birds to be reunited with their parents. 
</em></p></blockquote><p>For fellow bird lovers, it seems distressing that this would be done at a time when the swallows are raising their young, but I get that impression that for any consideration at all to be given to birds during overpass work of this sort is new.&nbsp; And for this new concern, we can apparently thank Valerie Collins, a wildlife biologist hired by the Texas Department of Transportation.</p>

<p></p><blockquote><p><em>
Collins said she took a lot of guff from colleagues and others over her insistence that no swallows be killed.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;I'm a laughingstock,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm the bird lady.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Collins said that whenever an overpass is set for destruction, netting or a special kind of barbed wire should be put up to force the swallows, which habitually return to the same nesting site each year, to build their little nests of mud elsewhere.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Collins said she hopes state employees and others learned a lesson.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;If this is a big pain, then maybe they'll do it right next time,&quot; she said. </em></p></blockquote>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Some good news for the weekend.&nbsp; In California's central valley, an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/wire/sns-ap-songbirds-return,1,5527407.story?coll=sns-ap-science-headlines">endangered songbird</a> is making a comeback and showing up in places it hasn't been seen in decades, thanks to efforts at land restoration:</p><blockquote><p><em>FRESNO, Calif. -- A chatty songbird thought to have disappeared from
the Central Valley 60 years ago has been spotted nesting in a patch of
restored habitat along the San Joaquin River. <br /><br />The
least Bell's vireo, a little gray songbird that fits in a closed fist,
was once widespread in the Central Valley. It disappeared from the area
as the riparian habitat it favors was ripped up to make way for
development and agriculture. About 90 percent of the valley's historic
riverside vegetation has been lost, said Al Donner, spokesman for the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<br /><br />The bird was put on the federal endangered species list in 1986, when
there were only about 300 pairs left in the low-lying shrubbery along
creeks and streams in southern California.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Dropping her equipment, [seasonal biologist for the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge, Linette] Lina focused her binoculars on the bird -- a
male perched on a branch about 30 feet away, singing and shaking his
tail feathers. As she called her supervisor about the discovery, a
female joined him and did a copulation dance. <br /><br />Further
investigation showed the nesting pair was feeding two baby birds, which
were just learning to fly, said Lina, who does bird counts and
observation for the Point Reyes Bird Observatory Conservation Science.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The area where they were found had been a ranch, which was bought in
1998 and restored over the last three years by Fish and Wildlife with
help from the state of California.</em></p></blockquote><p>It must be immensely satisfying for these biologists to see the fruits of the efforts of years of hard restoration work.</p>

<p>A blog called <a href="http://www.faultline.org/place/toad/archive/2005_06.html">Toad in the Hole</a> has an email from a couple days ago from
within the federal Fish &amp; Wildlife Service announcing this
discovery.&nbsp; Also, <a href="https://girlscientist.blogspot.com/">Hedwig</a> has a pointer to this story in her current edition of <a href="https://girlscientist.blogspot.com/2005/06/birds-in-news-15.html">Birds in the News</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.umich.edu/~esupdate/library/97.07-08/contents.html"><img width="100" height="63" border="0" src="../../images/leastbellsvireoumich_1.jpg" title="Leastbellsvireoumich_1" alt="Leastbellsvireoumich_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>As a result of the destruction of much of their riparian habitat over the latter half of the twentieth century, least Bell's vireos had been confined to <a href="http://www.werc.usgs.gov/sandiego/flycat.html">southern California</a>—in particular the Camp Pendleton area in San Diego County.&nbsp; Habitat loss and also nest-parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds reduced the vireos numbers into the hundreds by the mid-1980s.</p>

<p>Fortunately, efforts to <a href="https://pacific.fws.gov/news/1998/9850nr.htm">control cowbirds</a> and preserve and restore habitat have increased the numbers of least Bell's vireos to <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2005/02/28/special_reports/science_technology/10_12_222_26_05.txt">around 3000</a> these days.&nbsp; And with that increase, they have been expanding back north into their former range.&nbsp; So perhaps this exciting discovery in the central valley should not be all that surprising.</p>

<p>For those who aren't familiar with cowbirds, here is a description of their <a href="http://www.audubon.org/bird/research/">parasitic behavior</a> from the Audubon Society:</p><blockquote><p><em>Instead of building their own nests, incubating their own eggs and
raising their own nestlings, Brown-headed Cowbirds have a different
breeding strategy. Cowbird females use other bird species as hosts --
laying their eggs in the nests of other bird species and relying on
these hosts to incubate and raise their chicks.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Brown-headed Cowbirds occupy most of North America south of the Arctic,
but this large range has occurred only recently and is the result of
human-induced factors. Prior to the arrival of Europeans in North
America, cowbirds were nomadic, following the large herds of bison that
roamed across the Great Plains.</em></p></blockquote><p>When their nests are parasitized, tiny vireos and other songbird parents end up feeding chicks bigger than they are.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, cowbirds are a major problem for far more bird species than just the least Bell's vireo.&nbsp; For instance, here in central Texas, they are a major reason why the black-capped vireo is an endangered species.</p>

<p>But for today at least, we can celebrate the least Bell's vireo return to its old home in California's central valley.</p>

				<p>Blogger and D.C. politico Matthew Yglesias has <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/6/16/13119/3070">arrived in Texas</a>—Fort Worth specifically—for apparently the first time in his still young life:</p><blockquote><p><em>My flight got in an hour earlier than I thought it would thanks to the time zone change (like a typical east coast elitist, I think I subconciously assumed there was just a big leap from Eastern Time to Pacific Time somewhere over the rockies) and so far the very small portion of the Metroplex I've seen utterly fails to live up to stereotype. DFW airport looks like . . . an airport! The Fort Worth suburbs driven through en route to downtown look like . . . suburbs! Downtown Fort Worth seems lovely, nobody says &quot;howdy!&quot; (n.b., my Texas-born roommate is constantly saying &quot;howdy!&quot;) or wears outlandish hats. Main difference is that the Starbucks has SBC WiFi instead of TMobile WiFi. Also, the coffee is substantially cheaper than in NYC, DC, or Boston.<br /><br />...</em></p>

<p><em>I'm beginning to think this whole Red versus Blue thing is even more all hype than it obviously was already. </em></p></blockquote><p>While I'm happy to see Matt debunking the &quot;whole <a href="../../2004/11/abandon_all_tal.html">Red</a> versus <a href="../../2004/11/yet_another_rea.html">Blue</a> thing,&quot; his impression of Texas is going to be very superficial if he sticks to airports, suburbs, and Starbucks.&nbsp; To get a broader view,&nbsp; albeit one still lacking in outlandish hats, perhaps he should travel on down here to San Antonio—or as one <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/rstinson/stories/MYSA061205.3A.stinson.305344313.html">local columnist</a> now describes it:</p><blockquote><p><em><p>
BERKELEY SOUTHWEST.
</p>
<p>
If you think the 2003-2005 City Council occasionally deteriorated into a political circus, wait till you see its successor when there is no Ed Garza, Enrique Barrera or Carroll Schubert around to limit the liberal wackiness.</p></em></p></blockquote><p>Who knew Deep Red Texas could see liberal wackiness in this day and age?</p>

<p>Perhaps someone should point out to columnist Roddy Stinson, though, that he really should be calling us BERKELEY SOUTHEAST.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Local blog <a href="http://allthingsconservative.typepad.com/all_things_conservative/2005/06/yay_global_warm.html">All Things Conservative</a> has a post about a recent article from a British newspaper, the Telegraph, that claims that global warming will bring about plenty of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/06/12/nwarm12.xml">good things</a>. </p>

<p>If only.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.organicmatter.net/node/131">Organic Matter</a> has already laid into portions of the article.&nbsp; But I can't resist commenting further.</p>

<p>&quot;Global warming is good.&quot;&nbsp; This is actually an old talking point.&nbsp; In fact, an entire organization exists to promote it: the pleasant-sounding <a href="http://www.greeningearthsociety.org/">Greening Earth Society</a>, funded by the <a href="http://www.westernfuels.org/">Western Fuels Association</a>.&nbsp; Yes, the coal industry.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Telegraph article, focusing on these alleged benefits of global warming, fails to mention any real benefits that apply outside of northern, fairly wealthy countries such as the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada, and the United States.&nbsp; And some of the benefits for those countries that it mentions are pathetically meager:</p><blockquote><p><em>Last year, a team at the University of Hamburg showed
that a modest temperature rise would lead to 30 per cent more tourists
visiting countries such as Russia and Canada.</em></p>

<p><em>The
benefits to UK tourism may also be substantial, according to a recent
study by the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia,
which concluded: &quot;We may witness not only an expansion in the domestic
market, but an expansion in the inbound international market as the UK
develops a more Mediterranean climate.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Left unsaid is the distinct possibility that climate change brought on by global warming could end up shutting down the Atlantic gulf stream that currently keeps northern Europe far warmer than most other areas at such high latitudes.&nbsp; But perhaps the UK could develop a new skiing industry to attract tourists in that case.</p>

<p>After all, as the article points out, humans are endlessly adaptable, and we really shouldn't sell them short.</p><blockquote><p><em>Climate scientists have made little of the benefits of a warming
planet, and even less of the ability of humans to cope with the
consequences. From the changes in irrigation and new crops made by
American farmers that prevented a repetition of the 1930s Dust Bowl, to
the sea-wall system that protects northern Vietnam, there is no lack of
evidence for human inventiveness in the face of climate change.</em></p></blockquote><p>Left unsaid is how much this coping will cost, and how much human suffering will take place in the meantime.&nbsp; A repetition of the Dust Bowl was avoided, but wouldn't it have been better to have prevented it in the first place?</p>

<p>The low point of the article comes with a quote from Philip Stott, emeritus professor of biogeography at the University of London.</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;If you could vote for a change in climate, you would always want a
warmer one,&quot; says Philip Stott, emeritus professor of biogeography at
the University of London. &quot;Cold is nearly always worse for everything -
the economy, agriculture, disease, biodiversity&quot;.</em></p></blockquote><p>As Organic Matter puts it, this is &quot;surprisingly idiotic.&quot;&nbsp; I would prefer not to use such harsh words (especially since Professor Stott has his own <a href="https://greenspin.blogspot.com/">blog</a>!), but the fellow at Organic Matter does have a point.&nbsp; What would Stott's vote be if given a choice between the Little Ice Age of a few centuries ago and, say, the planet Venus?</p>

<p>Back on Earth, the climate is a lot more complicated than simple choices between &quot;warm&quot; climates and &quot;cold&quot; ones.&nbsp; Stott also neglects that we are starting from a period as warm or warmer than any other period in at least the last <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=122">thousand years</a>.</p>

<p>The only interesting point the Telegraph article brings up is global warming's effect upon agriculture.&nbsp; But even here, the article overemphasizes modest potential benefits in northern, wealthy nations, while neglecting the almost certain downsides for agriculture in developing countries.&nbsp; This is an interesting subject, though, that I am now inspired to learn more about.</p>

<p>Finally, the article closes with the old canard, from Professor Stott, about how doing anything to combat emissions of greenhouse gases and reduce global warming will destroy the global economy.</p><blockquote><p><em>Even if we shut every fossil-fuel power station, crushed every car and
grounded every aircraft, the Earth's climate would still continue to
get warmer, according to Prof Stott. &quot;The trouble is, we would all be
too impoverished to cope with the consequences,&quot; he said.</em></p></blockquote><p>Someone tell Stott not to worry—no one is proposing any such actions!&nbsp; Developing the new energy technologies that necessary to reduce greenhouse gases should be a net economic boon, as almost all innovative work is.&nbsp; Someone with the supreme confidence in human invention that Stott has should be able to see that.</p>

<p>On his blog, <a href="https://greenspin.blogspot.com/2005_06_12_greenspin_archive.html#111885458982133953">Stott</a> wrote yesterday:</p><blockquote><p><em>It is nearly obscene, with all our resources, to think that we shall not be able to adapt once again - <span style="font-style: italic;">unless, that is, we have lost our evolutionary dynamism and drive</span>.</em></p></blockquote><p>With that attitude, Stott should feel comfortable with our ability to adapt to using the new energy sources necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
