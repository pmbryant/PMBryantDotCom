			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>As I wrote about <a href="../../2006/01/new_years_snowy.html#comment-13044452">earlier</a>, our New Years' Day Seattle-area, Skagit River delta, Hayton Reserve birding adventure gave us the opportunity to eye a rare Snowy Owl, thanks to the help of some knowledgeable local birders.  These same birders also mentioned that a Short-eared Owl had been reported a couple miles away.  After enjoying our view of the mottled black and white Snowy Owl, perched on a log a couple hundred feet away, we decided to venture down the road to see if we could luck out again and spot yet another life bird for us.</p>

<p><a href="../../../photos/uncategorized/baldeaglespot430.jpg"><img class="image-full" alt="Baldeaglespot430" title="Baldeaglespot430" src="../../../photos/uncategorized/baldeaglespot430.jpg" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The location was beyond the end of a road, on the edges of yet more driftwood-covered shorelines.  Arriving there, we realized the futility of trying to find the putative Short-eared Owl.  This landscape was even more confusing than the previous one.  And this owl, unlike the Snowy, would not stand out from the innumerable dead logs strewn about the coast.  Worst of all, we didn't have an army of experienced local birders with scopes to do the work for us.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we headed out, hoping to see something cool in this foreign landscape.  The idea that Bald Eagles, another potential life bird for us, were especially common in this river valley in the winter remained in the back of our minds.  </p>

<p>We walked along a linear stretch of high ground paralleling the coast of Puget Sound, several hundred feet away.  In the middle distance, small but precipitous islands rose dramatically out of the bay.  The overcast skies had turned a darker gray since we left the Snowy Owl viewpoint.  The wind persisted in gusting across the wide-open spaces, occasionally threatening to knock us off our feet.</p>

<p>Learning my lesson from our time at the Hayton Reserve, I pulled out my ski gloves from the back of the car, so as to preserve my hands for holding binoculars for a longer time.  </p>

<p>The first birds we saw were hawks of some type, several of them, but all likely the same species.  We got very good looks, from far and from close.  They had a very prominent white rump, but otherwise were generally dark.  When one made a particularly close approach, flying at about eye-level a few dozen feet in front of us, a rusty coloring on its shoulders and the underside of its wings near its body stood out.  We noticed some other field marks as well, and figured picking it out of a field guide later should be straightforward.  As usual, that wasn't the case, but now I believe these were Northern Harriers, also known as "Marsh Hawks."  The habitat certainly fit their nickname.</p>

<p>As we walked along the dike, hunters, in traditional camouflage, waded into the shallows of the bay not far away.  A couple strolled back to their cars, carrying a bloodied, dead, white Snow Goose by the neck.</p>

<p>Far in the distance, a great number of water birds were swimming or wading in the bay.  It would have been a sizeable walk to get close enough to get a decent view of these birds without a scope, and the weather was not improving.  So instead, we stopped our forward progress, and made a few cursory scans of the driftwood surrounding us hoping to get lucky and spot the Short-eared Owl.  Of course, we saw no such thing.  Or if we did, we certainly didn't notice it.  </p>

<p>We did, however, spot another raptor flying over the water, and trained our binoculars on it, expecting another one of those white-rumped hawks that were so abundant.  Immediately upon focusing, however, it was clear that this bird had a very white head and very white tail.  Any American would immediately recognize it as our national symbol, the Bald Eagle. </p>

<p>The eagle was not content to just fly around letting us get a good look at him, the first we had seen in the wild.  He had work to do.  He swooped down onto the surface of the water, quickly emerging with some kind of prey, likely a fish of some sort, that we could not quite make out.  Barely pausing, the eagle flew off in the direction from which it had come, holding its next meal in its talons.  It flew purposefully past the camouflaged hunters, not far off the ground, towards a more isolated stretch of shore that must have been a quarter-mile away from us.  There, it finally landed, presumably to commence its dinner.</p>

<p>As we lowered our binoculars to exclaim to each other at what a neat show this eagle had put on for us, a solid wall of wind blasted us from behind, practically shoving us off the raised dike.  This gust did not let up.  With it, the earlier occasional drizzle turned into heavier drops of horizontal rain that felt like ice pellets pummeling our backs.  </p>

<p>Balancing ourselves in the gale, we looked behind us and saw that the Cascade foothills had completely disappered into the deep gray of an approaching storm.  We suspended our hawk and eagle watching and high-tailed it back for our car.</p>

<p>The weather had put an abrupt end to our birding outing.  The next day we saw several more Bald Eagles before finally having to return to Texas the day after.  But nothing could match the thrill of seeing our first in the act of fishing along the shores of Puget Sound.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Science policy journalist and author of the best-selling book, <a href="http://www.waronscience.com/home.php">The Republican War on Science</a>, Chris Mooney had some <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2006/01/santorum_cant_run_away_from_id.php">suggestions</a> for scientists late last week:<blockquote><em>I have long thought that, if science supporters want a political scalp, [Pennsylvania Republican Senator Rick] Santorum ought to be on their top list of targets. He's a strong sympathizer with anti-evolutionists, and thus on the wrong side of what is easily the most clear-cut political science issue of the day. Moreover, he's politically vulnerable. If Santorum goes down and scientists in Pennsylvania have rallied against him (something I've seen no evidence of as yet), presumably they can then claim some of the credit. And that, in turn, might deter future politicians from supporting anti-science causes. </p>

<p>Of course, if Santorum is dead anyway politically, it may not count as much of a victory. But the experience might nevertheless teach scientists a thing or two about engaging in politics in defense of scientific integrity and, especially, the theory of evolution. When it comes to politics, scientists really are in need of basic training.</em></blockquote>Mooney is advocating that, not just science supporters, but scientists themselves organize to get involved in the grind of personal, partisan politics&#151;targeting individual candidates for defeat in attempts to claim their "political scalp."  I think this would be an extremely counter-productive activity that, contrary to Mooney's goal, would almost certainly destroy the strong and respected position that scientists and science currently have in the United States.</p>

<p>In surveys, science consistently shows up as one of the most respected professions.  Even from this exalted position, scientists still have an extremely hard time teaching the public and policy makers anything beyond the mere basics of scientific knowledge, and sometimes haven't even been successful at that.   </p>

<p>On the other hand, politics consistently shows up as one of the least respected professions.  A substantial fraction of the people in this country, probably the vast majority, do not trust a thing politicians and their ardent supporters say.  </p>

<p>If scientists were to participate en masse in the personal details of partisan politics, rather than elevating the respectability of politics by doing so, it is far more likely that scientists' credibility to the public at large would be irreparably damaged.  Scientific results would be dismissed out-of-hand by huge groups of people merely based on whoever the authors, or the authors' political organization, had supported in previous campaigns.  Few things are as capable of shutting off people's logic circuits as political accusations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, given the dominant role government money plays in research funding, explicit politicization of large groups of scientists would likely turn scientific research into just another patronage program, with elected officials doling out money to scientists who then support their campaigns.</p>

<p>Scientists should continue to speak out about important policy and educational issues for which their knowledge is crucial to informing the debate.  In fact, they should increase how much they do so.  And they should work harder at educating the general public about the scientific process as well as specific scientific knowledge.  But I believe they are being far-sighted by staying away from publicly choosing and supporting their favorite candidates&#151;and thereby frittering away their hard-earned social capital for short-term political gains.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Yikes.  Has it been twenty years already since the tragic launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger?</p>

<p>I was a space nut high-school senior at the time.  Too young to have witnessed the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab expoints of the 1960s and 1970s, I had latched onto the space shuttle program with a gusto bordering on obsession&#151an obsession that had begun before even its long-delayed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-1">first mission</a> flew, piloted by moon-walker John Young and rookie astronaut (at the time) Robert Crippen back in April 1981.</p>

<p>In the nearly five years since that maiden voyage, I had watched the shuttle program slowly build up momentum, finally appearing to break through with a glimmer of its original promise of routine access to low-Earth-orbit in the year 1985, when it flew a breathtaking nine missions, nearly twice as many as it had flown the previous year.  Combined with President Reagan's directive from early 1984 to complete a manned space station within a decade, the dreams of the post-Apollo space program appeared well on the way to fruition at last.</p>

<p>It was an embarrasment of riches for me that last week of January 1986.  On the previous Friday, the twenty-fourth, the unmanned probe Voyager 2 had flown by the planet Uranus, an encounter five years in the making since Voyager's last planetary flyby at Saturn.  It gave us the first close-up pictures of that exotic, previously unexplored world.  Then, on Sunday the twenty-sixth, my beloved Chicago Bears completed a dream season by demolishing my second-favorite team, the New England Patriots, in the Super Bowl.  To top it off, just two days later, the space shuttle prepared to make its second trip of the young year, launching barely two weeks after the end of the previous mission.  </p>

<p>The flip side of all the shuttle's recent success for space nuts like myself was that space travel was becoming far too routine for the general public to pay attention to.  After the plethora of shuttle missions over the previous couple years, TV networks were no longer willing to devote much coverage, even to launches, anymore.  In those pre-internet days, that made it very hard to follow all the day-to-day details of the space missions that I had become so hooked on in the first few years of the shuttle program.  Thankfully, the new phenomenon of cable television and CNN tried to fill in that gap.  The inclusion of an everyday school teacher on the Challenger mission also promised to attract much more attention from the networks than the last few missions.</p>

<p>In retrospect, virtually all our notions about the space shuttle back then were a mirage.  The shuttle simply was too complex to maintain that kind of launch schedule, much less the even busier ones imagined for the future.  With the deaths of seven heroes on NASA's hands, their expectactions came back down to ground and the shuttle never again flew as many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_space_shuttle_missions">missions</a> in a year as it had in 1985&#151;and never will.</p>

<p>But that was all still in the future that bright, cold, hopeful Florida morning.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Once again, headlines are proclaiming the discovery of an "Earth-like" planet orbiting another star.  Once again, closer inspection of the reports indicates that this new-found planet, based on the very little we know about it, is very unlike Earth.  Didn't this just happen a few months <a href="../../2005/06/new_earthlike_p.html">ago</a>?<ul><li>The New York Times:  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/25/science/space/25cnd-planet.html?hp&ex=1138251600&en=e0b4d4ef4a3063e9&ei=5094&partner=homepage">Astronomers Briefly Glimpse an Earthlike Planet</a>  (since changed to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/26/science/26planet.html">Search Finds Far-Off Planet Akin to Earth</a>, which is a slight improvement, I guess)</li><br />
<li>Nature (yes, the prestigious science journal!):  <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060123/full/060123-5.html">Found: one Earth-like planet</a></li><br />
<li>MSNBC:  <a href="https://msnbc.msn.com/id/11013519/">Scientists spot a new Earthlike planet</a></li><br />
<li>Most dramatic of all, ABC Science Online (Australia):  <a href="http://abc.net.au/science/news/space/SpaceRepublish_1554907.htm">Earth's twin found at heart of Milky Way</a></li></ul>This is a shame, since behind the misleading headlines is an interesting <a href="http://bulge.astro.princeton.edu/~ogle/ogle3/blg390.html">discovery</a>.</p>

<p>So what do we really know?</p>

<p>This planet was found via a system of telescopes and instruments, set up over the last fifteen years or so, that monitor millions of stars regularly, looking for variations in their brightness.  The particular system used here is called OGLE, for Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment.  </p>

<p>As predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, massive objects can act as lenses, bending and focusing light that passes near them.  As a result of this gravitational lensing, if a too-dim-to-see object passes in front of a brighter, more distant star, the light of the background star brightens gradually before dimming back to normal, revealing the existence of the otherwise unseen foreground object.  The amount of brightening and how quickly it happens (typically weeks to months) depend on the mass of the foreground object and how close it comes to directly passing in front of the background star.  As a result, astronomers can use their measurements to estimate the mass of the unseen object&#151typically a star.</p>

<p>Stars are small (relatively!) and the galaxy is very large, so these lensing events are not common, necessitating monitoring huge numbers of stars to catch a decent sample of events.</p>

<p><a href="http://bulge.astro.princeton.edu/~ogle/ogle3/blg390.html"><img alt="Ogleplanetdata" title="Ogleplanetdata" src="../../images/ogleplanetdata.png" width="300" height="183" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>It turns out that during one of these events seen last summer, as the background star's light was gradually returning back to normal as the invisible foreground star passed by, a secondary brief blip in brightness occurred.  This anomaly only lasted a few hours, and thus required monitoring from another telescope network, <a href="http://planet.iap.fr/OB05390.news.html">PLANET</a> (Probing Lensing Anomalies Network), specially organized to respond quickly to track brief events.  It is this secondary event that is the evidence for the new planet.  The blip is consistent with a gravitational "micro-lensing" event from an object with a mass roughly five or six times that of Earth.  (That's the actual data in the figure at right.)</p>

<p>From the analysis presented by the team of astronomers, the distance to this stellar system is known to within 30% or so.  It is close to the center of our galaxy, twenty-thousand light-years away.  This is much, much futher away than the vast majority of other extra-solar planets discovered in the last ten years by other techniques.  Those are around stars in our own local neighborhood of the galaxy, within a few tens of light-years.  </p>

<p>If we compare the distance of the typical known extra-solar planet, on the order of 100 light-years, to the distance between downtown San Antonio and Kerrville (60 miles), then the distance of this newly-discovered planet is half-way around the world.  That's a long way off!  </p>

<p>The only reason we can know anything about this planet is due to that freak lensing event as it passed virtually directly between us and a background star.  Since that is not going to happen again for this object, we won't be able to learn anything more about it.  At least not until we invent radically new astronomical instruments and techniques well beyond the capabilities of anything currently imagined.</p>

<p>The information the astronomers can get from this one-time event is extremely limited.  The mass of the planet is only known to within a factor of four&#151;it could be anywhere from 2.5 to 10 times the mass of Earth (and that is just the one-sigma confidence interval, for those familiar with such terms).</p>

<p>If it's on the bottom end of that range, its mass, if nothing else, could be described as "Earth-like."  </p>

<p>But the star it circles is much smaller than our Sun, as revealed by its lensing effect on the background star.  And, based on the delay between the peak of the central star's lensing event and the planet's lensing event, it is much further out from its sun than we are from ours.  If we know anything about this planet, it is that it must be extremely cold.  That should conclusively rule-out any notion that it is like Earth.</p>

<p>And just as easily as the planet could be only a few times Earth's mass, it may be 10 times Earth's mass.  That and its frozen temperature would make it much more Uranus-like than Earth-like.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we're not going to find out anything more.</p>

<p>The benefit of studying lensing events is not learning about individual systems, but getting a relatively unbiased sample of what kinds of objects are out there floating around in the galaxy, occasionally passing in front of background stars.  As yet, lensing events have revealed only three planets, including this new discovery, so any statistical information that can be derived is extremely limited.</p>  

<p>Of course, that's not stopping some people.  Scientists love to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/26/science/26planet.html">speculate</a>.</p>

<blockquote><em>As Dr. Beaulieu explained in an e-mail message, it would have been much easier to see a giant gaseous type of planet. The long odds against detecting so small a planet as the new one argues for its commonness. 

<p>"If only a small fraction of the stars had such planets, we would have never detected this small planet," Dr. Beaulieu said.</p>

<p>Scott Tremaine, a theorist at Princeton, said, "The results suggest that rock-ice planets must be more common than gas giants."</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Eventually, thanks to the more traditional techniques used to find planets in our neighborhood of the galaxy, we'll find a true Earth-like planet.  One close enough to study in much more depth.  I look forward to those headlines, perhaps a decade or so away.</p>

<p>For more, get the straight scoop from the scientists at <a href="http://bulge.astro.princeton.edu/~ogle/">OGLE</a> and <a href="http://planet.iap.fr/">PLANET</a>, or else read Phil Plait's <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2006/01/25/planet-with-5-times-earths-mass-found-25000-light-years-away/">Bad Astronomy Blog</a> for a nice summary.</p>

				<p>A couple weeks ago, the Bush administration unilaterally opened up an area of prime wildlife habitat in northern Alaska, Lake Teshekpuk, for oil leasing&#151;an area that had previously been protected even while the vast majority of surrounding lands had been opened.</p>

<p>Little did I know when I first <a href="../../2006/01/oil_hunger_thir.html">wrote</a> about this, but this event serves as yet another illustration of how the corrupt lobbyist Jack Abramoff and his friends and associates are such an integral part of the GOP power structure that runs the federal government these days.</p>

<p>The beaurocrat who gave the final sign off on the giveaway of Lake Teshekpuk to the oil industry?  Deputy Assistant Interior Secretary Chad Calvert.  His wife?  <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Jennifer_Johnson_Calvert">Jennifer Calvert</a>, co-founder of the lobbying firm Washington Strategies.  Their former boss?  Jack Abramoff.  Her partner at Washington Strategies?  <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=William_P._Jarrell">William P. Jarrell</a>, former top staffer for none other than Tom DeLay.  </p>

<p>Jennifer Calvert has achieved some recent notoriety via Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo.  Seems that back in the year 2000, while working for Abramoff's lobbying firm, her job included acting as a <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/007403.php">liason</a> between politicians and aides looking for special event tickets and Abramoff, who was handing them out like candy.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago, she felt compelled to issue this <a href="http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=52380">statement</a>:<blockquote><em>I certainly do not have any involvement with the illegal acts of Jack Abramoff, and have not been questioned in the wrongdoing surrounding him or his associates. In fact, from what I’ve read, the offenses at the heart of the Abramoff investigation occurred when he was at the Greenberg Traurig firm – well after I ever worked with him at Preston Gates.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>About Chad Calvert, the <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0417,barrett,53013,1.html">Village Voice</a> published an article nearly two years ago that includes a brief passage suggesting that he used his position at the Interior Department to gain access for his wife, and her new lobbying firm, to Wayne Smith, then the assistant deputy secretary in charge of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.<blockquote><em>... Bill Jarrell and Jennifer Calvert, two lobbyists who'd worked with Abramoff prior to 2001, left him within days of the [2000] election to form their own company, Washington Strategies, immediately attracting tribal clients. Jarrell, like Scanlon, was once a top DeLay staffer. Smith says Jennifer's husband, Chad Calvert, while he was Interior's deputy director of legislative affairs, introduced her to him, left documents from her in his office, and joined the two of them at lobbying lunches—recollections the Calverts only partially deny.</em></blockquote>The GOP congressional leadership, Abramoff-connected lobbyists, and flunkies in the Bush administration are all one big happy, ethically challenged, <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2134512/">family</a>.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Over the weekend, the San Antonio Express-News published a revealing <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA012206.01A.Schaefer_Lawsuits.356ac02.html">article</a> about how the governmental system in Texas is rigged vastly in the favor of real-estate developers over the needs and desires of the communities of our state.</p>

<p>In short, no matter what laws a community may pass to attempt to regulate and control how it develops for the benefit of its citizens, real estate developers can do whatever they please.  All thanks to what a legal concept so unobtrusively called "vested rights."</p>

<p>The scenario from Sunday's article is sadly typical, as revealed in a <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA101605.1A.vested.main.3d67547.html">four-part</a> Express-News report from last October.  (1) City wants developer to abide by laws passed roughly a decade ago that require developer to be a good neighbor.  (2) Developer objects to obeying current laws and waves around vague 30-year old documents from a previous owner of the land describing a completely different project, claiming that these ancient forms exempt the developer from current law.  (3) A governmental entity, beaurocrat or judge, approves the developer's objection thanks to the Texas state law concept of "vested rights."    (4) Land development proceeds, making oodles of money for the developer at the expense of the citizens of the community whose laws he has just flouted.  </p>

<p>In the specific case reported on Sunday, the developer is John Schaefer and the city is San Antonio.<blockquote><em>The 27 acres of plowed earth that Schaefer and city lawyers are skirmishing over lies on the rapidly growing Northeast Side. </p>

<p>Bernard said the city asked Schaefer's engineer to prove that plans for the dense, 150-home development on Crestway Road wouldn't dramatically increase storm-water runoff flowing to a dam on Martinez Creek. </p>

<p>But Schaefer felt the property was already designed to handle the runoff and didn't want to follow the city's 1997 drainage ordinance. <br />
The rules require developers to either pay fees earmarked for flood-control projects, or set aside valuable land for basins that impede runoff. </p>

<p>Schaefer said he didn't have to follow those requirements because of a 1971 planning document known as a plat that had been filed by a previous landowner. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The 1971 plat in Schaefer's possession only showed the contours of the property, giving no indication of what was supposed to be built. </p>

<p>Schaefer and his engineer said that didn't matter. </p>

<p>"They've got a plat," said engineer Harry Jewett during a civil deposition. "They can do anything under that, whether it would have been a mobile home park or a subdivision of single-family residences or a skating rink or a shopping mall or whatever."</em></blockquote>The result?<blockquote><em>In the end, [district court Judge Andy] Mireles granted Schaefer nearly every item on his wish list, including exemptions from the city's drainage rules. </p>

<p>The decision meant Schaefer could use his vague plan, and he was also exempted from ordinances covering safety standards for issues such as street construction.</em></blockquote>Until recently, San Antonio bureaucrats appear to have been complicit in this undermining of their own laws.  But that has been changing as more and more citizens become concerned with runaway growth:<blockquote><em>With the hiring of City Attorney Andrew Martin in 2002, San Antonio officials began challenging more grandfathering claims, although most still are approved. The development industry has turned to an old friend, the Texas Legislature, to seek a remedy.</p>

<p>In the past five years, members of the real estate industry who have publicly supported the vested rights law paid more than $4 million in campaign contributions to Texas lawmakers and spent at least $11.7 million in lobbying fees.</p>

<p>During that time, legislators filed several bills that broadened the type of plans that could trigger exemptions.</em></blockquote>So who are the real estate developers' friends in the state capitol that created, and seek to continue, this environment so hostile to local communities?</p>

<p>As those monetary figures above should indicate, there are plenty.  And at the top, the list includes the current Governor of Texas, Rick "Goodhair" Perry himself.  From the Express-News' October <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA101805.01A.VestedPolitics.de2a462.html">investigation</a>:<blockquote><em>When San Antonio's top developers threw a fundraiser last year [2004] for Texas Gov. Rick Perry, architect Steve Heflin [then President of the Greater San Antonio Builders Association] assured colleagues the poolside gala would pay off.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"All of you who participated and contributed — Gov. Perry thanks you for it," Heflin wrote. "Next year when we are campaigning for vested rights legislation, we know we have a friend at our state capitol."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Perry, who received nearly $400,000 in the past five years from the [Texas real estate] industry, has signed three vested rights bills.</p>

<p>The legislation broadened the type of permits that trigger exemptions and whittled down the authority of cities to impose development controls.</em></blockquote>To help get the government of this state out of the hands of special interests, Governor Perry has got to go.</p>

<p>For the main course, the <a href="http://www.greythumb.org/blog/index.php?/archives/65-Tangled-Bank-45.html#extended">latest version</a> of the science carnival <a href="http://www.tangledbank.net">Tangled Bank</a> was published yesterday at <a href="http://www.greythumb.org/blog/">GreyThumb</a>.  There you may find a link to my post on NASA's <a href="../../2006/01/mission_to_plut.html">Pluto mission</a>, which rocketed into the Florida sky this afternoon and is now on the way to the outer regions of our Solar System.  If you read this after 10:00 PM CST, the probe will already be further away from Earth than our Moon.  It'll pick up a boost at Jupiter next year on its way to zipping past Pluto in the summer of 2015.</p>

<p>Also at this week's Tangled Bank, you can find a review, courtesy Orac of <a href="https://oracknows.blogspot.com/">Respectful Insolence</a>, of the <a href="https://oracknows.blogspot.com/2006/01/frontier-science-versus-textbook.html">difference</a> between the bedrock, textbook science that is the foundation of our technological culture, and the cutting-edge, frontier science that dominates the headlines&#151and that is occasionally completely wrong.

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A little at least.  It has been so dry here over the last year, but especially over the last couple months, that the entire countryside feels like a series of devastating fires waiting to happen.  A few hours north of here, they haven't been so lucky, and the devastation started a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p>Hopefully, tonight's brief shower will help postpone those pending fires in our part of Texas beyond the next rain, whenever that may be.  Or else we may get more stories like <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA011606.2B.newsroundup.916ba63.html">this</a> from the San Antonio Express-News today:<blockquote><em><b>Burning leaves ends with burning house</b></p>

<p>A woman learned the seriousness of the statewide burn ban when her house in the 1300 block of West Amber Place caught fire. </p>

<p>The woman was burning leaves in a barrel in her backyard Saturday when other leaves and dry vegetation on the ground also started to burn, District Fire Chief Larry Treviño said. </p>

<p>The back side of the house caught on fire. The blaze jumped to the attic, said Treviño, who estimated the damage at $12,000.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Normally, burning leaves in a barrel would be OK, but because the ground is so dry, it is too dangerous, Treviño said.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>The burn ban that this woman violated to her regret is being advertised on the TransGuide highway signs throughout the city.  The situation is so bad that this week, I noticed the "burn ban" had been elevated into an "arson/burn ban."  </p>

<p>So if you're in Texas, save your arson activities until we have a few good days of showers.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Now, our brief rain is history and the Express-News is reporting that we may not have much rain to look forward to for <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA011706.1A.lanina.da29eb5.html">months</a>.  Yikes.<blockquote><em>A bulletin posted last week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center stated that early stages of a weak La Niña episode are expected to remain in place for three to six months.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"It doesn't happen in a week," [National Weather Service meteorologist Walt] Zaleski said. "For now, it's imperative that Texans and people in the South restrict their water use and take precautions to prevent fires. Conservation will be of utmost importance to get us through the summer months."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"We won't get the spring rain, and that's where we're going to hurt really bad" if La Niña persists, [National Weather Service meteorologist Larry] Eblen said. "The drought's just going to get worse."</em></blockquote></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The Republican-controlled Congress recently was thwarted in its attempt to drill for oil in one of America's most special wildlife refuges, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northern Alaska.  But now, the Bush administration has unilaterally opened up another Alaskan ecological treasure for industrial development.  From the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/environment/la-na-drilling12jan12,0,4945422.story?coll=la-news-environment">Los Angeles Times</a> late last week:<blockquote><em>The Department of Interior on Wednesday approved oil and gas drilling on Alaska land considered such sensitive wildlife habitat that it was first protected by former Interior Secretary James G. Watt under President Reagan, and by four Interior secretaries since.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The plan, signed by Deputy Assistant Interior Secretary Chad Calvert, will open up more than 500,000 acres in and around Teshekpuk Lake on Alaska's oil-rich North Slope.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>What's the big deal, one may say?  This lake is in an area called the "National Petroleum Reserve," a tag that dates from the administration of Warren G. Harding.  That certainly makes it sound like it's not good for anything but oil drilling.  </p>

<p>But that name clearly belies the nature of the land it purports to label.</p>

<p>What is the real Teshekpuk Lake?  A couple weeks ago, the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002716137_arctic02sidebar.html">Seattle Times</a> wrote about it:<blockquote><em>Amid the sprawling sameness of Alaska's tundra is an oval pool of fresh water nine times the size of Lake Washington.</p>

<p>Teshekpuk Lake supports one of the largest bird-nesting sites in North America. Inupiat hunters camp here among the heather and wild poppies to track wolverines or shoot ducks or net eellike burbot and catch whitefish.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"Here we have a huge biologically active area that's precious to us," said Marie Carroll, an Inupiat whose family hunted here for generations. "But all you hear down south is 'Save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>On a clear day this summer, 70 miles from the nearest road, thousands of spindly-legged shorebirds fluttered in from as far as Japan or South America to shed their feathers.</p>

<p>Newborn caribous traipsed along a crooked scratch of creek, feeding on cotton grass.</p>

<p>A black loon slid across a pond that looked like it was stamped into the tundra by giant boot heels.</p>

<p>Life flourishes on this marshy plain, biologists say, because of what's absent: roads, artificial lights, trails — and people.</p>

<p>"It's the beating heart," said George Ahmaogak, an Inupiat whale hunter who just retired as mayor of the North Slope Borough, Northern Alaska's municipal government. "The area is abundant with fish, caribou, brant, white snow geese. It's full of berries. It's one of the last completely undisturbed areas. It's God's country."</em></blockquote>In the late 1990s, thanks to a compromise worked out by President Clinton's Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt, nearly ninety percent of this area of the National Petroleum Reserve was opened up to oil exploration, leaving the area around Teshekpuk Lake protected.  But, based on this latest action, the GOP clearly wants it all.</p>

<p>The administration claims they are attempting to mitigate the impact of industrial development of the populations of nesting migratory birds and caribou.<blockquote><em>But conservation groups blasted the plan and said there were no guarantees the restrictions would remain in place.</p>

<p>"[The Bureau of Land Management is] notorious for granting waivers to their own rules," said Stanley E. Senner, a biologist who is executive director of Audubon Alaska.</p>

<p>"This plan is utterly unbalanced. Even the Reagan administration protected the waterfowl habitat around Teshekpuk Lake because of its world-class ecological and cultural value," Senner said. "No one should be fooled by the window dressing … this plan makes every last acre available for oil development."</p>

<p>Chuck Clusen, director of the Natural Resource Defense Council's Alaska Project, said the BLM "is supposed to balance all values of our public lands. Giving 100% to the oil industry is not what anyone would call balanced."</em></blockquote></p>

<p>What chance does wildlife have in the long run as a neighbor to heavy industry in an isolated corner of the world?<blockquote><em>"Once they start building permanent oil structures, you'll have roads, pipelines — all of which can alter the flow, and the flow of wetlands is complex," [scientist and government consultant Larry] Moulton said.</p>

<p>Moulton is part of a scientific blitzkrieg that has descended on these meadows with biologists trying to study everything from snow geese to caribous before oil rigs arrive. The reason: Much remains unknown about Teshekpuk.</p>

<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has warned that shorebirds return to the same areas each year, so some could be wiped out if breeding sites are disturbed.</p>

<p>State of Alaska scientists have told the BLM that molting geese — featherless and unable to flee — are vulnerable because noise and movement harm their young, and oil development draws foxes and bears, which eat the garbage people leave behind. Scientists have even shown that helicopters so stress Pacific brant that the birds burn more calories.</p>

<p>And "the petroleum reserve is far better than the Arctic Refuge as far as sheer numbers and variety of birds," said Rick Lanctot, a bird expert with the federal fish and wildlife agency. "The diversity and density is just much higher."</em></blockquote>What else will our oil hunger, egged on by our alleged leaders in the Republican-controlled government, destroy before we are done?</p>

				<p>Very soon, NASA will launch a mission to one of the last remaining unexplored regions of our Solar System.  The New Horizons probe will be launched, hopefully next week, on a journey to the planet Pluto and beyond.  No humans will be on board, of course, but that does not cut down on the excitement of the mission.  It is not often that we get to explore new and unknown worlds.</p>

<p>Several media stories claim that the pressing issue is whether Pluto deserves to be labelled a planet.  But it is what it is, whatever we call it.  The real issue is that we know virtually nothing about Pluto and its compatriots at the outskirts of our Solar System.  It is a region called the Kuiper Belt, populated with thousands of objects&#151;of which Pluto was the first discovered and <a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5382004">still</a> one of the largest known.<blockquote><em>What is known about Pluto thus far, said one NASA employee recently, “could basically fit on a postcard”.</em></blockquote>That Pluto had company in its distant environs was only discovered within the last fifteen years.  But now that Earth-bound telescopes have revealed the existence of the mysterious Kuiper Belt objects, this region has become one of the most <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/3581608.html">compelling</a> destinations in the Solar System.<blockquote><em>"Thoughts of Pluto raise images of something very dark, far away and cold. But actually Pluto is a treasure-trove of scientific discovery just waiting to be uncovered," said Andrew Dantzler, director of NASA's solar system division. "A successful mission helps us meet one of our key objectives — understanding the formation and evolution of our solar system."</em></blockquote>Hence, <a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/">New Horizons</a>.  Using a gravity assist from Jupiter, the probe will take nearly a decade to reach Pluto and its satellite (or "sister planet" as some call it) Charon.  It will take a few more years to reach other Kuiper Belt worlds that mission planners hope to study.  And if past robotic exploration missions, such as Voyager, are any guides, many of the <a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/science/scienceOver.html">scientific</a> questions that it will raise are not even known right now.  Lowell Observatory astronomer <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/18/AR2005121800976_2.html">Marc Buie</a> says, "We're going to see things we've never even dreamed of."</p>

<p>At the time New Horizons reaches Pluto, if tens of billions of dollars are spent and all goes smoothly, a twenty-first century version of Neil Armstrong may be getting ready to put a footprint on the Moon again.  But the real exploration will be going on far, far <a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/overview/whyGo.html">away</a>:  "The New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt - the first NASA launch to a "new" planet since Voyager nearly 30 years ago - allows the U.S. to complete the reconnaissance of the solar system."  </p>

<p>By the way, to get to Pluto on that timescale, New Horizons will be <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/18/AR2005121800976.html">launched</a> on "the fastest space trip ever taken," leaving the Moon behind in roughly nine hours.</p>
