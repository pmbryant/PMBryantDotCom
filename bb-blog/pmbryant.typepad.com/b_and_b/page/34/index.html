			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Fellow San Antonian <a href="https://rhetoricrhythm.blogspot.com/2005/06/political-odyssey-pt-1.html">Mike Thomas</a> revealed a little of his political past in a post last week that described his journey from a young Reaganite in 1984 to a&nbsp; liberal, anti-GOP, pro-Democratic Jesse Jackson voter in 1988.&nbsp; He's also promised a second installment where he will reveal more about how &quot;there were two other events that were even more crucial to my transformation - the Iran-Contra scandal and the JFK assassination.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Such stories of how people have reached their current political views have particularly fascinated me in recent years.&nbsp; So now I am tempted to write up my own story soon—at least in part.&nbsp; And I encourage any other bloggers or commenters who happen to read this to follow Mike's example and tell us a little bit about what people or events in your life helped to shape your current politics.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, though, I will simply say that I have not undergone a transformation as dramatic as Mike's.&nbsp; But I was not always the partisan Democrat that I am today.&nbsp; I considered myself an independent for quite a while, and sometimes even considered voting for Republicans or third-party candidates.&nbsp; Once I actually did vote for a Republican in an important race.&nbsp; And another time I came very close, but decided not to vote.</p>

<p>Since I suspect I may never have actually told anyone about that former vote, except for anonymous people on internet discussion forums, I think it would be interesting to turn this into a quiz to any family or friends who may read this (and anyone else as well, of course):&nbsp; Who was that Republican that I voted for?</p>

<p>If anyone cares to guess, I'll update this post later this week with the answer.&nbsp; If not, then the answer shall remain hidden.</p>

UPDATE (6-16, 8:30 AM):  Wow, thanks to my family for playing along with this silly quiz.  It was great to see so many of you posting here for the first time.
<p>
The result is...
<p>
Claire wins!  Beating out Annie with the correct answer:  Bush I in 1988.  That was never a vote I was particularly proud of, but by 1991 it had become an outright embarrassment to me.  
<p>
The other guess were all very good.  Pete Wilson was the one I almost voted for.  If I had voted in the 1990 election for governor of California, I almost certainly would have voted for Pete Wilson over Diane Feinstein.  I decided not to vote, in the end, since I had just moved there and didn't feel confident in my choices.  That turned out to be a very good personal decision, as I saved myself another embarrassing vote.  In 1994, I voted to kick him out.  Not that it did any good.
<p>
As for Jim Thompson, I don't think I was quite old enough to vote for him for Illinois governor in 1986.  Missed it by a few weeks.  I know I didn't vote in that election, and I don't remember who I would have voted for if I had.  But I can see myself possibly having voted for him, so it was a reasonable guess.
<p>
Thanks, and we'll have to try something like this again sometime.

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The headlines are proclaiming: <a id="r-0_0" href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2005-06-14-gliese-planet_x.htm">Earth-like planet discovered orbiting nearby star</a>, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-sci-planet14jun14,1,3960082.story?coll=la-headlines-nation">Distant Object May Be a Planet Similar to Ours</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/13/AR2005061301469.html">'Rocky' Earth-Like Planet Discovered</a>, <a id="r-8_0" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0506140293jun14,1,1982137.story?coll=chi-newsnationworld-hed">Earth-like planet without life discovered outside solar system</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/14/science/space/14plan.html?">Found: Earth's Distant Cousin</a>.</p>

<p>But once you get into the meat of the articles, you find that this planet is not terribly &quot;Earth-like&quot; after all.&nbsp; (Blame the astronomers, not the press, for this one.&nbsp; Their <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-06/uoc--adm061305.php">press release</a> is entitled &quot;Astronomers discover most Earth-like extrasolar planet yet.&quot;)</p>

<p>This new planet is roughly seven and a half times more massive than Earth, which makes it more comparable to the small gas giants Uranus and Neptune, at roughly half of their mass.&nbsp; Also, it orbits a tiny red dwarf star, much dimmer than our own Sun.&nbsp; Finally, it is extremely close to that small star, so that it is still <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/14/science/space/14plan.html?">searing hot</a>.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><em>At such a close distance, the planet could be tidally locked,
keeping the same face toward its star at all times. Dr. Marcy said the
temperature on the side of the planet facing the star would be 400 to
700 degrees, like &quot;chicken roasting temperatures.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>That is too
warm for liquid water or ice, but it could be cold on the backside of
planet, which, as Dr. Marcy said, &quot;faces the darkness of the universe.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>We wouldn't be particularly comfortable if Earth were anything like that.</p>

<p>If the speculation that it is rocky, and not a gas giant, is correct, it would be a bit more accurate to label it a Mercury-like, or perhaps Venus-like, planet.&nbsp; But, as with many of the <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/planets/">extrasolar planets</a> discovered to this point, our solar system has no comparable objects.&nbsp; The current means of detecting planets is geared, of necessity, to finding either very massive ones, like Jupiter and Saturn, or ones extraordinarily close to their parent star.&nbsp; Our system has no planets of the latter type, so one of the big surprises of this research since the mid-1990s is the large number of such planets being found.</p>

<p>Of course, this particular discovery is still fascinating.&nbsp; Its discoverers have every right to brag, since they are pushing current technology to its limits in detecting planets so small.&nbsp; But someday, perhaps within another decade, with new <a href="http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/">space-based instruments</a>, we actually will discover Earth-like planets.&nbsp; So let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=16981">House Appropriations Committee</a> apparently understands better the value of Earth science than does the current top management of NASA (via <a href="http://www.nasawatch.com/archives/2005/06/house_approps_o.html">NASA Watch</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p><em>
The Committee is very concerned about the reductions to NASA's science programs especially the drastic reductions to earth science programs designed to provide a better understanding of our planet. 
</em></p>

<p>
<em>...
</em></p>

<p>
<em>To begin to address this shortcoming the Committee is providing $40,000,000 [to NASA science] above the budget request. Within the funds provided for science, $35,000,000 is included for the Glory mission, an increase of $30,000,000 above the budget request. Without this additional funding, the amount designated in the fiscal year 2006 budget request would clearly have resulted in the unraveling of Glory as an integrated mission and resulted in a certain delay in the launch of key instruments several years beyond the planned launch date. NASA's Glory program is a key Global Climate Change Research Initiative (CCRI) mission and critical to the achievement of CCRI's science goals.
</em></p></blockquote><p>

So Glory is saved, at least for now.

</p>

<p>I'd heard about the extra $40 million earlier, but didn't know exactly where that money would be going.&nbsp; I am very glad to see that most of it is going to Earth science and, in particular, to the Glory mission.</p>

<p>I haven't written specifically about <a href="http://glory.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Glory</a> yet, except for a brief mention in my op-ed for the <a href="http://dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/09//opinion/op-ed/9oped09bryant.txt">Washington Examiner</a>, but one of its primary goals is to study the behavior of aerosols in Earth's atmosphere.&nbsp; The properties of these tiny particles are a major uncertainty in current climate models.&nbsp; So un-cancelling Glory will be a major boon to research into the effects of global warming.

</p>

<p>That still leaves <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">Global Precipitation Measurement</a> delayed, and at least three <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_gifts_mis.html">other</a> <a href="../../2005/06/ocean_vector_wi.html">missions</a> cancelled.&nbsp; But any good news on this front is quite welcome.

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Young progressive blogger <a title="Ezra Klein: Repeal McCain-Feingold!" href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/repeal_mccainfe.html">Ezra Klein</a> has echoed an appeal by economics professor <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/06/time_to_repeal.html#more">James Hamilton</a> to repeal the McCain-Feingold campaign reform act.&nbsp; The McCain-Feingold law, officially known as the <a href="http://www.citizen.org/congress/campaign/legislation/bcralaw/index.cfm">Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002</a>, did two things:&nbsp; (1) eliminate the old, unregulated &quot;soft money&quot; contributions to political parties, and (2) place stricter regulations on campaign ads in the period immediately preceding elections.</p>

<p>Both Klein and Hamilton dislike the new system of independent groups (called &quot;527 organizations&quot;) that has sprung up, largely in response to the ban on soft money.&nbsp; Hamilton further dislikes what he thinks are free speech restrictions as a result of the tighter regulation of campaign ads.</p>

<p>Campaign finance reform has been a very complicated issue, and I can't claim to fully understand all the details of the current system (or even the pre-2002 system).&nbsp; But I think the fundamental principles of the McCain-Feingold law are sound, so what deficiencies arise can be fixed by tweaking the law, rather than simply throwing it out.</p>

<p>Klein writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>I'd much rather have parties absorbing unlimited contributions than
watch the funding get sucked up by unaccountable, unknowable 527's. 
Parties and campaigns can, at the least, be held accountable.&nbsp; 527's,
on the other hand, are just hatchet men, called in for the dirty work
and disavowed for the cameras.</em></p></blockquote><p>But independent &quot;hatchet men&quot; existed long before McCain-Feingold became law.&nbsp; Repealing the act would do nothing to eliminate them.&nbsp; Requiring disclosure of their funding sources, however, would help solve the &quot;unaccountable, unknowable&quot; problem.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I do oppose efforts to impose soft money restrictions on independent groups like 527 organizations, as <a href="http://www.reason.com/rauch/050905.shtml">some Senators</a> have proposed.&nbsp; Restricting donatons to independent groups of citizens violates the fundamental principles of our government.</p>

<p>How to treat the regulations on campaign ads that Hamilton dislikes is a much more complicated issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;I've never been entirely comfortable with that aspect of McCain-Feingold.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I think Hamilton's criticism is overblown.</p><blockquote><p><em> So what exactly now defines prohibited participation in an election?&nbsp; When Congressman David 
Dreier (R-CA) ran into a withering hail of criticism last October for his position on 
immigration from co-hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou at Los Angeles <a href="http://www.kfi640.com/main.html"> radio station KFI</a>, the National Republican 
Congressional Committee <a href="http://www.kfi640.com/timages/page/media/JNKFEC.pdf"> filed a 
complaint</a>
with the Federal Election Commission, arguing that, since the radio
station on which the views were expressed was owned by a corporation,
these broadcasts represented an illegal corporate contribution to the
campaign of Dreier's opponent, Democrat Cynthia Matthews. The NRCC
complaint further argued that, under McCain-Feingold, the radio hosts
could personally be criminally prosecuted for felonies for assisting in
Matthews' campaign in this way, specifically mentioning a 5-year jail
term. To be sure, the radio hosts had been vitriolic in their attacks
on Dreier, and described their agenda openly as a &quot;fire Dreier&quot;
campaign. But is it really a felony in America today to say loudly and
repeatedly that a certain elected official needs to be dumped?&nbsp; </em></p></blockquote><p>To answer his question:&nbsp; apparently not, since I presume the radio hosts and owner are not being prosecuted for this.&nbsp; The NRCC, in typical Republican fashion, is always going to try to intimidate its critics prior to an election.&nbsp; If McCain-Feingold were repealed, they would simply find another law to use, and there are plenty of earlier campaign regulations they can point to.</p>

<p>So while McCain-Feingold obviously is not perfect and leaves a lot to be desired, a strong case for repealing it has yet to be made.</p>

<p>The ultimate, simple, solution to campaign financing, which Ezra Klein alludes to in his post, remains requiring television and radio stations that broadcast over the public airwaves to donate air time to candidates in the weeks preceding elections.&nbsp; One of the most expensive line items in campaigns is thus eliminated.&nbsp; And candidates of unequal funding enter the playing field at a much more equal level.&nbsp; Of course, given the huge windfall that broadcast stations make from political ads, they are not going to like this idea at all.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The late-April <a href="http://www.nap.edu/books/0309096723/html">National Research Council report</a> on the state of NASA's Earth science program mentioned six important missions that were in dire budget straits due to NASA's <a href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/08/opinion/op-ed/9oped09bryant.txt">misplaced emphasis</a> on sending humans back to the dead Moon rather than learn more about our own changing planet. Earlier I've covered <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">Global Precipitation Measurement</a>, which aims to measure rainfall over the bulk of the planet, and the <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_gifts_mis.html">GIFTS mission</a>, which would demonstrate new technology for more detailed and more accurate measurements of atmospheric temperature and water vapor.&nbsp; Despite their great potential for directly benefitting our lives through improved weather forecasting, climate prediction, and more, the former has been delayed until 2010, while the latter has been cancelled.</p>

<p>Another cancelled mission is called &quot;Ocean Vector Winds.&quot;&nbsp; Its goal is simple:&nbsp; to measure the speed and direction of winds over the ocean surface.&nbsp; What does this data buy us?&nbsp; Apparently, quite a lot:&nbsp; improved weather forecasts and storm warnings; improved knowledge of air-sea interactions and ocean circulation and thus improved climate models; and the possibility of more accurate El Nino forecasts.&nbsp; El Nino, as many know, is the phenomenon, driven by changes in air and ocean circulation in the equatorial Pacific, that leads to drastic disruptions of normal climate patterns every few years, with corresponding drastic disruptions to the lives of many millions of people.<br /> </p>

<p>As the NRC panel indicates, the combination of all these benefits would also allow for better management of global agriculture, water resources, and more.&nbsp; This is one of many areas of Earth science where improving our overall knowledge will have wide-ranging benefits to great numbers of people all over the world.</p>

<p>Ocean surface winds can be measured from the ground, can't they?&nbsp; Does this really require a satellite?&nbsp; Indeed, <a href="http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/">buoys</a> and ships can be, and have been, used to provide similar measurements.&nbsp; But they cannot cover nearly enough territory to provide a global map of ocean winds.&nbsp; The data they provide is helpful, but not nearly comprehensive enough to offer the same knowledge and benefits as data from a satellite that can scan all the world's oceans in a short amount of time.<br />
<a href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/index.cfm"><img width="200" height="128" border="0" src="../../images/seawindsquikscatlogo.gif" title="Seawindsquikscatlogo" alt="Seawindsquikscatlogo" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a><br />
Aren't there satellites that are already gathering this data for us?&nbsp; Yes, there is currently one such satellite, a NASA satellite called <a href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/index.cfm">QuikSCAT</a> that carries a scatterometer instrument called SeaWinds.&nbsp; QuickSCAT was launched in 1999 as a quick replacement for <a href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/nscat/index.cfm">NSCAT</a>, which had prematurely failed a couple years earlier after a short, but successful, mission.</p>

<p>QuikSCAT has continued NSCAT's successes, while avoiding its premature death. A forecaster from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction's Tropical Prediction Center is quoted in the NRC report saying that &quot;without QuikSCAT they would be forecasting in the dark.&quot;&nbsp; QuikSCAT not only hasn't failed, but is now three years beyond its designed lifetime.&nbsp; Since it won't last forever, what comes next?</p>

<p>Its first followup, <a href="http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/seawinds/index.cfm">SeaWinds on ADEOS-II</a>, followed the unfortunate path of NSCAT and failed in 2003 after only a few months of operation.&nbsp; And now the other followup, Ocean Vector Winds, originally scheduled for launch in 2008, has been cancelled by NASA.</p>

<p>(Orbiting American scatterometers appear to frequently fall victim to <a href="http://nsidc.org/data/docs/daac/scatterometer_instrument.gd.html">power failures</a> on the satellites that carried them.&nbsp; The original NASA scatterometer was launched on NASA's Seasat mission in 1978.&nbsp; Less than 100 days after launch, &quot;a power failure terminated the mission.&quot; NASA didn't send another scatterometer into space until NSCAT in 1996.&nbsp; Barely nine months into its mission aboard the Japanese spacecraft ADEOS-I, &quot;a power failure terminated the mission.&quot;&nbsp; Then in 2003, a SeaWinds scatterometer was launched on ADEOS-II.&nbsp; You guessed it:&nbsp; six months later, &quot;a power failure terminated the mission.&quot;&nbsp; Only QuickSCAT, the one mission thrown together in a hurry, has escaped this curse of the power failure.)</p>

<p>So what is a scatterometer anyway?&nbsp; A scatterometer bounces microwaves off the ocean surface at an angle and measures how much of this radiation gets scattered back to its detectors.&nbsp; The size of this &quot;backscatter&quot; signal is a measure of the roughness of the ocean surface on the scale of the wavelength of the radiation—in the case of these instruments, a few centimeters.</p>

<p>How does this give us the wind speed and direction at the ocean surface?&nbsp; As the air moves across the ocean, it generates waves, typically with wavelengths on the order of centimeters—generating exactly the roughness on the ocean surface that will cause the radar backscatter that is measured by the scatterometer.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://manati.orbit.nesdis.noaa.gov/quikscat/"><img width="200" height="150" border="0" src="../../images/quikscat0613.png" title="Quikscat0613" alt="QuikSCAT data" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>Via the method described above, QuikSCAT can measure wind speeds from 7 to 45 miles per hour, with an accuracy of around 4 miles per hour.&nbsp; By bouncing microwaves off the ocean at different angles as the satellite orbits overhead, the direction the waves are facing, and hence the wind direction, can also be derived, to an accuracy of around 20 degrees.&nbsp; According to a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/303/5660/978?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=Chelton&amp;searchid=1118636652548_6225&amp;stored_search=&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0">2004 article</a> in Science magazine, this accuracy in speed and direction is comparable to the accuracy of buoy measurements.&nbsp; Unlike buoys, though, the QuikSCAT data is averaged over regions 16 miles across.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://cioss.coas.oregonstate.edu/CIOSS/workshops/miami_meeting/Agenda.html">complications</a>, of course.&nbsp; Rain, in particular, can contaminate the backscatter measurements, by scattering plenty of microwave radiation itself and also by roughening the ocean surface independent of any wind.&nbsp; Land also spoils the data, so ocean winds within 16 miles of land cannot be reliably measured by QuikSCAT.</p>

<p>Looking forward to when QuikSCAT finally dies of old age, the European Space Agency plans to launch its own scatterometer, <a href="http://www.esa.int/esaME/ascat.html">ASCAT</a>, on its first polar-orbiting environmental satellite later this year.&nbsp; ASCAT will only have about half the coverage of QuickSCAT, however, and the NRC notes that the large gap between its measurement swaths will make it difficult to use to improve weather forecasts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, NASA, NOAA, and the Department of Defense teamed up to launch <a href="http://www.ipo.noaa.gov/Projects/windsat.html">Windsat</a> in 2003.&nbsp; Windsat aims to measure ocean winds, but with a radiometer rather than a scatterometer.&nbsp; In other words, by measuring microwave emissions coming up through the atmosphere rather than by bouncing microwaves off the ocean surface.&nbsp; This is a new method, and a test case for a <a href="http://www.npoess.noaa.gov/Technology/cmis_summary.html">future instrument</a> to be incorporated into the <a href="http://www.ipo.noaa.gov/">next generation of polar-orbiting weather satellites</a>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, according to the NRC report, &quot;Preliminary analysis suggests that such passive systems will produce wind observations with less accuracy and with more contamination by rain and land than active scatterometers.&quot;</p>

<p>So, with the cancellation of the Ocean Vector Winds mission, is QuikSCAT the end of the road for American scatterometers?&nbsp; Will we have to be content with a reduced capability for measuring ocean surface winds?&nbsp; It sounds so esoteric when I put it that way.&nbsp; Instead, perhaps I should borrow words from the NRC report and ask if will we will be content to allow a situation that &quot;would worsen El Nino and hurricane forecasts and weather forecasts in coastal areas?&quot;</p>

<p>We have a great tool available for learning more about the planet we live on.&nbsp; A tool that we've already spent many years perfecting.&nbsp; A tool with no comparable replacement.&nbsp; Why abandon it now?</p>

				<p>In the wake of the statement by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/politics/08nasa.html">American Geophysical Union</a> this week, the perilous state of NASA's Earth science program has been much more in the news than it had been since the release of the critical National Research Council report and the House science committee hearing at the end of April (see <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">this earlier post</a> of mine for background information).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Today, the Denver Post has an op-ed about the state of NASA's Earth science programs by <a href="http://denverpost.com/opinion/ci_2793425">James C. Wilson</a>, a professor of engineering at the University of Denver, who leads a group that builds instruments for atmospheric research.&nbsp; As I have also tried to do over the last month, Wilson points out the importance of these programs that NASA is cutting.&nbsp; But one sentence he adds gives the impression that the situation is even more critical than I imagined:</p><blockquote><p><em><span id="default">Fiscal year 2005 Earth science research funds are
now six months late, and many university research groups supported by
NASA science funds are collapsing.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Current year funds are six months late?&nbsp; This is the first I've seen this mentioned, though of course, it is quite possible that I've overlooked something.&nbsp; Is this a general problem, or restricted to certain groups, with Wilson's presumably being one of them?<br /><em></em></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A few weeks ago, I discovered Jeff Foust's informative "<a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/">Space Politics</a>" blog, and have been reading it ever since, in trying to keep abreast of all the changes going on at NASA these days.  So I was pleasantly surprised to see that he commented on my <a href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/08/opinion/op-ed/9oped09bryant.txt">op-ed</a> in the Washington Examiner today, as well as the other piece mine was paired with, by <a href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/08/opinion/op-ed/8oped09schulze.txt">Charles Schultze</a>, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institute.  Foust had some mild <a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/archives/000560.html">criticism</a> for both of us.<blockquote><em>While both make some good points, particularly about concerns that science programs at NASA are getting squeezed in the short term (something House appropriators agree with to some degree, having added $40 million for them in the FY06 budget), I am personally disappointed with the logic of both essays. Both try to establish a dichotomy: in one [Schultze's], you can either save money to restore Medicare and Social Security, or you can fling people across the solar system; in the other [mine], you can either study the Earth to save us from natural disasters, or you can fling people across the solar system. Both, I think, are false dichotomies: Medicare and Social Security require fundamental structural changes that cannot be solved even if you disbanded NASA (good robotic science missions and all) and dispersed its budget to those programs. Climate change and other earth sciences studies are serious issues that require roles for multiple government actors, not just NASA. Rather than constructing simplistic either-or decision sets, let's see if there's a way to do both—and take advantage of what benefits of exploration we can reap in the process.</em></blockquote>I agree that, in principle, choosing between studying Earth and flying people to the Moon and Mars is a false dichotomy.  But in the real world of NASA today, it is a very real dichotomy.  NASA has one pot of money.  Bush and Congress have not given NASA any significant amount of extra funding, while saddling the space agency with the huge new mandate of sending astronauts back to the Moon in the next ten years.</p>

<p>The result is clear.  NASA is siphoning money off of its tremendously productive science programs&#151aeronautics research, space science, and Earth science are all getting big hits.  And by my article, I hope to issue a reminder that, despite their low public profile, NASA's Earth science missions are extremely important to all of us who live on this planet.  They should not be sacrificed for a goal with many fewer benefits to society.  </p>

<p>If the public clamor is loud enough, perhaps Congress will provide NASA with extra funds&#151in order to satisfy my so-called "Vision for Understanding Earth" while also still satisfying Bush's "Vision for Space Exploration."  Alternatively, if necessary (and it probably is, given Bush's huge budget deficits), Congress could override the President's priorities and fully fund NASA's Earth science programs at the expense of the manned space program.  Or at least fund it well enough to keep it alive for the long-term.</p>

<p>If so, returning to the Moon may have to wait a while longer.  Given the urgency of dealing with the changing life support systems of our planet, I think the wait will be very worthwhile.</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://dcexaminer.com/">Washington Examiner</a> has published an op-ed, entitled &quot;<a href="http://dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/09//opinion/op-ed/9oped09bryant.txt">A Vision for understanding Earth</a>&quot;, about the endangered NASA Earth science program by a fellow who is probably familiar to the handful of readers of this blog.&nbsp; At least I certainly hope so, since that fellow is actually the author of this blog.&nbsp; This is my first published op-ed, and I owe thanks to Sean-Paul Kelley of <a href="http://agonist.org/">The Agonist</a> for helping make this possible, and also for sending me the link late last night when it showed up online.&nbsp; (And also for linking to the op-ed from his <a href="http://agonist.org/story/2005/6/8/194637/8075">blog</a>, as well.)</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/politics/08nasa.html">New York Times</a> has an article on the same subject today.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.agu.org/">American Geophysical Union</a>, a group representing thousands of scientists, has issued a warning about the <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">precarious state</a> of NASA Earth science.&nbsp; From the Times article:</p><blockquote><p><em>The president of the group, Dr. John A. Orcutt of the Scripps
Institute of Oceanography in San Diego, told a news conference that
NASA was being asked to do too much with the money it was given. </em></p>

<p><em>Cutting
back on Earth science, Dr. Orcutt said, endangers significant progress
that has been made in understanding the environment over the last few
decades and hampers innovative research.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Missions being
eliminated or subject to long delays include inexpensive Explorer-class
satellites for space science and Pathfinder missions for Earth science,
which are innovative next steps in what we need to study,&quot; he said
later. &quot;When you look to the future, there's not much in the pipeline
to replace many of the satellites operating now when they reach the end
of their lives.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>In testimony before Congress, NASA officials had
acknowledged the drop in science budgets, but said it was a temporary
situation that would be corrected.</em></p>

<p><em>Dr. Eric J. Barron of
Pennsylvania State University, a member of the committee that drafted
the statement, said a pause was significant because it left little to
encourage young scientists and engineers to go into Earth and space
science and threatened to create a gap in future knowledge. </em></p>

<p><em>&quot;You need to have a lot of faith in it being 'temporary,' &quot; Dr. Barron said.</em></p></blockquote><p>Since Bush's budget deficits and far from temporary and the new Moon/Mars &quot;<a href="../../2005/05/bushs_nasa.html">Vision for Space Exploration</a>&quot; is also far from temporary, I see no reason to believe the NASA officials who claim this is merely a temporary bump in the road.&nbsp; If so, it will only be because enough of us raise a big enough stink that Congress decides to reverse NASA's and Bush's extremely shortsighted decision-making.</p>

<p>Despite Bush's shifting of priorities away from learning about our own planet, President Bush still had the nerve to say <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/e80e1fbc-d7bb-11d9-9f43-00000e2511c8.html">yesterday</a> that &quot;We need to know more about [global warming].&nbsp; It's a lot easier to solve when you know more about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Contrary to his words, Bush' policies are making sure that we will not know enough about global warming to solve it until it is too late.</p>

<p>At that point, the other member of this household finally let it slip that she indeed had a strong preference in this race, despite earlier professions to the contrary.&nbsp; Upon hearing of Hardberger's victory from me, a quiet, but distinct and forceful &quot;Yes!&quot; could clearly be heard.&nbsp; Apparently the experience factor was decisive for her.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2005/06/conservation_ea.html">Conservation easements:  time for reform?</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Due to the constantly rising price of real estate and the rapid speed of development in rural areas all over the country, conservations easements, rather than outright land purchases, are increasingly being used by environmental organizations and governments to preserve open space.&nbsp; Certainly conservation easements are used very frequently here in the <a href="../../2005/05/san_antonio_pro.html">San
Antonio area</a> to help preserve undeveloped land over the Edwards aquifer
recharge zone.</p>

<p>Landowners sell or donate the development rights to their property to land trusts dedicated to overseeing the land, such as <a href="http://nature.org/">The Nature Conservancy</a>.&nbsp; In exchange, the landowner not only gets the satisfaction of saving their land from eventually being paved over, but also gets a healthy tax deduction.</p>

<p>But this system of preserving land is far from ideal.&nbsp; John Echeverria of the Georgetown Environmental Law and Policy Institute has a concise summary of its &quot;<a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/gelpi/papers/topten.pdf">top ten</a>&quot; shortcomings, including these:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>1. Paying to stop unwise land use is </em>expensive<em>; paying for easements through the tax system makes the fiscal burden less visible, but it does not eliminate it.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>3. A voluntary approach does not address the central problem in environmental law, the </em>hold-out problem<em>; it creates the risk that a few irresponsible land owners will undermine efforts to achieve conservation goals at the landscape, watershed, or ecosystem level.</em></p>

<p><em>4. Voluntary conservation easements are likely to be </em>relatively ineffective<em>; those most likely to donate or sell easements voluntarily are likely to have little or no intention of changing land uses; those most likely to change land uses in the near future will be least likely to volunteer.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>10. The idea that landowners should conserve only when the taxpayer pays them conflicts with what Aldo Leopold called the imperative of developing an American “</em>land ethic<em>.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Echeverria's shortcoming number 7 points out that the current system of conservation easements, due to the difficulty of appraisal, the unique nature of each agreement, and the lack of public regulation of land trusts, the current system is ripe for abuse.</p>

<p>As a result of this occasional abuse, Congress is holding an <a href="http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20050606/NEWS/106060007">inquiry</a> into reforming the system:</p><blockquote><p><em>The U.S. Senate Finance Committee will put land
conservation tax laws under the microscope starting Wednesday. In the
worst-case scenario, it could eliminate a compelling incentive that
some ranchers, farmers and other landowners have to preserve their open
space rather than sell it to developers.</em></p>
<p><em>Critics of current tax
deduction regulations contend that the federal government is losing
millions of dollars due to questionable or downright dishonest
conservation efforts - like developers claiming deductions for
preserving some of their land as a golf course and reducing the number
of houses they build.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.hcn.org/servlets/hcn.Article?article_id=15533">High Country News</a> has an excellent series of articles on this subject, as it relates to the current pace of rapid development in the rural American west, in their current issue (available by subscription only unfortunately).&nbsp; These articles illustrate the potential for abuse, but also show that the vast majority of conservation easements are valid and worthwhile.</p><blockquote><p><em><p>
The basic easement documents, describing which activities are allowed
on each piece of land and which are not, are tucked away in the files
of the landowners, land trusts, county recorders’ offices, and many
other government offices. </p>

<p>
County and state agencies in Montana have computerized records and
mapping, but no one has a complete list or map of all the Montana
easements. The state’s Natural Resource Information System makes an
effort to collect easement information from other government offices
and land trusts. But the land trusts report only voluntarily, and the
government records are so scattered, &quot;My guess is that we probably have
90 to 95 percent of the (easement) acres, and maybe 75 percent of the
number of easements,&quot; says Allan Cox, who runs the agency’s mapping
program.
</p>

<p>The same goes in other states. And nationwide, the periodic
surveys of land trusts by the Land Trust Alliance, a Washington,
D.C.-based umbrella group, are similarly incomplete. The Alliance
totals only the acres that the trusts choose to report, and hundreds of
trusts don’t even respond to its surveys. The federal government
doesn’t know how many acres of easements its agencies oversee, either.
</p>

<p>
And the tax breaks are known only by the landowners, their accountants, the IRS, and sometimes, state revenue departments.
</p>

<p>The lack of public information, and of strict rules in the
system, has created an opportunity for abuse and led to calls for
reform. &quot;I’ve traveled around the country, meeting with land trust
people in almost every state, and they are good people who want to do
the right thing,&quot; says Small, a lawyer who now works on easement deals
around the country. &quot;Ninety-five percent of what’s been done (with
conservation easements) has been from excellent to good, or medium
good. Maybe 5 percent has been bad.&quot;</p></em></p></blockquote><p>Besides occasional abuse, one problem with the current system is that it is very beneficial to wealthy landowners, but, in most places, of little benefit to land-rich, cash-poor ranchers and farmers.&nbsp; The latter do not have enough income to take advantage of the full tax deductions.</p>

<p>Colorado has addressed this problem by giving state tax credits that can then be sold.&nbsp; With this program, a rancher can donate a conservation easement, preserving his or her land, and then sell the tax credits to a wealthy buyer.&nbsp; This wealthy buyer can then apply the credits to his or her tax bill.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.hcn.org/servlets/hcn.Article?article_id=15548">High Country News</a>, the buyer typically pays 90 cents for every dollar of tax credit.&nbsp; After middlemen take out some more money, the rancher typically ends up with 80 cents for every dollar of the original credit.</p>

<p>If Congress decides to reform the current federal system, hopefully they will use the opportunity to adopt a program with a similar goal—spreading the benefits of conservation easements beyond just those with the income to take advantage of the huge tax deductions.&nbsp; With the GOP running things, however, this is a longshot.&nbsp; </p>

<p>What is truly sad, though, is that a comprehensive program of land conservation addressing all, or even a few, of Echeverria's concerns is entirely out of the question in the current political landscape.&nbsp; How can we change that?</p>
