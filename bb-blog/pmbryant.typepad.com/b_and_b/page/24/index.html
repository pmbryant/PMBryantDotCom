					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2006/02/nasa_sciences_f.html">NASA science's future clouded by Bush vision</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Another year, another Bush NASA budget that fails to adequately fund the agency that is supposed to fulfill his so-called "Vision for Space Exploration."  Unfortunately, this was <a href="../../2005/05/bushs_nasa.html">predictable</a> right from the moment when Bush first proposed that NASA set its sight on returning humans to the Moon.  That is why I suspect that the actual Bush vision is more along the lines of a Vision for Gradually Purging NASA of its Troublesome Scientists&#151;particularly those ones who study the planet we live on.  The recent actions of Bush flunky <a href="../../2006/02/nasa_humiliated.html">George Deutsch</a> to harass those same scientists is certainly consistent with this hypothesis.  (By the way, Deutsch has apparently <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/politics/08nasa.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">resigned</a> from NASA.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/DN-nasabudget_07tex.ART.State.Edition2.212112d.html">headlines</a> claim that NASA's budget has increased by a few percent, thus keeping up with inflation.  But hidden below the surface is the news that the <a href="../../2005/07/the_space_relic.html">lame duck</a> Space Shuttle program and the initial preparations for the thinly-justified, relatively <a href="../../2005/12/so_why_are_we_g.html">uninspiring</a> goal of sending humans back to the Moon eat up all of that small increase and more.  The actual science that NASA does&#151;in particular the missions that gather data on how the Earth works and how it is changing&#151;will likely have to be severely cut in coming years if Bush gets his way.  </p>

<p>Keith Cowing of <a href="http://www.nasawatch.com/archives/2006/02/the_slow_motion.html">NASA Watch</a> calls it "the slow motion gutting of space science."  Likely the same will be said of Earth science once the full details emerge.</p>

<p>The Chair of the House Science Committee, <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18943">Sherwood Boehlert</a> of New York, who <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">last year</a> led the charge to temporarily preserve NASA's Earth science programs, says this about the Bush administration's NASA budget proposal:<blockquote><em>I am also greatly concerned about the proposed budget for [NASA], and particularly the slowed growth for NASA's space and earth science programs. We will be reviewing that budget closely to determine exactly what impact the sharply reduced growth for NASA science will have. Science missions have been NASA's most successful activities, and they are also the activities at NASA that most enhance human understanding of our world (the true meaning of 'exploration') and that have the greatest potential to develop new technologies. Science funding should not be taking a back seat to operational programs that have much less impact. We have to be sure that we are not demonstrating that science is a 'crown jewel' of NASA by seeing how much we can get for it at the pawnshop.</em></blockquote>NASA Administrator Mike Griffin has been repeatedly saying in recent <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/2006-02-06-nasa-budget_x.htm?POE=TECISVA">months</a>, "NASA simply cannot afford to do everything that our many constituencies would like us to do."  In spite of this common refrain, Griffin has <a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/archives/000809.html">previously</a> claimed that science would not be cut.  </p>

<p>But what is clear now, if only suspected before, is that NASA science is going to get the short end of the stick.  If Congress allows that to happen, it will be a travesty.  For, as Rep. Boehlert says, science missions have been NASA's most successful activities.  And the unheralded Earth science programs are NASA's most valuable activities.  </p>

<p>At least they are the most valuable for those of us who have to live on this planet.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>On the heels of his <a href="../../2006/01/scientists_and_.html">dubious</a> advice for scientists to get involved in targeting individual politicians for defeat, journalist Chris Mooney now, in a new <a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/01/learning_to_speak_science.php">article</a> in Seed magazine, has further suggestions for how scientists can combat the distortion of their work by those with ulterior motives.</p>

<p>The questions he is trying to answer: &quot;How can scientists combat the political distortion of science? How can they defend evolution? How can they win back America, and better translate what they know for the public?&quot;</p>

<p>Aside from the &quot;win back America&quot; one (scientists have not lost America, after all), these are reasonable questions. Political distortion of science has become epidemic amongst the ruling party in Washington, DC. Evolution has been under attack by religious conservatives for decades. And scientists have traditionally been poor at translating their knowledge to the public.</p>

<p>Mooney's approach: &quot;Ideally, and in the best spirit of science, we should view the current political quandary as a problem to be addressed through trial and error—empirical attempts to determine what actually works when it comes to translating science for the general public.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, his suggestion:</p><blockquote><p><em>Ironically, followers of regular politics are catching on to something that doesn’t seem to have dawned on most scientists yet: It’s actually possible to study empirically which public communication messages work and which don’t. It’s even becoming possible to craft a communications strategy that’s based on a rich understanding of how the human mind actually operates—one that, if properly executed by scientists and their supporters, could help rescue scientific integrity in America while better informing the American public. If we want to defend the knowledge that science has brought into the world, perhaps we should consider drawing upon the talents of researchers—social and cognitive scientists—who have brought empirical methods to bear on the study of effective political communication itself.</em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Yes, good ol' &quot;framing&quot;—an approach that the GOP has used as part of their political success over the last decade (e.g., &quot;death tax&quot; rather than &quot;estate tax&quot;), and that many of their opposition suddenly became enchanted with (including myself, if only briefly) after the heart-breaking loss of the most recent Presidential election. </p>

<p>Mooney goes on to provide an example of how framing can be used in the name of science:</p><blockquote><p><em>Consider the technically complex issue of climate change, where attacks on science have been rampant and the public has been deeply confused. Grady and Aubrun [of the communications consulting firm Cultural Logic] have found that as an explanation, the “greenhouse effect” simply confuses people. Few Americans have any firsthand experience of greenhouses, and they don’t grasp the proposed analogy between carbon dioxide (a gas) and glass walls. So instead, Grady and Aubrun suggest talking about a “carbon dioxide blanket” encircling the earth—an explanation that instantly helps people understand why a heating effect is taking place. Sure, it’s a metaphor and shouldn’t be taken literally. But then, so was the concept of an ozone “hole”—a phrasing that instantly allowed the public to understand the issue of ozone depletion and that helped to galvanize political action.</em></p></blockquote><p>I must admit to letting out a big groan when I read the &quot;carbon dioxide blanket&quot; suggestion. As a former scientist with a keen interest in communicating the wonders of scientific discovery to the general population, this strikes me as a move in exactly the wrong direction. Explaining global warming as being caused by a &quot;carbon dioxide blanket,&quot; even if it were accurate, will not do anything to counter the misinformation about scientists supposedly still arguing over whether humans add to global warming and by how much and whether it is harmful. In general, use of frames like this, as Mark Paris put it in a comment at Mooney's <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2006/02/being_constructive.php#more">blog</a>, &quot;might give people the illusion that they understand the problem rather than any real understanding.&quot;</p>

<p></p>

<p>These kind of slick PR tactics are best kept far away from the presentation of scientific results to the public, I believe, lest the public's understanding of science erode further and the public's trust of scientists eventually dwindle towards the level of that of advertisers and politicians.</p>

<p>Mooney does have a better suggestion, regarding fending off the attempts by religious conservatives to insert religious belief into public school science classes. Rather than boycotting hearings led by anti-evolutionists, as scientists recently did in Kansas, they should engage the public. &quot;[T]he scientific community should be promoting a positive message that teaches the public why evolution is such a powerful scientific theory, and about how scientists weigh evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, this applies much broader than evolution. And also, it is hardly a new suggestion. But reminders are always helpful.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The Bush administration is severely cutting the budget of our <a href="../../2005/11/drug_cartels_in.html">already-hurting</a> National Parks Service.  <a href="http://nationalparkstraveler.typepad.com/national_parks_traveler/2006/02/president_bushs.html#more">National Parks Traveler</a> Kurt Repanshek has the details:<blockquote><em>The budget request does indeed reflect a $23.4 million increase in the Park Service's </em>operations<em> budget [as a press release from the head of the park service claims], which would go from nearly $1.72 billion to slightly more than $1.74 billion if President Bush's proposal is adopted by Congress. (Oh, and by the way, this line item calls for a cut of 139 full-time Park Service employees...)    </p>

<p>    However, the operations budget is just one component of the agency's overall appropriation, and Park Service officials acknowledge that the proposed increase would basically keep their operations budget flat.</p>

<p>    Other components range from the United States Park Police and the National Recreation and Preservation budget to Construction and Major Maintenance and Land Acquisition. Factor in all those components and there is indeed a $100 million drop in proposed 2007 funding from the current appropriation, according to the Park Service's own documentation.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Remember this promise Bush made to the American people, back when he was first running for our nation's top job in the fall of 2000?<blockquote><em>Bush picked a roaring Washington state river as the backdrop to discuss his $4.9 billion plan to improve national parks. He accused the Clinton administration of spending too many federal dollars acquiring land and not enough keeping up existing properties, leaving the National Park Service with more property but fewer resources to take care of it.</p>

<p>"The Clinton-Gore administration has chosen to expand the public ownership of land instead of tending to our parks," he said. "Their failure to make maintenance a priority has left our parks at risk and at the breaking point." </p>

<p>Bush would use the money to better maintain park roads, campgrounds and landmarks.</em></blockquote>He has clearly failed this promise.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2006/02/texas_textbook_.html">Texas textbook wars</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Many science bloggers, led by famous radical militant biologist P.Z. Myers of <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a>, have been vigilant in keeping a close eye on the movement to force public schools in this country to teach Intelligent Design (aka, "ID") as a valid scientific alternative to evolutionary theory.  </p>

<p>A few days ago, Myers was particularly impressed with an op-ed written by <a href="http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/02/2dee_edit.html">James Dee</a> of Austin, published in the Austin American-Statesman, in which Dee attempts to dismantle the logic behind the ID-as-science concept.</p>

<p>What caught my attention, though, was the way Myers <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/02/texas_isnt_all_bad.php">presented</a> this article&#151;with the title "Texas isn't all bad" and the opening line "There's always Austin."  This, of course, prompted many defenses of this state, including one from me where I stated, without much thought:  "In particular, I don't see any of these force-ID-into-public-schools fights happening in Texas."</p>

<p>Another commenter, <a href="https://thoughtpimp.blogspot.com">Paul W.</a>, then reminded me of the textbook wars&#151;the decades-long struggle by conservative religious forces here to shape the content of the books being used for teaching youngsters in public schools.  These people are trying to do far more to twist the minds of the children of this state than just confuse them about the relative scientific validity of ID and evolution.</p>

<p>For example, back in 1996, according to a timeline from the <a href="http://www.tfn.org/publiceducation/textbooks/timeline/index.php">Texas Freedom Network</a>:<blockquote><em>Censors attempt to delete certain photographs in new textbooks, saying publishers went “overboard” in their inclusion of minorities. They also claim the textbooks overemphasize the cruelty experienced by slaves, demand that the age of Earth to be determined by biblical genealogy rather than fossil evidence and attempt to eliminate discussions of endangered animals and environmental issues.</em></blockquote>Fortunately, while the activist religious conservatives have had some successess, such as getting publishers in 2002 to "remove passages in social studies textbooks that have positive references to Islam and that note any negative characteristics of capitalism," they have apparently failed so far in their attempts to interfere with the teaching of evolution in science classes.</p>

<p>The most recent failure came a little over two years ago, and here is described in a <a href="http://www.texscience.org/files/discovery/index.htm">press release</a> of that era from <a href="http://www.texscience.org/index.php">Texas Citizens for Science</a>.<blockquote><em>On November 6, 2003, the Texas State Board of Education voted 11-4 to adopt all the biology books on the conforming list subject only to normal error correction by the Texas Education Agency staff. On November 7, all the books were adopted unanimously by voice vote with no dissent. I am happy to report that the biology texts were not censored, weakened, or modified in any way that would reduce their scientific accuracy, especially about the topics of evolution and the origin of life. Four anti-evolutionists on the Board, led by Dr. Don McLeroy, did attempt to adopt only two biology books on the conforming list and adopt the others on the nonconforming list, thereby reducing their sales, but they failed in this attempt.</em></blockquote>I somehow missed all this at the time, perhaps distracted by the upcoming Democratic primary for the Presidential election, but it is great news in retrospect.  And the textbook publishers' resistance to the followup attempts at behind-the-scenes initimidation by McLeroy and other anti-evolutionists is also great news.  Many thanks are due to organizations such as the <a href="http://www.tfn.org/">Texas Freedom Network</a> that helped in this achievement.</p>

<p>Of course, the story does not end there.  The activist religious conservative minority on the elected State Board of Education is still trying to increase the Board's power over textbook content&#151;power that was greatly restricted by the state legislature back in 1995.  The <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8FFOF800.html">Dallas Morning-News</a> reported on January 31:<blockquote><em>Texas Board of Education members aligned with social conservatives have asked the state attorney general to strike down restrictions on their power to review and reject the content of public school textbooks. </p>

<p>The request was initiated by Republican Terri Leo of Spring, one of five board members aligned with social conservatives and a major critic of the 1996 legal opinion that has limited board control over textbook content. </p>

<p>Leo requested the opinion with the approval of board chairwoman Geraldine Miller. </p>

<p>The ruling from Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott will be closely watched because of Texas' influence in the textbook industry. Many books are tailored to the state's wishes and then marketed in other states. </p>

<p>Battles over content could touch on the teaching of evolution, what students are told about birth control and sexual abstinence, and interpretations of history. </p>

<p>Leo's request for a new opinion argued that the original one issued by former Attorney General Dan Morales was "erroneous on its face" and should be reversed, restoring full board authority over textbook selection. </p>

<p>The letter did not mention that the Legislature has repeatedly rejected bills over the past decade that would have given the board more control to screening and reject textbooks it might deem inappropriate for students. </p>

<p>Former state Sen. Bill Ratliff, who wrote the 1995 law that stripped the board of many of its powers and turned them over to local school boards, said he was "very clear" about his intention to include authority for textbook selection. </p>

<p>Ratliff, a Republican who later served as lieutenant governor, told The Dallas Morning News that Morales' opinion correctly interpreted the law. </p>

<p>"Nothing has changed," Ratliff said. "I am still sure that was the intent of the legislation."</em></blockquote>This would appear to be a quixotic quest.  Or do the social conservatives have a reason to think that GOP Attorney General Greg Abbott will rule differently on this apparently clear-cut matter of law than the conservative Democrat Dan Morales did ten years ago?</p>

<p>For even more on the current situation, and the background details, see this recent <a href="http://www.wacotrib.com/opin/content/shared/news/nation/stories/2006/02/YOUNG_COLUMN_0203_COX.html">editorial</a> by John Young of the Waco Tribune-Herald.</p>

<p>This is all a reminder to me that just because I don't see a battle going on doesn't mean it isn't there.  </p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/04/science/04climate.html?_r=1&ei=5094&en=6a15af4274e8942d&hp=&ex=1139029200&oref=slogin&partner=homepage&pagewanted=all">New York Times</a> has discovered that a 24-year old, intelligent-design-promoting press officer appointed by the White House has been interfering in the way that NASA presents its science results to the public, including insisting on controlling the public statements of renowned climate scientist James Hansen.<blockquote><em>The Big Bang memo came from Mr. [George] Deutsch, a 24-year-old presidential appointee in the press office at NASA headquarters whose résumé says he was an intern in the "war room" of the 2004 Bush-Cheney re-election campaign. A 2003 journalism graduate of Texas A&M, he was also the public-affairs officer who sought more control over Dr. Hansen's public statements. </p>

<p>In October 2005, Mr. Deutsch sent an e-mail message to Flint Wild, a NASA contractor working on a set of Web presentations about Einstein for middle-school students. The message said the word "theory" needed to be added after every mention of the Big Bang. </p>

<p>The Big Bang is "not proven fact; it is opinion," Mr. Deutsch wrote, adding, "It is not NASA's place, nor should it be to make a declaration such as this about the existence of the universe that discounts intelligent design by a creator." </p>

<p>It continued: "This is more than a science issue, it is a religious issue. And I would hate to think that young people would only be getting one-half of this debate from NASA. That would mean we had failed to properly educate the very people who rely on us for factual information the most."</p>

<p>The memo also noted that The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual specified the phrasing "Big Bang theory." Mr. Acosta, Mr. Deutsch's boss, said in an interview yesterday that for that reason, it should be used in all NASA documents. </p>

<p>The Deutsch memo was provided by an official at NASA headquarters who said he was upset with the effort to justify changes to descriptions of science by referring to politically charged issues like intelligent design. Senior NASA officials did not dispute the message's authenticity.</p>

<p>Mr. Wild declined to be interviewed; Mr. Deutsch did not respond to e-mail or phone messages. On Friday evening, repeated queries were made to the White House about how a young presidential appointee with no science background came to be supervising Web presentations on cosmology and interview requests to senior NASA scientists. </p>

<p>The only response came from Donald Tighe of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. "Science is respected and protected and highly valued by the administration," he said.</em></blockquote>The background on how the Times came to discover these latest abuses of science and scientists by the Bush administration:  </p>

<p>Last week, the Times reported of Dr. Hansen:<blockquote><em>[H]e was threatened with "dire consequences" if he continued to call for prompt action to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. He and intermediaries in the agency's 350-member public-affairs staff said the warnings came from White House appointees in NASA headquarters.</p>

<p>Other National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists and public-affairs employees came forward this week to say that beyond Dr. Hansen's case, there were several other instances in which political appointees had sought to control the flow of scientific information from the agency. </p>

<p>They called or e-mailed The Times and sent documents showing that news releases were delayed or altered to mesh with Bush administration policies.</em></blockquote>The revelations are so embarrassing that the administrator, Mike Griffin, didn't waste any time promising changes:<blockquote><em>On Thursday night and Friday, The Times sent some of the documents to Dr. Griffin and senior public-affairs officials requesting a response. </p>

<p>While Dr. Griffin did not respond directly, he issued the "statement of scientific openness" to agency employees, saying, "NASA has always been, is and will continue to be committed to open scientific and technical inquiry and dialogue with the public."</p>

<p>Because NASA encompasses a nationwide network of research centers on everything from cosmology to climate, Dr. Griffin said, some central coordination was necessary. But he added that changes in the public-affairs office's procedures "can and will be made," and that a revised policy would "be disseminated throughout the agency."</em></blockquote>Let's hope Griffin's new policy is true to his words and not undermined by his own bosses in the White House.</p>

<p>Keith Cowing at <a href="http://www.nasawatch.com/archives/2006/02/george_deutsch.html">NASA Watch</a> suggests Griffin should fire George Deutsch.  That's certainly a minimum.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Thanks to an attentive sister, last Friday I learned that the <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/travel/texasneighbors/stories/012906dntragovt.1f5e4b21.html">Dallas Morning-News</a> highlighted the San Antonio area's new wonder of a state park, <a href="../../2005/05/just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon State Natural Area</a>.  And I believe it was at the top of the front page!  Should we be expecting a flood of Dallas-ites down here soon?</p>

<p>Here are some highlights from the <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/fea/travel/texasneighbors/stories/012906dntragovt.1f5e4b21.html">article</a>:<blockquote><em>Its historical but off-putting name sounds like a new prison movie. But Government Canyon, the newest kid on the Texas Parks & Wildlife block, is an 8,622-acre gem, a mother lode of history, geology and scenery that almost went under the bulldozer's blade. </p>

<p>However, thanks to a national scandal and the passion of a small army of Texans, the state natural area in northwest Bexar County escaped development. Twelve years in the making, Government Canyon finally opened its gates in October. </p>

<p>The fact that Government Canyon is one of the state's eight natural areas rather than a park means that conservation, stewardship and education trump recreation. Not that there's a shortage of things to do at the remarkably serene sanctuary only 16 miles from the Alamo City. There are 20 picnic sites, a covered group pavilion with a huge limestone fireplace and barbecue pit and 41 miles of hiking and bike trails. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"We tried to keep the development footprint as light as possible," says Ranger Trey Cooksey, the canyon's assistant manager. "People should have places to go that aren't concrete." </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Given lean state budgets, Government Canyon probably will be the last addition to the Texas parks system for a long time. That makes this tranquil monument to public-private cooperation even more precious. </p>

<p>"All the stars aligned to make Government Canyon," says project manager Jason Corzine. "It's an oasis. Its potential will only be realized when every scrap of land around it is tract houses."</em></blockquote>Last addition to the state park system for a long time?  Not if <a href="http://www.texansforstateparks.org/default.asp">Texans for State Parks</a> can help it.</p>

				<p>The troubled budgetary situation of Texas' state park system that I've written about <a href="../../2005/12/texas_state_par.html">earlier</a> received some more press last weekend.  Both the <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8FD6SOG3.html">Dallas Morning-News</a> and the <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/3619036.html">Houston Chronicle</a>, along with at least a few other smaller newspapers, ran an AP article on the issue&#151an article that also discussed an organization that is attempting to rally the public to support the parks.<blockquote><em>For as long as she can remember, Beth McDonald has been a frequent visitor of Texas' state parks. Whether for camping, picnics or afternoon fishing trips, it was easy to load the family into the truck for an outdoor adventure. </p>

<p>"We practically raised our kids at Bastrop State Park," she said. </p>

<p>That's why an ongoing budget battle at the state Capitol, depleted funding and deteriorating conditions at Texas parks have her so upset. </p>

<p>Budget constraints have forced the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to cut hours and staff at state parks and limit maintenance. The changes have park enthusiasts hopping mad and calling on voters to make boosting funding an election issue. </p>

<p>"There is a firestorm igniting that will be in full force by election time," said McDonald, 79, a retired medical assistant and hospital administrator who now serves as the president of the non-profit Texans for State Parks group. </p>

<p>The group was meeting Friday and Saturday at Bastrop State Park to drum up support for its cause. The meeting should draw hundreds of supporters, McDonald said. </p>

<p>Formed in 1997, Texans for State Parks has about 150 members and another 35 affiliated parks groups around the state. </p>

<p>"We are not going to sit down idly by and watch our once beautiful parks go down the drain," McDonald said.</em></blockquote><a href="http://www.texansforstateparks.org/default.asp">Texans for State Parks</a>.  The organization has been around a few years, but their web site looks brand spanking new.  Check them out&#151;and consider helping to stoke the "firestorm" save our parks.</p>

<p>For more, see a mid-January op-ed by none other than Beth McDonald in the <a href="http://www.banderabulletin.com/articles/2006/01/18/news/letters/858.txt">Bandera Bulletin</a>.</p>

				<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/31/politics/politicsspecial1/31alito.html?hp&amp;ex=1138770000&amp;en=03153f62a6ddc865&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage">spectre</a> of Samuel Alito on the Supreme Court is extremely worrisome to those who care about the well-being of this country's democracy and a reasonable balance of power between monied interests and the rest of society. With the vote against the filibuster last night in the U.S. Senate, I notice at least a few progressive bloggers are using this occasion to rail against members of the Democratic Party, if not the entire party. </p>

<p>But Alito is a creature entirely of the Republican Party. While perhaps understandable to lash out in a moment of anguish, blaming the Democratic Party (or certain members thereof) is nonetheless completely misguided. It is the Bush administration and its toadies in the GOP that have forced Alito upon us. And it was our inability to convey our supposedly obvious and just cause to the general public, both in November 2004 and now, that has allowed his ascendancy. </p>

<p>Fortunately, many other progressive bloggers are taking a more sober look at the situation, celebrating those who helped in this battle, and resolving to figure out how to do better next time. For as dangerous as he is, Alito is only one vote in one branch of government.</p>
