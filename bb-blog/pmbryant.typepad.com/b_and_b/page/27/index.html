				<p>A mixture of bad news and absence of bad news from our corruptly-led Congress today:  the regressive budget bill passed by the slimmest of margins (no doubt <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/12/21/165851/78">by design</a>), yet the GOP's despicable tactic of attaching the extremely controversial proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the defense appropriations bill failed thanks to a filibuster by Democrats and a pair of Republicans.</p>

<p><a href="https://rhetoricrhythm.blogspot.com/2005/12/scrooge-mccheney.html">Mike Thomas</a> summarizes the budget bill at his blog, Rhetoric and Rhythm.</p>

<p>On the measure to drill in the Arctic Refuge, the Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/21/AR2005122101252.html">writes</a>:<blockquote><em>In debate before the cloture vote, [Senator Ted Stevens, R-Alaska] told fellow senators, "We know this Arctic. You don't know the Arctic at all." At issue, he said, was "2,000 acres of the Arctic," the amount of land in the refuge that would be opened for drilling. "Is that worth this fight?"</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said that even though the bill provides vital defense funding, he was joining the filibuster on principle to prevent attachments such as the drilling provision. "If we yield to this tactic on ANWR," he said, "next year it will be someone else's pet project attached to the defense spending bill."</em></blockquote>Stevens has trashed any remaining integrity he may have had with his actions in recent days, essentially holding funds for our troops and for relief for Katrina victims hostage to his pet project.</p>

<p>Kudos to Senator Lieberman for standing up to this blackmail and helping to defeat it.</p>

<p>Shame on Senator John McCain, who just yesterday <a href="http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=33057&dcn=todaysnews">talked</a> a good game about the legislative tactics of Stevens and others ("Our system is broken if our national security is at stake and we carry on spending for the special interests as if nothing were wrong"), but who was unwilling to do anything about it.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/12/arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-is.html">Matt</a> at Just Another Blog has more on the Arctic Refuge drilling vote.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Back in November, the B and B team, along with a couple friends and fellow bird watchers, visited what is often considered to be the best birding spot in the San Antonio area:  a former wastewater treatment plant, current wildlife refuge, called <a href="http://www.tx.audubon.org/mitchell.htm">Mitchell Lake</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, with our friends' help, we were able to identify over forty-five different species of birds that afternoon.  Now I don't keep formal lists or anything resembling them, but still, this was, by far, a record for me for a single day.  The species we saw included many life birds for me, such as stunning <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Northern_Pintail_dtl.html">Northern Pintails</a>, wacky <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Hooded_Merganser.html">Hooded Mergansers</a>, and cute <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Bufflehead.html">Buffleheads</a>.  So it was quite thrilling.</p>

<p>Until a year or so ago, Mitchell Lake was run by the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) and closed to the public except for guided tours given by <a href="http://www.saaudubon.org/">San Antonio Audubon</a> volunteers on occasional Saturday mornings.  Given the long drive from our house and the early hour of the walks, we never were able to make it to one of those events.  Now, though, the <a href="http://www.saws.org/latest_news/NewsDrill.cfm?news_id=217">National Audubon Society</a> manages the place for SAWS and opens it to the public all day on Saturdays.  So last winter, our two visits were our first experience with this bird wonderland.  </p>

<p>It was on one of these visits a year ago that I experienced one of my most embarrassing birding moments.  </p>

<p>Given Mitchell Lake's obscurity with the general public, but great reputation with local birders, I suspect that roughly 100% of its visitors are more knowledgeable about birds than I am.  So I don't consider myself a good judge of what birds are especially interesting to them.  (After all, I just added the relatively common Pintails, Mergansers, and Buffleheads to my non-existent life list a month ago.)  Nonetheless, when we passed a few other people on one of the trails after spending a couple hours inspecting the place, and they asked if we had seen anything of note, I felt confident enough to offer up a response.  I don't remember my exact words, but I do remember pointing up at the graceful, <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/American_White_Pelican.html">giant white birds</a> soaring in the distance, saying, "And those penguins, of course!"</p>

<p>The quizzical look I received in response eventually got me to realize what I had said, but only after I had finished my brief discourse. We all had a good laugh at the concept of penguins flying high over the countryside south of San Antonio.  And forevermore the other half of the B and B team has teased me about this slip of the tongue.</p>

<p>For instance, that recent, popular <a href="http://wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins/">documentary</a> about the birds that march dozens of miles across the Antarctic wasteland to hatch their chicks:  that movie is known as "March of the Pelicans" around here.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A small bit of good news from the U.S. Congress.  Of course, in this age of <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2002681963_floyd14.html">corrupt Republican leadership</a>, good news means a smaller amount of bad news than there would otherwise be.  The bad news that we are now without is the GOP's <a href="../../2005/11/gops_public_lan.html">sneak-attack</a> on our public lands.<blockquote><em>"It's a welcome stay of execution."</em></blockquote>So says the Superintendent of Death Valley National Park, J.T. Reynolds, as quoted in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/inland/la-me-mining14dec14,1,2307926,print.story?coll=la-editions-inland-news">Los Angeles Times</a> today.  The details:<blockquote><em>Republicans in Congress late Tuesday stripped proposed mining law revisions from a budget bill that critics said could have led to the sell-off of millions of acres of federal land, including portions of national parks and forests, such as Death Valley National Park and Mojave National Preserve.</p>

<p>The package faced mounting bipartisan opposition from Western senators, whose support was crucial, after scores of groups, including a coalition of hunting and fishing interests, complained. A Senate spokesman said opposition to the mining law revisions could have jeopardized passage of the budget bill. </p>

<p>In an interview with The Times, the author of the proposals, Rep. Jim Gibbons (R-Nev.), denied that criticism from park officials, hunting and fishing groups, and others had led to the decision. He said the furor was the result of "intentionally false and misleading information put out by anti-mining groups … that had no impact on the fact that we are here today."</p>

<p>Gibbons vowed to reintroduce what he called comprehensive mining reform legislation in the new year.</em></blockquote>We already know about the <a href="../../2005/12/gops_public_lan.html">massive criticism</a> of the Pombo-Gibbons provision in the budget reconciliation bill, including the <a href="../../2005/12/opposition_to_g.html">wishy-washy</a> opposition of a handful of western Republicans.  But what was the final straw?  I suspect it may have been this:<blockquote><em>On Tuesday, a coalition of more than two dozen hunting and fishing groups claiming to represent 55 million hunters and fishermen sent a letter to Rep. Jim Nussle, an Iowa Republican who chairs the House Budget Committee, and Rep. John M. Spratt Jr., a South Carolina Democrat and the committee's ranking minority member, expressing "serious concerns." </p>

<p>"America's hunters and anglers depend upon public lands and waters … to pursue their tradition of hunting and fishing," the groups wrote. "This proposal to sell public land is being universally poorly received throughout the hunting and angling community."</em></blockquote>Thanks to all who worked to kill this horrible idea.  Great job.</p>

<p>Now on to killing the next bad idea, of which there are <a href="http://www.ncccusa.org/news/051214CallousBudget.html">far</a>, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/14/AR2005121401728.html">far</a> <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/latestnews/stories/121505dntexfoodstamps.be79caa.html">too</a> <a href="http://www.airforcetimes.com/story.php?f=1-292925-1412774.php">many</a> coming from our so-called representatives in the House.</p>

<p>So the temporary lack of this one piece of bad news is hardly reason to celebrate.  Instead, it is well past time to throw these <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=1402192">corrupt</a> corporate elitists out on their ears and replace them with individuals who have the interests of the honest people of this country at heart.</p>

				<p>The sneaking of a provision to <a href="../../2005/11/gops_public_lan.html">sell off</a> our nation's public lands into a recently-passed budget bill&#151courtesy the GOP leadership in the persons of Rep. Richard Pombo and Rep. Jim Gibbons&#151;is attracting more and more negative attention&#151;from Democrats and Republicans and others in between.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-mining4dec04,1,3365324.story?coll=la-headlines-california">L.A. Times</a> published a reminder of the issues at stake earlier this week:<blockquote><em>Standing at the foot of billion-year-old Stripe Mountain, acting park chief [of Mojave National Preserve in California] Larry Whalon gazed up at ancient slopes banded in limestone and copper. </p>

<p>The entire mountain in the desert preserve west of Las Vegas is covered by federal mining claims, and newly proposed legislation would allow claim holders to purchase this land outright.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>This is not going down well with many <a href="http://rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4285528,00.html">governors</a> of western states, where most of the affected public land lies:<blockquote><em>Six western governors put Congress on notice this week they oppose a measure pending in the U.S. Senate that would open millions of acres of public lands for sale to mining companies. </p>

Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D., of the Senate Budget Committee, on Thursday saying the sale of public lands in a budget reconciliation bill passed by the House could cut off public access for recreation and deny the states billions of dollars in mineral royalties. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The letter was signed by Govs. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, Janet Napolitano of Arizona, Bill Richardson of New Mexico, Ted Kulongoski of Oregon, and Christine Gregoire of Washington.</em></blockquote>Note that all of these six western governors are Democrats.</p>

<p>Of course, some Republicans are not exactly thrilled about Pombo's and Gibbons' efforts either, given the huge outcry that has come from many hunters and fisherman who frequently vote Republican.  But their comments have been quite <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4295245,00.html">timid</a>.<blockquote><em>[Colorado Sen. Wayne] Allard ... said in a release Tuesday that it's worth considering reforms to the mining law, but not in the middle of the budget debate. </p>

<p>"Concerns about the implications of this provision have been raised by public interest groups and private property groups," Allard said. "I look forward to working with my colleagues to update the 1872 mining law, but I do not believe the provision under consideration by the conference committee is the way to achieve this needed reform of the law."</em></blockquote>Can a statement be much more half-hearted?  </p>

<p>In contrast, we have <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=politicsNews&storyID=uri:2005-12-07T025824Z_01_KNE710661_RTRUKOC_0_US-ENVIRONMENT-LAND.xml&pageNumber=1&summit=">this</a>:<blockquote><em>Outrage over the bill has risen to fever pitch in Montana, where U.S. Sen. Max Baucus, a Democrat, is leading the call to squelch the mining measure. "It's an abominable idea," he said in an interview Tuesday. "Our public lands are for the public.'' </p>

<p>Backers of the measure say it would authorize at most 360,000 acres for sale, funneling roughly $158 million into depleted federal coffers. Opponents say wording in the bill opens for sale millions of acres across the West, including some of the West's most prized landscapes. </p>

<p>A case in point in western Montana is Rock Creek, a blue-ribbon trout stream that draws tens of thousands each year to recreate in an area made famous for its abundance of cutthroat, elk, bighorn sheep and mountain goats. </p>

<p>The recreation site also is home to more than 3,700 mining claims, all of which could be sold, if the measure becomes law. </p>

<p>Walter Lore, who lives near Rock Creek and has been fishing and hunting there for years, said closing access to any part of the area would make Montanans "big-time upset. We might have a civil war."</em></blockquote></p>

<p>The Pombo-Gibbons provision is so bad, that even <a href="http://www.casperstartribune.net/articles/2005/12/04/news/regional/610f73c9aed3816e872570cc002693f8.txt">industry-friendly</a> former government officials are willing to say so&#151;and not in wishy-washy Allard words:<blockquote><em>The former top U.S. land manager for the biggest gold mining state in the nation says a proposal in Congress to privatize public mining lands "would be catastrophic, both environmentally and economically."</p>

<p>Bob Abbey, considered an ally of the mining industry before his retirement in June as the Bureau of Land Management's state director for Nevada, said the proposal by Republican Reps. Richard Pombo of California and Jim Gibbons of Nevada offers false hopes to rural communities to attract new businesses.</p>

<p>"There is nothing positive about this bill unless you happen to have ownership in a mining company," Abbey said.</p>

<p>"Having spent half my life managing the public's land and being a proponent of responsible mining, I assure you this legislation is bad for American taxpayers," he said in a letter first published Thursday in the Reno Gazette-Journal.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>It's time for Pombo-Gibbons, and the Republican leadership's efforts to privatize our public lands for the benefit of their financial backers, to be tossed in the slag heap of history.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In the seven years I have lived in Texas, this state has never been a big spender on public parks.  In a state with little in the way of national parks (aside from <a href="http://www.nps.gov/bibe/">Big Bend National Park</a> way out west, a full days' drive from the vast majority of Texas' citizens), this shortage of well-funded state parks is particularly acute.  The recent, long-delayed, <a href="../../2005/10/feature_on_gove.html">opening</a> of so substantial a new park as Government Canyon State Natural Area, so near to a major metropolital area, was thus very welcome news.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some unwelcome news is also on the way, as was <a href="http://www.lufkindailynews.com/news/content/news/stories/2005/11/13/20051113LDNparks.html">reported</a> last month:<blockquote><em>As the state develops its land the need for green escapes increases. Texas, [Texas Parks and Wildlife commissioner John Parker] said, needs five new parks with 5,000 acres each. </p>

<p>Instead, Parker has watched the state's treasure tarnish with each legislative budget cut. </p>

<p>"The legislature, House and Senate, failed to adequately fund the state park system and told them they were going to cut our budget 5 percent on top of the 15 percent cut the 78th legislature cut it," Parker said.</p>

<p>When state park system's regional directors convened in Austin this past week [early November], Parker was told they were considering drastic cuts to the state park system in order to balance the 2006 budget based on what the legislature had appropriated it. Immediately at stake are the jobs of up to 109 full time state park employees and 100-plus seasonal employees, Parker said. The further reduced budget will also mean closing parks and historical sites a few days a week. </p>

<p>"These sites are located across the state where school children are taken on field trips to see, touch and feel Texas history with their own eyes," Parker said as he drove through Friday morning's early fog en route to Martin Dies Jr. State Park outside Jasper. "The message we are giving with this latest cut that this legislature has forced is 'kids, we as legislators don't think it is important for you to have full advantage of the state historical sites like Caddoan Mounds in Alto or Mission Tejas four miles west of Alto.'"</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"So now we are at the edge of the cliff because of lack of concern from the state legislature," Parker said. "We'll have to start laying off employees, closing parks, closing historical sites and reducing hours. I just don't think the people of Texas want that to happen." </p>

<p>"Have you seen Arkansas' state parks since they renovated them?" Parker asked on the ride home. This was done by increasing the state sales tax less than a penny, knowing the enhanced green spaces would attract economic development, companies which value places for their employees to decompress. "Their state parks are magnificent!"</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Texas' state parks, while too few and too small for our population, are also magnificent, in my limited experience.  Just in central Texas, we have, among others, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/lost_maples/">Lost Maples State Natural Area</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/garner/">Garner State Park</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/hill_country/">Hill Country State Natural Area</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/guadalupe_river/">Guadalupe River State Park</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/enchanted_rock/">Enchanted Rock State Natural Area</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/pedernales_falls/">Pedernales Falls State Park</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/palmetto/">Palmetto State Park</a>, <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/findadest/parks/choke_canyon/">Choke Canyon State Park</a>.  And of course there are the showpieces I've written about before: just outside of San Antonio, <a href="../../2005/05/just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon State Natural Area</a>, and out in the wilds of west Texas, <a href="../../2005/12/the_saga_of_big.html">Big Bend Ranch State Park</a>.   </p>

<p>By underfunding our parks, locking them up several days a week and laying off staff, the Texas legislature is ensuring that fewer of the ever-increasing population of this state will be able to enjoy their magnificence.  Our quality of life will be diminished.  Certainly a great state such as Texas can do better.</p>

<p>Then again, there's a <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/3505049.html">lot of things</a> at which we should be doing better:<blockquote><em>AUSTIN - Texas is the only state in the nation that reduced education spending during the 2004-05 school year, according to a report released Monday by the National Education Association.</p>

<p>Per pupil expenditures fell by 1 percent from the previous year, and Texas dropped from 36th to 40th relative to other state's education investments.</em></blockquote>So are we a great state or not?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The Express-News confirms preliminary <a href="../../2005/12/walmart_abandon.html">reports</a> from Friday: "<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA120505WalMart.EN.44726370.html">Wal-Mart confirms it won't build in Helotes.</a>"  At least for the time being.<blockquote><em>The retail giant announced Monday that it is dropping more than a year of plans for a store on 32 acres at Texas 16 and Scenic Loop Road because it’s unwilling to battle the city in court. </p>

<p>In a written statement addressed to Helotes residents, Wal-Mart officials said they worked diligently to meet or exceed all the development and environmental requirements of the city, county and state, but ultimately decided to abandon their plans for the site. </p>

<p>“Though vocal opposition was present, many in the community expressed support for the project,” the statement read. “However, recent actions indicated that achieving a cooperative project was no longer possible. Although Wal-Mart is confident that these actions could have been remedied in court, Wal-Mart is unwilling to force the city of Helotes into expensive litigation relative to this site.”</blockquote></em></p>

<p>Of course, I don't see anything to rule out the possibility that they could just be moving a short distance down the road.  But I'll take good news where I can get it.  Congratulations to the <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.com/">Helotes Heritage Association</a> and their supporters.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>After a long, hot summer and early fall in which I had little time or energy with which to pursue many activities outside of the necessities, in the last few weeks, fall has finally begun in south central Texas.  With the belated arrival of cool air, I feel again the compelling urge to get outside and see the sensational sights that nature has to provide.  And that, of course, includes getting back to watching birds.</p>

<p>So, a few weeks ago, the B and B team travelled three hours down the road to the central Texas coast, to the <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/features/3408023.html">Rockport-Fulton</a> area, a renowned <a href="http://www.grandtimes.com/rockport.html">birding hotspot</a> north of Corpus Christi.  The quality and ease of bird watching there are indeed impressive, even for relative novices like ourselves.  Our only previous trip to that area, four years ago, had been the inspiration for us to purchase ourselves a nice pair of binoculars at long last.  It pushed us over the edge to being committed, if part-time, birders.</p>

<p>This time, alas, we did not have much time to spend&#151;it was a mere overnight trip.  But, by luck and circumstance, we found, and were able to splurge on, a very special place to stay.  A place that was to give us the opportunity to view whooping cranes for the first time&#151;and not just any viewing opportunity, but an up-close and personal one.</p>

<p>For those who may not be familiar with them, <a href="http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/whoopingcrane/">whooping cranes</a> are very tall, very endangered birds.  Fifty years ago there were less than two dozen of them left in the wild, all in a single flock that migrated from Wood Buffalo National Park in the wilds of northwestern Canada to a small peninsula on the central Texas coast northeast of Rockport&#151an area that had been preserved in the 1930s as the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/southwest/refuges/texas/aransas.html">Aransas National Wildlife Refuge</a>. Fortunately, thanks to the long, hard work of <a href="http://www.whoopingcrane.com/">many</a>, whooping cranes are recovering well&#151there are now over 200 cranes in the Aransas flock.  Unfortunately, the Aransas flock is still the only established flock, so the birds remain vulnerable to a single catastrophic event.  To guard against this, wildlife biologists and others are experimenting with establishing <a href="http://www.bringbackthecranes.org/">additional</a> flocks: one non-migratory one in central Florida and one migratory one between Wisconsin and Florida.</p>

<p>The vacation house we rented for that night is located on a ranch near some coastal wetlands, a portion of which the owners had recently donated to the Nature Conservancy.  The ranch is across a narrow inlet from the peninsula where the vast majority of the Aransas Refuge is located and where the wild flock of whooping cranes spend their winters, each family occupying roughly a square mile.  A family of whooping cranes had shown up virtually on the front door of this house in past winters, to eat the corn that had originally been put out to feed white-tailed deer.</p>

<p>Having never seen a <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Whooping_Crane.html">whooping crane</a>&#151;for that matter, having never seen any other type of crane before&#151;we didn't know what to expect.  Would they be immediately obvious or not?  Our previous visit to Aransas had been in early October&#151too early to see whoopers.  Now, we were visiting in mid-November, when about half the cranes would have arrived at their wintering grounds, but half would still be in transit.  With great timing for us, the pair of cranes that claim the territory around this house showed up two days before our trip.</p>

<p>Our arrival was only a couple hours past, when, as we were returning to the house from a short excursion to spot ducks and other water birds along the coastal wetlands, we saw two huge white birds, with black wing tips, swooping in for a landing on the road, just fifty feet or so in front of the house.  No field guides were needed for this identification!  Alas, the cranes were quicker than us, for we had not yet put out the deer corn as the proprietor had suggested.  So the whoopers promptly took off again and headed the short distance back towards the bay.</p>

<p>Taking our cue, we spread a bucket of the corn along the road, then went out again to look for birds in the coastal marshes, identifying several species that we had never before (such as <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Sandhill_Crane.html">sandhill cranes</a>, <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Green-winged_Teal.html">green-winged teals</a>, and <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Pied-billed_Grebe.html">pied-billed grebes</a>) as well as numerous old favorites (such as <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Great_Egret.html#map">great egrets</a>, <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Little_Blue_Heron.html">little blue herons</a>, and some "Mexican eagles", <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Crested_Caracara.html">crested caracaras</a>).  We even found the pair of whooping cranes, one of which was masking its height by sitting down in a dry, bare spot amidst the grasses&#151;perhaps resting from its recent journey from northern Canada.</p>

<p>While we were out, we noticed the whoopers fly low towards the house at least two more times, but not landing either time&#151;instead circling around and then heading back towards where they had been resting earlier.  When we returned to the house, we realized why&#151;the two horses living on the ranch were in the road taking their fill of the deer corn.</p>

<p>Eventually, the horses moved on, and a herd of deer and a family of three sandhill cranes&#151two adults and one juvenile&#151;decided to take over the feeding spot.  We settled down in the screened-in porch, a few dozen feet away, to watch.  Sandhill cranes were a new species for us as well.  They are duskier-colored and shorter than whoopers, though not exactly small themselves.</p>

<p>Before long, the whoopers swooped in again, with their long wingspans dwarfing the small shrubs near the road and attracting the attention of the feeding deer and sandhills.  They landed and started moving in towards the feeding area, walking slowly but steadily along the road.  As they did, the sandhill cranes retreated, as did most of the deer.  The few deer who stubbornly continued feeding soon found themselves being charged, pecked at, and honked at repeatedly by two very large, very loud birds.  Needless to say, these stubborn deer didn't stick around for long.</p>

<p>And so we watched quietly for the next hour from inside our comfortable blind, as the two whoopers took turns eating and keeping lookout, trumpeting loudly with their namesake "whoops" whenever any impatient deer tried to sneak back onto the road. </p>

<p>As the sun neared the horizon behind us, the whoopers suddenly faced east together, gracefully lofted themselves into the air, and headed towards the marshes.  The three sandhill cranes, who had been waiting patiently a distance away, moved back in to eat.  They stayed until well after sunset, kept up late by their deference to their larger cousins.  And then they, too, flew off quietly into the approaching night.</p>

				<p>Some unexpected, potentially big news on the <a href="../../2005/11/helotes_walmart.html">Wal-Mart/Helotes</a> front.  From the San Antonio Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA120205.walmart.EN.34479229.html">today</a>:<br />
<em><blockquote>The world's largest retailer unofficially is pulling out of its plans to build a supercenter outside Helotes. </p>

<p>Wal-Mart officials won't confirm that they're tossing plans to build a store at Texas 16 and Scenic Loop Road, but property owner Balous Miller said the project is a no-go. </p>

<p>"Wal-Mart is going away," he said, adding that he hasn't received any written notice. </p>

<p>Councilman Jim Caruso said Wal-Mart real estate manager Matt Smith notified him of the move Thursday. </p>

<p>"Matt felt he wanted to at least contact me because I was a pro Wal-Mart advocate and wanted to see the store come into the city," Caruso said. "He felt he ought to give us a call and tell us that Wal-Mart for the time being opted not to develop on that particular site at Bandera and Scenic Loop Road there. </p>

<p>"He didn't get into a whole lot of details or specifics there, but just basically told me that they had a change of plans and he said he hoped to do something in the future." </p>

<p>Smith wouldn't verify the plans, but said the retailer "still has hopes to do a project in Helotes."</p>

<p>He declined to comment further. </p>

<p>Mayor Jon Allan said Smith denied the scrapped plans when Allan called him early Friday. </p>

<p>"But when I talk to Jim Caruso, I get a whole different story, so it sounds like Matt Smith didn't want to share the information with me," he said. </p>

<p>Wal-Mart spokeswoman Kim Randle wouldn't comment further. </p>

<p>Allan, who ran on a mayoral platform of opposing the retailer, said he's not celebrating yet. </p>

<p>"We've had rumors in the past that Wal-Mart was pulling out and going somewhere else, and it turned out not to be true, so I'd hesitate to pop the champagne cork until we hear something final," he said.</blockquote></em></p>

<p>Great news, if true.  But I completely agree with Jon Allan's words.  </p>
