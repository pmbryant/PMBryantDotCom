				<p>Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York announced on Friday that he is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/17/AR2006031701735.html">retiring</a>, after more than two decades in Congress.  One of the few Republicans in D.C. with sensible priorities on science and environmental protection, he has been the chair of the House Science Committee for the last few years.  In that role, he has stood up to the Bush administration and the GOP leadership on a few issues where their priorities are badly misplaced.  In particular, he has been vocal in <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">favor</a> of NASA's embattled Earth-observing missions and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2005-07-18-warming-congress_x.htm">against</a> harassment of scientists working on global warming issues.</p>

<p>Rather than replace Boehlert as head of the Science Committee with a GOP member who shares their hostility to much current scientific research on certain subjects, the House Republican leadership is reportedly considering the idea of simply abolishing the Science Committee.  <a href="http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/031606/boehlert.html">The Hill</a> reported last week (via <a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/archives/000880.html">Space Politics</a>):<blockquote><em>GOP insiders were not surprised by [Boehlert's] announcement given that he had heart bypass surgery after winning reelection in 2004 and that House GOP leaders are considering a plan to abolish the Science Committee, which Boehlert chairs, as part of a plan to reorganize the committee structure.</em></blockquote>If they follow through with this idea, it would certainly be symbolic of the attitude of Washington Republicans towards science.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>David Sibley, famous bird expert, author, and artist, and now the most famous ivory-billed skeptic, has a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/03/17/wpecker117.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/03/17/ixnewstop.html">story</a> describing how he came to his conclusion that the bird in the 2004 Luneau video is not the long-missing Ivory-billed Woodpecker, but rather a common Pileated Woodpecker.  In it he writes about his reaction to the initial announcement of the ivory-billed's rediscovery last year,<blockquote><em>I studied the paper and watched the video as soon as it was posted. Mostly I studied maps, dates, and locations of sightings. I accepted the reported proof without question.</em></blockquote>He then describes his trip to the woods of Arkansas himself, where he saw many Pileated Woodpeckers but no Ivory-billeds.  When he returned home, he watched the Luneau video again.  His new reaction:<blockquote><em>Instead of seeing an ivory-bill, there was a bird that looked like a pileated - small, grainy, and blurry, but just like all the pileated woodpeckers I had seen in Arkansas. I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach. I looked again and again, trying to refute my own conclusion, and I wept as the realisation set in - that this was not an ivory-billed woodpecker, and that this was a mistake that could have profound repercussions in the birding and conservation communities.</em></blockquote>I don't know if he is correct or not, but this story may help to explain why his analysis of the video, published yesterday in Science magazine, is not nearly as <a href="../../2006/03/ivorybilled_que.html">thorough</a> as the original one by the Cornell team led by John Fitzpatrick.  </p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2006/03/ivorybilled_que.html">Ivory-billed questions</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>There is a new paper out in Science magazine that purports to cast doubt on the last year's celebrated rediscovery of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker in the forests of Arkansas. The first author is David Sibley, renowned birding author and artist. Sibley's target—the brief, blurry video, shot by David Luneau in 2004, that is the only photographic evidence yet presented for the woodpecker's modern existence. Sibley and his co-authors argue that the bird seen in that video is, in fact, a common Pileated Woodpecker.</p>

<p>In response to this new paper, some of my favorite bird bloggers are giving up on the Ivory-billed. GrrlScientist at Living the Scientific Life wrote a post titled, &quot;<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2006/03/goodbye_beautiful_dream.php">Goodbye Beautiful Dream</a>&quot;, saying, &quot;This bird's existence becomes less credible, more tenuous, with every passing day.&quot; Nuthatch at <a href="http://www.bootstrap-analysis.com/2006/03/sibleys_science.html">Boostrap Analysis</a> wrote, &quot;In the world of science, a situation of this nature would generally be considered to be at the 'back to the drawing board' stage. And I think that's where the IBWO is at. Still awaiting rediscovery.&quot;</p>

<p>After reading the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/311/5767/1555a.pdf">Sibley</a> paper, and the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/311/5767/1555b.pdf">response</a> to it written by the team that announced the original re-discovery last year, I am not so ready to give up. In fact, reading once again the evidence that the Cornell team led by John Fitzpatrick has put together, as well as their comprehensive analysis of the grainy video, I am impressed anew at the strength of their case. In comparison, the analysis by Sibley and his collaborators appears incomplete—their conclusions, therefore, unconvincing.</p>

<p>I have only yet briefly perused the evidence on both sides at this point, so my opinions may evolve. But right now, I am troubled by the tendency of Sibley and his collaborators to casually dismiss evidence contradicting the pileated hypothesis and supporting the ivory-billed hypothesis. </p>

<p>To take one example, Fitzpatrick's team has suggestive evidence that the fast wingbeats and direct flight-pattern of the bird in the video is far more consistent with the ivory-billed hypothesis than the pileated. Sibley dismisses this in one sentence at the end of his paper: &quot;We agree that 'we lack sufficiently comparable data for objective comparison' of these features.&quot; He and his co-authors spend a little more space on this subject in the supplemental materials, stating that &quot;identification based on the wingbeat rate of the bird in the Arkansas video requires clear evidence both that it can be matched by an ivory-billed woodpecker and that it cannot be matched by a pileated woodpecker.&quot; </p>

<p>The wingbeat rate of ivory-billeds is unknown, but the Cornell team has presented suggestive historical evidence that it is similar to the wingbeat rate of the bird in the video. The wingbeat rate of pileateds should be simple to measure, since they are so common. But Sibley's group has apparently made no effort to study this. The Cornell group, on the other hand, has looked into this issue and reports on their <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/ivory/rediscovery/support/frequency/document_view">web site</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The wingbeat frequencies of Pileated Woodpeckers in our videos from Arkansas are 2-4 beats per second in level flight (many examples) and 4-7.5 beats for short periods during hasty departures (n = 5). Moreover, experts who have studied Pileated Woodpecker flight using video analysis timed the fastest departures at 7 beats per sec (Tobalske 1996, personal communication). Thus, wingbeat frequency of the woodpecker in the Luneau video [8.6 per second] is faster than any recorded Pileated Woodpecker.</em></p></blockquote><p>Sibley's case would be more persuasive if he took this evidence contradicting his hypothesis more seriously. On this point, this is not a mere argument over the precise placement and color of a few pixels in a fuzzy image. </p><p>As another example, Sibley and his co-authors gloss over the substantial amount of non-video evidence that the Cornell team published a year ago.</p><blockquote><p><em>The recent sight records (1, 4) were all very brief and most involved a single observer, matching the pattern of reported observations over the past few decades (5–8). Although such observations provide strong impetus for continued searching and habitat protection, they cannot be taken to confirm the species' presence because they do not provide independently verifiable evidence.</em></p></blockquote><p>The Cornell team, naturally, does not take lightly this casual dismissal of the bulk of the evidence bolstering their case. They write, in a footnote in their response to Sibley's paper:</p><blockquote><p><em>Sibley et al. (2) incorrectly claim that the sight records we reported (1, 10) ‘‘were all very brief and most involved a single observer, matching the pattern of reported observations over the past few decades.’’ In no case since the 1940s was a report of an ivory-billed woodpecker (such as the original one by Gene Sparling) promptly followed by multiple repeat sightings in the same area—sightings that included a close encounter shared by two individuals, each having extensive experience with pileated woodpeckers in southern forests. After studying the evidence at length, the Bird Records Committee of the Arkansas Audubon Society voted unanimously to accept the documentation of ivorybilled woodpecker (www.arbirds.org/ivory_billed_woodpecker.html). Comparable validation by critical and experienced local experts has not occurred following any previous report of this species.</em></p></blockquote><p>No one would give a hoot about this video if there hadn't been so many other sightings by so many experienced individuals in the same area in a short span of time. By not acknowledging the significance of these sightings, Sibley shortchanges his own argument.</p><p>This whole controversy should be moot relatively soon. With the exhaustive nature of the search that has been going on in the Arkansas woods this winter, if the Ivory-billed Woodpecker inhabits those forests, there should be plenty more circumstantial evidence soon forthcoming. If no such evidence is presented over the next few months, then strong skepticism of the continued existence of the ivory-billed will be more than justified.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				I'm starting to feel like a broken record on this.

Headlines are once more trumpeting the discovery of an extra-solar planet&#151;one of well over a hundred that have been revealed within the last decade.  This one is apparently not "<a href="../../2006/01/another_noneart.html">Earth-like</a>," as a couple others were erroneously described, but rather a "<a href="https://msnbc.msn.com/id/11812276/">Super-Earth.</a>"  <blockquote><em><p>Astronomers on Monday announced the discovery of a frigid extrasolar planet several times larger than Earth, orbiting a small red dwarf star roughly 9,000 light-years away.</P><p>The finding alters astronomers' perceptions of solar system formation and the distribution of planets in the galaxy, suggesting that large rock-ice worlds might outnumber gas giants like Jupiter.</p><p>The newfound planet is about 13 times heavier than Earth and likely has an icy and rocky but barren terrestrial surface, and is one of the coldest planets ever discovered outside of our solar system.</em></blockquote>As we have repeatedly seen, though, we can't believe everything we read in the press.  So it pays to go to the original material.<p>Like the planet discovery I wrote about earlier this year, this one was produced by a group of astronomers that have built a system&#151;called <a href="http://bulge.princeton.edu/~ogle/">OGLE</a>, for Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment&#151;that monitors millions of distant stars in small regions of the sky, searching for a few cases where intervening objects pass in front.  When that happens, the light of the more distant object is bent (thanks to Einstein's general relativity) and focused to cause a temporary brightening&#151;a process known as gravitational lensing.  As the invisible foreground object passes by, the background object eventually returns to its original brightness.  The pattern of brightening and dimming over time is called the "light curve."<p><a href="http://bulge.princeton.edu/~ogle/ogle3/blg169.png"><img alt="Blg169_1" title="Blg169_1" src="../../images/blg169_1.png" width="220" height="222" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>
All we know about the planet is based on the shape of the light curve&#151actually, on the difference between the shape of the light curve and the best-fit model of a single star acting as the lens.  In this case, that difference is a few percent at most and lasted a mere couple hours.  The observational achievement is impressive and the result of years of effort in constructing the OGLE system.<p>Astronomers are masters at extracting the maximum amount of information from a minimum of data, and this case is a good example.  From the light curve of the entire lensing event, the astronomers make estimates of the mass of the star, the mass of the planet, the separation of the two, and their distance from us. Unfortunately, the process of extracting the information is full of large uncertainties, so the final results are also highly uncertain.<p>In the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0603276">scientific paper</a> where the results are written up, the astronomers claim that the 90% confidence interval on the mass of the parent star is 0.2 to 0.72 times the mass of our Sun&#151;an uncertainty of over a factor of three.  The distance to the lensing system is also uncertain by a factor of three, meaning that the projected distance of this planet from its parent is uncertain by a similar factor&#151;from a bit over one A.U. (the distance of Earth from the Sun) to over 4 A.U. (not quite Jupiter's distance from the Sun).  (Note that this distance serves only as a lower limit to the true separation in space due to projection effects.)<p>The ratio of the mass of the planet to that of its parent star is uncertain by a factor of two, bringing the total uncertainty in the planet's mass to a factor of seven&#151;from a bit over three times Earth's mass to over twenty times.  Uranus and Neptune are the only planets in our Solar System that fit within that mass range (15 and 17 Earth masses, respectively).<p>Inevitably, but unfortunately, all this uncertainty gets wiped away during the transition from scientific paper to journalistic article.  Also inevitably, terms that astronomers use to hype their own results are adopted and used uncritically by reporters.<p>The lead author of the team that produced this result, Andrew Gould of Ohio State University, repeatedly labels his new find an "icy super-Earth" when quoted by reporters.  But in the scientific paper submitted to Astrophysical Journal Letters, that phrase is never used&#151;and "super-Earth" is only used once, in this sentence:  "[These two new planets discovered with gravitational lensing] must have a large fraction of rock and ice, but whether these are covered with a thick coat of gas, like Uranus and Neptune, or whether they are “naked” super-Earths such as are theorized to have formed the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, is unclear."<p>Gould is clearly using the "icy super-Earth" phrase in his public statements to get press attention.  An equally (perhaps more) accurate alternative&#151;"Gassy Neptune-like world"&#151;would not attract nearly the same attention.  Well over a hundred extrasolar planets have been discovered in the last decade&#151;what's one more without a catchy slogan?<p>As in this case, good, interesting scientific results can get buried under a mass of speculation and over-enthusiastic extrapolation when communicated to the general public.  Scientists do this amongst themselves for fun, to help direct their research in productive directions, and of course to promote their own line of inquiry to their funders.  But I suspect this just leads to confusion amongst reporters and readers, and diminishes the public impact and understanding of later, more refined and more accurate, results when they come in.<p>If NASA's recent decision holds to <a href="https://msnbc.msn.com/id/11427824/">indefinitely delay</a> the Terrestrial Planet Finder mission&#151;designed to allow us, for the first time in human history, to detect planets roughly the size of Earth at roughly the distance from their parent stars to be conducive to life&#151perhaps it is because, thanks to all the recent hype, the public already thinks we have the capability to find "Earth-like" planets?

				<p>The B and B team voted just as the polls closed last night (one of us was literally the last one in the door), and helped state Rep. Carlos Uresti <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA030806.01A.uresti.410dc8c.html">knock off</a> incumbent State Sen. Frank Madla in the hotly-contested race for the Texas state senate. </p>

Religious extremist, Leininger-supported, Cynthia Dunbar walloped Tony Dale, 64%-36%, while incumbent Dan Montgomery only pulled 35% in his race against former Rep. Ken Mercer, who has just under 50% (95 votes shy out of 50,000 with all the precincts reporting).&nbsp; </p>

<p>If Mercer stays under 50%, there will be a runoff and Montgomery is not dead yet.&nbsp; I wish I could have voted in that contest—it is my district, after all—but due to the closed primary system and the lack of a Democratic candidate for that state board seat, I feel a bit disenfranchised in that race.</p>

				<p>Today is primary day in Texas. </p>

<p>National attention is focusing on how well the indicted former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay performs in his GOP primary and also on former congressman Ciro Rodriguez's <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/3/6/112321/6931">challenge</a> to incumbent Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar in a south Texas congressional district stretching from San Antonio to Laredo. The conservative, Bush-friendly, Laredo-resident Cuellar ousted then-incumbent, San Antonio-resident Rodriguez in 2004 by a few dozen votes in a primary election that saw the mysterious late appearance of a few dozen votes from Laredo—votes that pushed Cuellar over the top. Now Rodriguez is trying to win his seat back, and is hoping for a big turnout in the San Antonio portion of the district to do so.</p>

<p>Statewide attention is focusing on a few GOP primaries for the legislature, where five incumbents are being <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2006/03/james-leininger-and-leininger-five.html">challenged</a> by candidates funded virtually exclusively by the wealthy religious conservative James Leininger; on Chris Bell and Bob Gammage vying for the Democratic nomination for governor; and on the Democratic state senate <a href="../../2006/02/uresti_v_madla_.html">Uresti v. Madla</a> race in my neck of the woods, which has amazingly gotten even uglier in the couple weeks since I wrote about it.</p>

<p>But behind these high-profile races, there is much more.</p>

<p>In the ongoing <a href="../../2006/02/texas_textbook_.html">political fight</a> over the content of Texas public schools' textbooks, two GOP primaries for the Texas State Board of Education are worth keeping an eye on tonight. Religious extremists are looking to replace two members of the state board with two of their own. They already control at least five seats of the fifteen on the board. Apparently no Democrats are running in either race, so the GOP primary is where all the action is.</p>

<p>In district 10, stretching from the area north of Austin to the western suburbs of Houston, a moderate incumbent board member is stepping down. The GOP candidates in the race to replace her are Cynthia Dunbar and Tony Dale.</p>

<p>Dunbar is funded virtually exclusively by the family of notorious billionaire James Leininger, the same fellow funding primary challenges to many of the few remaining sensible Republicans in the state legislature. Dunbar homeschools her children and believes, according to a press release on her web site, that &quot;all students should be taught to be patriots.&quot; The Austin American-Statesman <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/news/stories/local/02/20SBOE.html">reports</a>, &quot;Dunbar said that she would support an intelligent design curriculum and that the concept is 'at least as viable, if not more so, than evolution.'&quot;</p>

<p>Tony Dale is endorsed by the retiring incumbent, Cynthia Thornton, and, unlike Dunbar, sends his child to public schools. In further contrast to Dunbar, he is not an activist in the anti-evolution movement. The American-Statesman writes, &quot;Dale said that the [ID curriculum] issue has been settled and that unless the law is revisited, parents must teach those values at home and in church.&quot; He stresses 'local control' of schools, which is contrary to the desires of the extremists, who want to take over the State Board and then dictate standards for the entire state.</p>

<p>In district 5—which encompasses northern Bexar County (including my area), much of Austin, and most of the central Texas Hill Country—former San Antonio state legislator Ken Mercer and physicist Mark Loewe are challenging the incumbent board member Dan Montgomery in the GOP primary.</p>

<p>Mercer, based on his campaign website, is allying himself with the extremist faction. He wants more state control of public schools, and also wants to enforce ideological purity in the GOP. The San Antonio Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA022006.9G.boardofed.21081d49.html">quoted</a> him saying, &quot;I want to restore some of the power to the state board that was stripped by the Legislature in 1995. I have good relationships with folks in the House and the Senate and I want to work with them to restore that power.&quot; On the anti-evolution front, he says, according to the American-Statesman, &quot;We should let kids hear both sides of the story.&quot; This puts him firmly in the ID-promoting camp.</p>

<p>Incumbent Montgomery, like Tony Dale, is a &quot;local control&quot; promoter. This has apparently earned him the enmity of the extremist camp. Also, he says, as paraphrased by the American-Statesman, that &quot;the strengths and weaknesses of the theory of evolution should be taught but that science classes should be restricted to subjects supported by scientific evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>The other challenger, Mark Loewe, is a physicist from Austin. He doesn't fit neatly into the GOP schism over local versus state control of schools. The Express-News writes about him: &quot;Loewe frequently testifies before the state board and both the House and Senate education committees. He's developed detailed plans on how to save the state money on textbook purchasing. Loewe said cheaper textbooks would mean students could keep them and build their own resource library.&quot;</p>

<p>We'll know soon if the religious extremists succeed or fail in replacing two, somewhat sensible, GOP members of the State Board of Education with two more members allied with the cause of dictating ideological content of textbooks throughout the state's public schools and promoting the non-scientific dogma of Intelligent Design in science classrooms.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>At a congressional hearing on the budget situation for NASA's science programs last week, Dr. Berrion Moore, Director of the Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space at the University of New Hampshire, testified about the budget's effects on Earth science programs.  Moore was a member of the National Academy of Science panel that <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">last spring</a> warned that NASA's system of Earth-observing satellites was "on the verge of collapse," so he is well-placed to provide an update on what has changed since then. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, as I hinted at <a href="../../2006/02/global_precipit.html">earlier</a>, the changes have not been for the better.  I will write more on this soon, but meanwhile check out his full <a href="http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=19810">statement</a> in front of the House science committee, and an article in the <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/science/3702250.html">Houston Chronicle</a> about the troubled situation of NASA's Earth science programs.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>An op-ed published by the Houston Chronicle last weekend serves as an excellent reminder of the ultimate goal of those in the GOP who desire to privatize our public lands. The Cato Institute authors <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/outlook/3687139.html">write</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Some object to privatization because they believe that our national &quot;crown jewels&quot; (however defined) are sacred natural treasures and that no price tag can or should be attached to them. Well, one is welcome to one's beliefs, but value is subjective. Land is worth only what people will pay for it.</em></p></blockquote><p>They also write:</p><blockquote><p><em>If there is more money to be made by turning the Grand Canyon over to the Walt Disney Co. rather than to an eco-sensitive tourism cooperative, it simply means that the public demand for Disney's services at the Grand Canyon is greater than the public's demand for Deep Green Trail Services Inc.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is a philosophy that places zero value on public land of any kind—in fact, zero value on anything non-monetary.&nbsp; &quot;Turning the Grand Canyon over&quot; to a private enterprise, whatever its marketing angle, is taken for granted.</p>
<p>In this world, there are no National Forests, no National Parks. &quot;<a href="http://www.hehd.clemson.edu/PRTM/textonly/Hartzog.htm">America's greatest idea</a>&quot; is no more.</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2006/02/an_unexpected_b.html">An unexpected bird of prey</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>My second excursion of the Great Backyard Bird Count <a href="../../2006/02/great_backyard_.html">weekend</a> was a second outing into a cold, dreary landscape. My bird watching partner decided against joining me outside and many of the local birds appeared to be following her lead. At midday, the temperature was hovering near forty degrees Fahrenheit, as the Texas winter held us in its last grasp.</p>

<p>I started by sitting on our deck and staring at our feeders—one filled with sunflower seed and two filled with thistle. In contrast to the typical feverish avian activity in our backyard, all I saw was a solitary Black-crested Titmouse—his usual companions absent. After fifteen minutes watching this fellow eat all by himself, I decided to venture out into the neighborhood. If the birds would not come to me, I would have to go to them. As a further benefit, going for a walk would help keep my feet from going numb.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the walk revealed a few more birds—but only a few. A Western Scrub-Jay was hanging out on the side of the road in front of our house. A lone male Northern Cardinal perched not far away. Far off the distance, a vulture of indeterminate species soared.</p>

<p>Most of the local birds were clearly not going to show themselves to me this day. Where were the Carolina Chickadees? The House Finches? The White-winged doves? The Northern Mockingbirds? The Golden-fronted Woodpeckers? Trying to shelter themselves from the unusual cold, no doubt.</p>

<p>Shortly after I turned into the overgrown alley that headed back to our yard, a mystery bird materialized, hunkered down with its feathers puffed up at the top of a leafless oak tree. Was it a robin? I hadn't seen many of those this winter. Repositioning myself to see it from the front, I could tell it had no red breast and so wasn't a robin. After a few minutes puzzling over its identity, it flew and revealed itself as another Scrub-Jay. Perhaps the same one I had seen earlier.</p>

<p>A minute later, a small bird in showed up in a cedar immediately to the side of the alley, just a few feet away. It moved around constantly and was hard to identify, but I persisted and eventually pinned it down as an Orange-crowned Warbler.</p>

<p>A few more dozen feet down the alley, nothing else had appeared. My circuit was nearing completion. Oh well, I thought. It's brutally cold for this area and the birds aren't active. I have an honest, if modest count, of a single individual of several different species.</p>

<p>I was back to our property line, just a couple hundred feet from the house. The alley was now surrounded by dense growths of cedar trees. As I resumed walking after another fruitless scan of my surroundings, I heard a loud rustle to my left. Stopping abruptly, I peered into the tangle. I ducked down to get a better view under the branches. That's when I saw it.</p>

<p>A hawk! On the ground, barely five feet away from me. It hopped a few more feet into the brush as I watched, but then stopped again. I shifted slightly to get an unobstructed view. The hawk had a dead, gray, fuzzy rodent of some sort in its talons. It had dragged this prey behind him as he hopped in its initial attempt to retreat from me.</p>

<p>The hawk had ragged vertical streaks on its upper chest, black and brownish crosswise stripes on its tail, and a prominent yellow patch at the base of its beak. Its back and wings were mottled and dark reddish brown. As I watched the hawk, it held its wings out and spread its tail to form an umbrella over its prey—a not-so-successful attempt to keep the carcass out of my view. Perhaps the hawk thought me a threat to its hard-won meal. It took a few more hops into the woods, dragging its meal along with it. I shifted again to keep my view, but soon decided to leave it alone to eat, and returned the short distance home in excitement.</p>

<p>After exploring field guides and online photographs, I am fairly confident that this hawk was a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk. When we've seen hawks in our yard in the past—always either flying over or perched high in a barren tree—they've been adult Red-shouldered Hawks. Seeing a juvenile was a first for our home bird watching; seeing a bird of prey in the midst of a meal was also a first. If it hadn't decided to try to drag its prey further into the woods as I walked past, I likely would not have seen it at all. Perhaps adult hawks are more careful about making noise when we walk past one of their meals?</p>

<p>The next day, the weather had warmed up a bit, and I took my partner out to inspect the scene of the crime. She was hoping to spot some bones or other evidence of the kill, hoping that the victim had not been the rabbit she calls &quot;Hippity&quot; that commonly browses outside our windows.</p>

<p>The scene was not hard to relocate. Amidst the monotony of overgrown cedar, just a few feet off the road, was a neat circle of gray fur. From a distance, it resembled a pelt. Indeed, this must have been a rabbit, she said. After poking around the undergrowth, we could find nothing else remaining.</p>

<p>As it turned out, &quot;Hippity&quot; showed up that evening at twilight, as usual. He had survived to eat another day. A relative of his had not been so fortunate.</p>
