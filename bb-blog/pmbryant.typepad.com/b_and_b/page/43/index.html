					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2005/02/high_praise_for.html">High praise for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>I have not had the heart to pay close attention to recent happenings in Washington.&nbsp; But via <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/003534.html" title="The Carpetbagger Report: Reid earning wide praise -- and deserving every word of it">The Carpetbagger Report</a>, I hear that Senator Harry Reid, the new Democratic Minority Leader after the defeat of Tom Daschle last November, is receiving high praise for his deft work as an opposition leader.&nbsp; What has he done so far?</p>

<ul><li>He has &quot;put in place a level of discipline and unity that has rarely been seen in recent years,&quot; according to Senate Democrats.</li>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<li>He has vowed not to be cowed by the inevitable GOP attempts to smear him:&nbsp; &quot;They're not going to frighten me. You know, they call me an obstructionist -- they're destructionists.&quot;&nbsp; And he added, &quot;I'm going to continue [working for 'fair, reasonable' legislation], no matter what personal attacks they make on me.&quot;</li>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<li>He has inspired the other Senate Democrats to stand up to defend him from the GOP's smear campaign.&nbsp; As reported in the Washington Post, &quot;Each of Reid's 43 Democratic colleagues, plus a Democratic-leaning independent, signed a letter to President Bush, urging him to halt the &quot;counter-productive attacks&quot; against Reid by the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.&quot;</li>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<li>This week, according to Carpetbagger Report, he was extremely successful in generating media attention to his and other Democrats' reaction to the GOP attacks:&nbsp; &quot;But I'm amazed how much press Reid's <a href="https://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;ned=us&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;ncl=http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/02/08/reid.bush/">earned this week</a> with his hard-charging fight against the GOP attacks. You don't suppose this has anything to do with <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/003124.html">Reid's new war room</a>, do you?&quot;</li></ul>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Carpetbagger Report finishes with this:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><em>I've said it before and I'll say it again: I may not agree with Reid on
every issue, but I think he's the best Senate Dem leader since LBJ.</em></p></blockquote><p>After less than two months on the job, that is truly high praise.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Via <a href="https://aboutown.blogspot.com/2005/02/tangled-bank-is-here.html">Tangled Bank</a>, a bi-weekly collection of natural science writings in weblogs, and <a title="10,000 Birds - February 2005" href="http://www.10000birds.com/february2005.htm#2/8/05">10,000 Birds</a>, I am reminded that the annual <a href="http://www.birdsource.org/gbbc/">Great Backyard Bird Count</a> is coming up.&nbsp; The weekend after next.&nbsp; It's fun; it's easy; and it's participatory science for amateur bird watchers such as myself.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/pr/GBBC_2005.html">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a>:</p>

<table border="1"><blockquote><p><em>During the weekend of February 18 through 21, people across the North
American continent are encouraged to count the birds in their backyards
and report them over the Internet, as part of the Great Backyard Bird
Count (GBBC), one of the world's largest volunteer efforts of its kind.
In addition to its value as a research study, the GBBC allows people of
all ages and backgrounds to celebrate birds and provide vital
information about North America's birds.</em></p></blockquote></table>

<p>Here are the <a href="http://www.birdsource.org/gbbc/howTo.html">instructions</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>We need every bird enthusiast in North America to count for the birds!</em></p>
<p><em>All you need is basic knowledge of bird identification and access to
the Internet at home, a friend's house, local library, school, or
anywhere you can get access to the Web.<br /><br />
Here's what you do:</em></p>

<ul><li><em><strong>Count the birds</strong> in your backyard,local park, or other natural area on one or all four count days. You can count in as many
different locations as you wish, just make sure to keep separate
records and fill out a checklist for each area.</em></li><br />
<li><em><strong>Watch the birds</strong> for at least 15 minutes on each day that you participate. We recommend watching for a half-hour or more, so that you'll have a good sense of what birds are in your area.</em></li><br />
<li><em><strong>How to count:</strong> Your data will be used by scientists to analyze bird populations, so it is very important that everyone count their birds in exactly the same way. On the day(s) that you count, watch your bird feeders or take a short walk (less than 1 mile) in your neighborhood or park.<br /><br />For each kind (species) of bird that you see, keep track of the </em><em>highest number of individuals that you observe at any one time. Use a &quot;tally sheet&quot; to help keep</em><em> track of your counts. Your tally sheet should look something like the following:</em><br /><br />
<ul><li><em>House Finch - 3, 5, 3, 1</em></li>
<li><em>High Count = 5</em></li>
<li><em>Blue Jay - 1, 3, 6, 2</em></li>
<li><em>High Count = 6</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Be careful not to count the same bird over and over! Don't add
another Blue Jay to your tally every time you see a Blue Jay at the
feeder. </em><em>You could be seeing the same individual again and again.
If you record only the highest number of individual birds that you see
in view at one time, you're sure to never count the same bird more than
once!
</em></p></li>
<li><em>At the end of the day go to &quot;<strong>Submit your bird checklist&quot;</strong> on our GBBC web site. Fill out the questions about your location, local habitat, and count duration. Then enter your high counts for each species sighted on that day and location. You can submit one bird checklist for each day that you count or for each new area that you count in.<br /><br />
For example:</em><br />
<ul><li><em>If you count an four days at one location, you'd submit four different checklists.</em></li>
<li><em>If you count on four days at two different locations each day, submit eight checklists. And so on.</em></li></ul></li><br />
<li><em><strong>Problems getting access to the Internet?</strong> Many libraries, schools, bird clubs, and other community-based groups will be helping, too. If organizations in your area are not already planning to help those without Internet access, you can help get something started!</em></li><br />
<li><em><strong>Finally,</strong> after you've submitted your data, explore our web site. Check our results section to see other reports from your community, and watch as data come in from other areas. Have a look through our other pages, and find out other ways you can help birds.<br /><br />
Enjoy!</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>It's been a few years since we've remembered to participate in this, so we are overdue.&nbsp; Great fun for the whole family.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Following <a href="../../2005/01/rethinking_cali.html">my lead</a> (or so I would like to think), <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_02/005610.php" title="The Washington Monthly">Kevin Drum</a> of the Washington Monthly officially changes his mind on whether to support the governor of California's redistricting reform plan:
</p><blockquote><p><em>I'm in a pickle.&nbsp; I've been feeling guilty ever since my <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005405.php">churlish dismissal</a> of Arnold Schwarzenegger's plan to end gerrymandering in California, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/07/politics/07reform.html?ei=5088&amp;en=988cea7682ac194d&amp;ex=1265432400&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position">yesterday's article in the New York Times</a> on the subject just made me feel worse.&nbsp; The </em><em>Times
reports that anti-gerrymandering efforts are gaining traction across
the nation, and success in California could go a long way toward moving
the cause forward. That seemed like a good opportunity for me to have a
public change of heart about the whole thing.</em></p></blockquote><p>But how do we Democrats make sure that GOP, via Schwarzenegger, doesn't steal the mantle of reform from us?&nbsp; This answer, in my opinion, is that we need to be even more aggressive than Schwarzenegger in pushing this.&nbsp; We can't do so in Congress, since we are in the minority, but there is no reason why Democratic governors cannot do so.&nbsp; And there is especially no reason why Democratic governors in states that are currently gerrymandered to favor the GOP should not do so.</p>

<p>So I propose that it is time for Governor Jennifer Granholm of Michigan and Governor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania to jump on board the redistricting reform bandwagon.&nbsp; Why let Schwarzenegger steal all the headlines?</p>

<p>To help kick-start the reform bandwagon, and also encourage rank-and-file Republicans to join it and truly make it national, Illinois Democrats, who control their entire state government right now, could pull a DeLay and perform a highly partisan re-redistricting themselves, a la Texas 2003.&nbsp; Make Denny Hastert and Henry Hyde sweat.</p>

<p>So how does this sound?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The Los Angeles Times has an excellent <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-assess8feb08,0,7191816.story?coll=la-home-headlines">story</a> on George &quot;Big Government&quot; Bush's latest budget.&nbsp; Their headline gets the essential point across in six words:</p><blockquote><p><strong>President Putting 'Big' Back in Government</strong></p></blockquote><p>From the article:</p><blockquote><p><em>Bush's $2.57-trillion budget for 2006, if approved by Congress, would
be more than a third bigger than the 2001 budget he inherited four
years ago. It is a monument to how much Republicans' guiding fiscal
philosophy has changed over the 10 years since the GOP's Contract With
America called for a balanced budget and abolition of entire Cabinet
agencies.<br /><br />...</em></p>

<p><em>But many analysts view [Bush's spending-restraint] promises with skepticism because, they
say, Bush in his first term had a disappointing record of confronting
Congress on popular spending programs. He has never vetoed a bill,
making him the first president so restrained since James Garfield, who
was shot to death after less than a year in office.<br /><br /> &quot;This is a
promise in which his position so far is not credible,&quot; said William A.
Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, and
a former economic advisor to President Reagan. &quot;President Bush also
promised to reduce the deficit in half last year, but it went up $15
billion.&quot;<br /><br />...</em></p>

<p><em>Republicans' commitment to eliminating the deficit, a cornerstone of
the Contract With America, also seems a thing of the past. Party
members now argue that the deficit — although it is a record in
absolute numbers — is manageable because, when measured as a share of
the economy, it is not as large as Reagan's 1983 deficit. </em></p>

<p><em> But
Stanley E. Collender, a budget analyst with Financial Dynamics, a
business communications firm in Washington, said that amounted to
&quot;using the budget failure of one Republican to make the large deficits
of another appear to be less troubling.</em></p>

<p><em> &quot;President Bush would never admit this, but he has transformed the party into the party of permanent big deficits,&quot; he said.</em></p></blockquote><p>Actually, perhaps an even better headline for this story would have been:&nbsp; &quot;GOP:&nbsp; The Party of Permanent Big Deficits.&quot;</p>

					<h3 class="entry-header"><a href="../../2005/02/5k.html">5K: A time to beat</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Over the weekend, I ran in an official 5K run for the first time in approximately a decade.&nbsp; Back when I was in graduate school, living in the Los Angeles area, I ran approximately one such race a year.&nbsp; But it's been over eight years now since I left California, and I hadn't run one since.</p>

<p>But that changed Saturday morning.&nbsp; Perhaps needless to say, I'm a bit slower now then I was back then.&nbsp; I ran this race in 24:15.&nbsp; Back in my L.A. era, I recall that I generally ran then in 21 minutes or so.&nbsp; (Except for a brutally hilly course at Pepperdine University in Malibu that pushed my time above 24 minutes.)&nbsp; And before that, in 1989 when I was in college in Chicago, I once ran one in 18:48.&nbsp; It wasn't a fluke, as a year later in Houston I ran a 5K in just over 19 minutes (19:03, as I recall).</p>

<p>My 24:15 gives me a goal to beat next time around, though, and hopefully will give me an incentive to exercise more regularly.&nbsp; That's my real goal in this, after all.&nbsp; Getting decent times in races is the only way I've ever been able to maintain an interest in running for exercise.</p>

<p>The race results are posted <a href="http://www.chshel.org/runwalkresults.htm">here</a>.&nbsp; Alas, I have been disappeared from the list!&nbsp; In retrospect, I think they gave me the wrong number when I signed up, and so my finishing time was recorded as someone else's.&nbsp; They do have another participant listed at 24:15, and I'm pretty sure I didn't finish within a couple seconds of anyone else.&nbsp; Based on that table, I was around the 73rd finisher out of approximately 330.&nbsp; That's better than I figured, since I started out the first half-mile or so faster than I should have, and spent the rest of the race continually hearing the footsteps of those overtaking me, including a few fellows who looked to be twice my age.</p>

<p>If this were some parallel universe where I had been able to match my times from 1989-1990, I would have finished in twelfth place.&nbsp; I guess I was pretty fast once upon a time even though I didn't have any training discipline back then either.</p>

<p>I think I'll try again in a month or so, and hopefully can break 24 minutes.</p>

				<p>The New York Times published an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/07/opinion/07behe.html">op-ed</a> from perhaps the most prominent proponent of the &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; theory, Michael Behe.&nbsp; Unfortunately, but predictably, it turns out to be a very misleading, if not outright deceptive, as biologist PZ Myers points out at <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/behe_jumps_the_shark/">Pharyngula</a>.</p>

<p>I read Behe's article before I read Myers' response, and I, too, found it sneakily deceptive, despite coming at it from my layman's perspective.&nbsp; But Behe's style may be sufficient to confuse and mislead many people who are not familiar with the evolution versus intelligent design debate.</p>

<p>PZ Myers' response should therefore be as widely read as Behe's article, and I hope the Times sees fit to print a full-length op-ed piece—not just a letter-to-the-editor—from a biologist such as Myers in the coming days.</p>

<p>Myers initially points out Behe's empty promise:</p><blockquote><p><em> [Behe] </em><em>claims the Intelligent Design guess is based on physical
evidence, and that he has four lines of argument; you’d expect him to
then succinctly list the evidence, as was done in the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/">29+ Evidences for Macroevolution</a> FAQ on the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/">talkorigins site</a>. He doesn’t. Not once in the entire op-ed does he give a single piece of this “physical evidence.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Later, Myers reveals one of the major deceptions in Behe's piece.&nbsp; Information that the typical reader, including myself, will not have:</p><blockquote><p><em>The rest of his argument consists of citing a number of instances of
biologists using the word “machine” to refer to the workings of a cell.
This is ludicrous; he’s playing a game with words, assuming that
everyone will automatically link the word “machine” to “design.” But of
course, Crick and Alberts and the other scientists who compared the
mechanism of the cell to an intricate machine were making no
presumption of design.</em></p>

<p><em>There is another sneaky bit of dishonesty here; Behe is trying to
use the good names of Crick and Alberts to endorse his crackpot theory,
when the creationists know full well that <a href="http://www.designinference.com/documents/02.02.POISK_article.htm">Crick did not believe in ID</a>, and that <a href="http://www.cellbioed.org/articles/vol3no2/article.cfm?articleID=98">Alberts has been vocal in his opposition</a>.</em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Later, Myers writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>Look at what he is doing: he is simply declaring that there is no
convincing explanation in biology that doesn’t require intelligent
design, therefore Intelligent Design creationism is true. But thousands
of biologists think the large body of evidence in the scientific
literature </em>is<em> convincing! Behe doesn’t get to just wave his
hands and have all the evidence for evolutionary biology magically
disappear; he is trusting that his audience, lacking any knowledge of
biology, will simply believe him</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, he concludes by boiling down Behe's essay into its essential form:</p><blockquote><p><em>Behe began this op-ed by telling us that he was going to give us the
contemporary argument for Intelligent Design creationism, consisting of
four linked claims. Here’s a shorter Behe for you:</em></p>

<p><em><strong>The evidence for Intelligent Design.</strong></em></p>

<ol><li><em>It’s obvious.</em></li>

<li><em>It’s obvious!</em></li>

<li><em>Evolutionary explanations are no good.</em></li>

<li><em>There aren’t any good evolutionary explanations.</em></li></ol>

<p><em>That’s it.</em></p>

<p><em>That’s pathetic.</em></p>

<p><em>And it’s in the New York Times? Journalism has fallen on very hard times.</em></p></blockquote><p>Let's see if the Times comes through by giving space to a proper couter-argument in the next few days.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Via <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004873.html#004873">Off the Kuff</a>, I found a new site called <a href="http://www.texasblogs.net/">Texas Bloggers</a>.&nbsp; It's apparently a group blog where any Texas blogger can sign up and post.&nbsp; A community of bloggers.&nbsp; Sounds like a great idea to both find out about other blogs in our state (besides the semi-famous ones like Off the Kuff, of course) and to publicize my own blog a little bit.&nbsp; So I just signed up.</p>

<p>Right now, including myself, there are six San Antonio blogs listed.&nbsp; Politically, they appear to be a mixed bag.&nbsp; I've perused each of them briefly.</p>

<p><strong>B and B</strong>:&nbsp; Yours truly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dagney007.blogspot.com/"><strong>dagney's rant</strong></a>:&nbsp; Pro-Bush conservative.&nbsp; Reading list contains entries like &quot;GOP Bloggers,&quot; &quot;The Glenn Beck Show,&quot; &quot;Blogs for Bush,&quot; &quot;The Conservative Cat,&quot; etc.&nbsp; Recent posts have titles like &quot;Proud of My President,&quot; and &quot;Shillary the Chamaeleon = Warning!&quot;&nbsp; Here is his mission statement, posted at the top of his site, right under the title:</p><blockquote><p><em>This is where I will put my upsets, resentments, reasonings and logical
commentary on why liberalism is a threat to the United States of
America! Dagney Taggert is a character from Ayn Rand's &quot;Atlas
Shrugged&quot;, but she was also my teacher. She taught me the fallacy of my
liberal upbringing. If you are a liberal, you may see some of the
fallacy of it here, too...unless you're braindead!</em></p></blockquote><p>Yikes!&nbsp; Looks like we're not going to agree on much.<br /><strong><br /><a href="https://expressnewswatch.blogspot.com/">S. A. Express-News Watch</a> </strong>:&nbsp; His mission statement:</p><blockquote><p><em>Welcome to Express-News Watch, where I shine the light of truth and
justice on the liberal bias of my hometown &quot;newspaper,&quot; the San Antonio
Express-News.</em></p></blockquote><p>Uh, the Express-News endorsed Bush in two out of the last two Presidential elections.&nbsp; So this is looking like another one I'm not going to agree with very often.</p>

<p><a href="https://cernigsnewshog.blogspot.com/"><strong>NewsHog</strong></a>:&nbsp; This is more like it.&nbsp; Three contibutors, one of whom (&quot;Mr. M&quot;) has this statement in his profile:</p><blockquote><p><em>Born and raised in California and displaced to Virginia, I'm the
original Red State Liberal, fighting the good fight, trying to open the
eyes of the sheep to the beauty of TRUE democracy, and TRUE patriotism.
Swinging from left field deep in the heart of the Reality Based
Community, I'm on a mission to help all the other Red State Liberals
stand their ground and begin the long hard fight of turning some of
those red states blue.
Mr. M</em></p></blockquote><p>Wait!&nbsp; He's not in San Antonio, or even Texas.&nbsp; I guess one of the other contributors is a Texan (perhaps &quot;Cernig,&quot; who appears to have created the blog, based on its URL).&nbsp; The blogroll for this site includes left-leaning sites such as &quot;AlterNet,&quot; &quot;Donkey Rising,&quot; &quot;Left of Center,&quot; &quot;Political Animal,&quot; &quot;The Left Coaster,&quot; and more.<br /><a href="https://www.rhetoricrhythm.blogspot.com/"><strong><br />Rhetoric &amp; Rhythm</strong></a>:&nbsp; Another fellow Democrat, apparently.&nbsp; The author is a 38-year old editor at a &quot;weekly business paper.&quot;&nbsp; Recent post titles include:&nbsp; &quot;Bush's aid promises falling short,&quot; &quot;Another liberal voice silenced,&quot; and &quot;Second Term Curse.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.arellis.net/online_journal.html">Roscoe Ellis</a></strong>:&nbsp; His posts, at least based on a quick glance, look more personal than political.&nbsp; But he doesn't appear to be a big fan of Hillary Clinton, with one post entitled &quot;Struck Down by God?&quot; about Clinton's recent on-stage collapse.</p>

<p>So with my addition, it's roughly an even split for San Antonio for the time being.&nbsp; Later I'll have to peruse the blogs from the rest of the state.</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The <a title="Bull Moose" href="http://www.bullmooseblog.com/2005/02/wednesday-afternoon-massacre.html">Bull Moose</a> informs us about the Hastert/DeLay purge of the House Ethics Committee that happened last night, while everyone else was distracted by the State of the Union speech:</p><blockquote><p><strong><span class="headline">Wednesday Afternoon Massacre</span>
</strong><span class="copy"><br /><br />The Delayicans' purge does not escape the notice of the Moose.
<br />
<br />Employing the cloak of the State of the Union Address, the House
Republicans instituted a purge yesterday on the House Ethics Committee
to protect their Chief Bug Man. Apparently, it was three strikes and
Ethics panel Chief Joel Hefley was out after repeatedly scolding DeLay
for violating the rules of the chamber.
<br />
<br />The Washington Post<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58884-2005Feb2.html"> reports</a>,
<br />
<br /><em>&quot;Rep. Joel Hefley (R-Colo.), who clashed with DeLay so often
that they barely spoke and was considered wayward by other leaders, was
replaced yesterday with Rep. Richard Hastings (R-Wash.). Hastings has
carried out other sensitive leadership assignments and is known as a
favorite of Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), who made the decision.&quot;
</em>
<br /><em></em>
<br />The very same chamber where the President eloquently hailed the
virtues of freedom was the site where Republicans were replacing the
rule of law with the rule of the Bugman! And those very brave
Republicans had the audacity to display their ink stained fingers as if
they had risked all to defend the virtues of democracy! Why these
courageous warriors would walk across a field of land mines to get a
campaign check from a K Street lobbyist.
<br />
<br />Have they no shame?
<br />
<br />In addition to the Hefley purge, the democracy-loving Delayicans
put two cronies of their Majority Leader on the Ethics Committee,
<br />
<br /><em>&quot;Republican leaders put on the committee two new members who
have donated to a DeLay legal fund: Rep. Lamar S. Smith (R-Tex..) and
Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.). Smith gave DeLay $10,000, making him among the
seven largest donors among congressional members, and Cole gave $5,000,
according to an analysis of disclosure records by the watchdog group
Public Citizen. &quot;</em>
<br /><em></em>
<br />It would be ironic indeed if the future Iraqi parliament is less
corrupt than our GOP dominated crony operated House of Representatives.
And this latest act does give new meaning to the term &quot;lower chamber.&quot;
</span></p></blockquote><p>Josh Marshall has <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_01_30.php#004649">more</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Timed as it was to get lost in the hullabaloo of the State of the
Union address, the Tuesday night/Wednesday morning purge of the House
Ethics Committee was still a pretty audacious move.</p>

<p>It's been known for some time that the now-outgoing Chairman of the House <a href="http://www.house.gov/ethics/">Ethics Committee</a>, Rep. <a href="http://www.house.gov/hefley/">Joel Hefley</a> (R) of Colorado was <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2005_01_02.php#004353">going to get canned</a> for his various offenses related to the Ethics Committee's handling, be it ever so gentle, of Rep. <a href="http://tomdelay.house.gov/">Tom DeLay</a> (R) of Texas.&nbsp; The only mystery was just when the ax would fall.

</p>

<p>But in this case, Speaker Hastert seemed to be channeling Michael Corleone in one of his less appealing moments.</p>

<p>As we <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_11_14.php#004061">noted</a>
back on November 19th, three of the five Republican members of the
House Ethics Committee turned out to be in the Shays Handful. Or
putting it more prosaically, three of them voted <em>against</em> the DeLay Rule.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The three were Hefley, Rep. <a href="http://hulshof.house.gov/">Kenny Hulshof</a> (R) of Missouri and Rep. <a href="http://www.house.gov/latourette/">Steven LaTourette</a> (R) of Ohio.</p>

<p>Hastert axed all three.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The two who toed the DeLay line -- Rep. <a href="http://judybiggert.house.gov/">Judy Biggert</a> (R) of Illinois and Rep. <a href="http://www.house.gov/hastings/">Doc Hastings</a> (R) of Washington -- stay.&nbsp; And Hastings becomes Chairman.&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>As you may recall, the &quot;DeLay Rule&quot; was the rule that the GOP tried to institute to make sure Tom DeLay would be able to remain in the GOP leadership if he were to be indicted for campaign finance law violations in Texas.&nbsp; The GOP backed off that rule last month, but managed to <a href="../../2005/01/the_real_story_.html">gut the House ethics rules</a> in the process.&nbsp; DeLay and his associates are making the House an Ethics Free Zone, at least for themselves, for the next congress.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>At long last, a reporter finally decides to talk to a significant number of female scientists to find out what they think about the Harvard President's comments from a couple weeks ago.&nbsp; From the <a title="Harvard president under microscope / Female scientists debate comments on gender, science" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2005/01/31/MNG02B326R1.DTL&amp;type=printable">San Francisco Chronicle</a> yesterday:</p><blockquote><p><em>To many female scientists, whose ancestors were denied admittance 
not only to Ivy League colleges but also to laboratories, a recent speech by 
Harvard President Lawrence Summers was a blast from the past&nbsp; --&nbsp; a reminder 
of dimwitted prejudices many women hoped they had outlived. 
</em></p>

<p><em>Exactly what Summers said in his mid-January remarks on the 
underrepresentation of women in science is uncertain, as he has reportedly 
declined to release a tape of the remarks and no transcript has been made 
public. What is known is that he claimed that girls are less likely than boys 
to get the highest scores in standardized math and science tests, and that he 
suggested several explanations.
</em></p>

<p><em>Among those possible explanations, he said, was that the differences are 
innate&nbsp; --&nbsp; that is to say, genetic. Angered, a noted MIT female biologist 
walked out on the speech. Summers later issued an apology, stating: &quot;I deeply 
regret the impact of my comments and apologize for not having weighed them 
more carefully.&quot;
</em></p>

<p><em>Still, his original remarks rankle many female&nbsp; --&nbsp; and not a few male scientists, a few of whom suggest Summers should be fired.</em></p>

<p><em>A leading female astrophysicist at Yale, Meg Urry, says she and her 
female colleagues in science &quot;have talked of little else for days.&quot; In the Bay 
Area, members of the East Bay chapter of the Association for Women in Science 
&quot;discussed this around the table&quot; at their latest meeting, says their chapter 
secretary, Paula Shadle.
</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;The reaction was frustration, disappointment, and no surprise,&quot; said 
Shadle, a quality assurance consultant to the pharmaceutical industry who has 
a doctorate in biochemistry from UC San Diego. &quot;One person said, 'Maybe this 
attitude explains why Harvard hasn't been able to attract women.' &quot; 
</em></p>

<p><em>Critics say Summers ignored overwhelming evidence that such difficulties 
are caused by social factors that include sex discrimination, not by genetics. 
They note that boys' and girls' average test scores are the same, and that 
gender differences in scores have converged over the past few decades&nbsp; --&nbsp; a 
convergence that no one suggests is due to a sudden transmutation of women's DNA.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>Some women say Summers' speech also shows he's insensitive to the history 
of sex discrimination against female scientists.
</em></p>

<p><em>Helen Quinn, now a top physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator 
Center, said that in the 1960s she met a young man who asked what she did for 
a living. On being told, he said, &quot;That's not my idea of what a woman ought to 
be,&quot; and walked away. 
</em></p>

<p><em>Margaret Burbidge&nbsp; --&nbsp; one of the most distinguished astrophysicists of the past half-century, now a professor emeritus at UC San Diego&nbsp; --&nbsp; recalled 
how, as a young woman, she applied for a fellowship to observe the stars using 
the telescopes atop Mount Wilson in Southern California. She was informed 
&quot;that women were not allowed at Mount Wilson Observatory.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>The next question, some women say, is: What is the most constructive way 
to react to Summers' speech? Here, an informal sampling of female scientists 
uncovered significant disagreement.
</em></p>

<p><em>Suford Lewis, a 1965 graduate of Harvard who is now president of the 
Association for Women in Computing, is disturbed that during Summers' speech, 
&quot;at least one (woman present) felt ill, got up and left. Instead of getting 
angry and leaving, we should get angry and fight. I find a humorous remark to 
be the best weapon.&quot;
</em></p>

<p><em>Barrie Greene, a Harvard physics graduate who earned her doctorate in 
biochemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1995 and now 
works as a patent agent, thinks some women have overreacted to the whole 
brouhaha. She was &quot;surprised and distressed to hear women scientists claim 
they were offended and even physically sickened by an opinion they disagreed 
with. This does not help to debunk stereotypes of women as emotional and 
incapable of cool logic,&quot; said Greene, a member of the Palo Alto chapter of 
the Association for Women in Science. 
</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;It is important to note that Summers was not saying that women 
scientists are inferior to men,&quot; Greene continued. &quot;Rather, he was trying to 
discover why fewer women choose to be scientists in the first place. Nor did 
he insist on gender differences in ability and interest as the sole 
explanation, but considered discrimination against women as another possible 
factor.&quot;
</em></p>

<p><em>Nonetheless, Summers &quot;should be fired,&quot; Shadle said, &quot;just as the coach 
who when asked why most coaches were white while most players were black, said,
'Maybe it's genetic.' His published apology is totally inadequate.&quot; 
</em></p>

<p><em>But Burbidge opposes firing him: &quot;Ridicule is the best response!&quot;
</em></p>

<p><em>Meanwhile, sex discrimination in science persists, some women charge.
</em></p>

<p><em>A prominent female scientist on the East Coast who asked not to be 
identified said she has watched in dismay as &quot;inferior male colleagues&quot; were 
given &quot;better lab and office space ... (and) introductions to prominent 
scientists, while women were ignored.&quot;
</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;My concepts and actual work have been stolen and published without 
credit to me, or with only the faintest acknowledgement,&quot; she added.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>Shadle complains that women receive mixed messages: &quot;I personally have 
been told, simultaneously, both that I was too aggressive&nbsp; --&nbsp; and that I was 
'too nice' to be successful as a scientist and lacking in 'that killer 
instinct.' &quot;
</em></p>

<p><em>Some research suggests the media is partly to blame, as it perpetuates 
stereotypical views. Prime-time TV shows tend to depict few scientists who 
aren't white males, according to a 1999 study by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce. 
</em></p>

<p><em>Evolutionary neurobiologist Richard C. Francis, whose book &quot;Why Men Won't 
Ask for Directions&quot; was published in 2003 by Princeton University Press, 
believes sex differences on tests are too diverse globally, and change too 
much over time, to be simplistically attributed to genes. 
</em></p>

<p><em>For example, Francis says, by the 1960s, &quot;the conventional wisdom was 
that males were superior in spatial-mathematical skills and females were 
superior in verbal skills,&quot; although these beliefs were based on &quot;remarkably 
thin&quot; evidence. Today, the putative female advantage in verbal skills &quot;has 
been debunked,&quot; while tests that purportedly showed a male advantage in 
spatial skills &quot;no longer do, with the exception of 3-D mental rotations&quot;&nbsp; --&nbsp; 
the ability to mentally rotate an image in one's mind.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>A leading astrophysicist, Wendy Freedman, director of Carnegie 
Observatories in Pasadena, says one of the most important things parents can 
do is ensure that their daughters receive the same science education as their 
sons: &quot;When my daughter was in the third grade, she came home and said to me, 
'I can't do math.' 
</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;So I told her, 'Sorry, but no daughter of mine is allowed to say that.' 
We looked at her ... problems, (and) she became thrilled to see that she could 
do them.&quot; Eventually she became a top-ranked math student. 
</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Now imagine what might have happened,&quot; Freedman adds, &quot;if I had agreed 
with her, and said, 'Yes, girls intrinsically aren't very good at math.' &quot;
</em></p></blockquote><p>Why has it taken so long to get these opinions of female scientists, with their unique perspective on how biased attitudes have conspired against them, themselves into the news coverage of this story?&nbsp; Instead of stories being focused on whether discrimination exists and what effect it has, most stories have instead focused on the red herring of male-female differences.&nbsp; (For one example, see <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/210143_ecenter01.html">this</a> New York Times article, via the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.)</p>

<p>Thanks to Keay Davidson for writing this new angle, and the San Francisco Chronicle for publishing it.</p>
