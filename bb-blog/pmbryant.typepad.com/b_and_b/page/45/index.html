<p>The first picture was taken from about 10 miles up, from what I understand.&nbsp; It clearly shows drainage patterns.&nbsp; Since Titan is too cold for liquid water, it must be something else.&nbsp; Apparently liquid methane is a likely candidate.&nbsp; As for the dark area on the right, a science correspondent on NPR called it a &quot;shoreline,&quot; suggesting it may be a lake of liquid methane or something.&nbsp; The resolution of the images I've seen are poor, but in some, I see features that look like they may be small craters.&nbsp; If those are real features and not artifacts, then that would obviously rule out any lake, at least in the limited view of this picture.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>From Matthew Yglesias at <a title="TAPPED: January 2005 Archives" href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/archives/2005/01/index.html#005237">TAPPED</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>GERRYMANDERING IN CALIFORNIA.</strong> Last week, <strong>Kevin Drum</strong> said that even though gerrymandering is terrible, California Democrats should <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005405.php">oppose</a> <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong>'s plan to end it in order to preserve partisan advantage. Today, <strong>Peter Beinart</strong> says Democrats <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050124&amp;s=trb012405">should support it</a> in order to set off a national wave of redistricting reform. Today, Kevin says <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005449.php">maybe</a>, but he thinks it's a risky bet because there may well be no reformist wave.

</p>

<p>I think Kevin's premise is off base. The California congressional delegation is 40 percent Republican. That's about what <strong>George W. Bush</strong>
got statewide in 2000 and only a bit below what he won in 2004. The
Democratic legislature simply hasn't implemented a highly partisan
gerrymander in the Golden State. Instead, they've implement a
risk-averse incumbent protection plan that makes it almost impossible
for any CA Democrats to lose their seats, but also almost impossible
for the Democrats to pick up any new ones. That's nice if you're a
member of Congress, but not so nice if you care about liberal politics.
A non-partisan redistricting in California might lead the GOP to pick
up some seats, but it holds out an equal chance of handing more seats
to the Democrats. Since the Democrats are in the minority in Congress
as a whole, that's a good bet for liberals to take even if the
anti-gerrymandering cause doesn't go nationwide. And, of course, it
really <em>would</em> lay the groundwork for a broader reform agenda aimed against the ethical cesspool the GOP has made of Washington.</p></blockquote><p>Looks like I have to rethink my earlier position.&nbsp; The upside to redistricting reform nationwide is far greater than the downside in California.&nbsp; So even if the downside is more likely, it may well still be the wise thing to do.</p>

<p>The current incumbent protection redistricting plan in California is certainly not anything worth defending.&nbsp; It is a disgrace to democracy, as are the redistricting schemes in most other states.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Chicago got a big <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-weatherblog-link,1,7316166.framedurl?coll=chi-news-hed">snowstorm</a> of 9 or 10&quot; over the last couple days.&nbsp; Now I haven't lived in Chicago since 1990, but I did spend the first 21-plus years of my life there, and this strikes me as a sizeable snowstorm for the place.&nbsp; But Chicago Tribune columnist <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/chi-0501070240jan07,1,1833771.column?coll=chi-news-hed" title="Chicago Tribune | Our winters have gone soft, and so have we">Mary Schmich</a> claims that Chicagoans are getting a bit wimpy about snow:</p><blockquote><p><em><span id="text"> Early this week, with a little snow in the forecast,
the former hog butchers to the world started twittering as if we lived
in Tucson.</span><br /><br /><span id="text"> Snow, snow, scary snow was coming! Batten down the parking spots!</span><br /><br /><span id="text">
Shortly before the scary, scary snow started falling, I heard a woman
in the supermarket line tell the clerk she was there to stock up on
provisions before the snow hit. Oh please. That's what they do in
Atlanta. In Orlando. In cities that have the winter muscle tone of
squids.</span><br /><br /><span id="text"> In places with real winter--the kind of place this used
to be--people walk 5 miles in the snow to get provisions so they can
brag about it later.</span><br /><br /><span id="text"> But our little patch of global warming has
turned us into winter weaklings. We've had so little snow for so long
that former Olympic shovelers have been reduced to amateurs, their
winter muscle atrophied, their winter gumption gone.</span><br /><br /><span id="text"> Shoveling
once a year is like jogging once a year. It leaves you whimpering and
limping. This is particularly dispiriting to us Sunbelt transplants for
whom winter--the physical demands, the mental focus--required years of
special training.</span><br /><br /><span id="text"> The news reports crowed that this week's
snowstorm was the biggest since January 2002. So? That just goes to
show how wimpy our winters have become.</span><br /><br /><span id="text"> Yes, little children,
sit still while your elders tell you how about those great
backbreaking, character-building snows of yesteryear.</span><br /><br /><span id="text"> Way back
in the last century, kiddos, winter was so nasty that a mayor got
elected because the previous mayor couldn't clear the snow. Winter was
once so bad that not only did it snow up to your ears, it sometimes
stayed up there until May.</span></em><br /><span id="text"><br />...</span><br /><em><br /><span id="text"> We pretend to like the pampering, but in our hearts
Chicagoans are uneasy with winter ease. This city stakes its reputation
on its brawn. It didn't get those big shoulders by lounging around in
bikinis. It got them from trudging through snow. From slipping on ice.
From scraping, defrosting and shoveling.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>Now I definitely find the idea that Chicagoans could be starting to resemble Texans about snow to be very unsettling.&nbsp; Fortunately, though, I don't think it's true.&nbsp; </p>

<p>First of all, the only real evidence Schmich presents is the comments of an anonymous woman in a supermaket, and I wouldn't be surprised if this woman was indeed a transplant from Atlanta or Orlando, or perhaps even my new home town of San Antonio.</p>

<p>Second, while Chicago snow has been somewhat less abundant than the long-term average for last few years, this is nothing unusual for Chicago.&nbsp; In fact, based on this <a href="http://home.att.net/~chicago_climo/CHISOW.gif">chart</a> at this <a href="http://home.att.net/~chicago_climo/">website</a>, it is the huge snow years of the 1970s that were the true anomaly.&nbsp; An anomaly that has strongly colored all Chicagoans' memories, especially those of us who grew up there during that period, but still an anomaly.</p>

<p><a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/chisow_2.gif" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=720,height=542,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img width="350" height="263" border="0" alt="Chisow_2" title="Chisow_2" src="../../images/chisow_2.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>The pattern of snowfall amounts over the last 20 Chicago winters greatly resembles the pattern of the 73 winters from 1885-86 through 1957-58, with most years having somewhat less than &quot;average&quot; snow, with the occasional very snowy year thrown in.&nbsp; From 1958-59 through 1984-85, Chicago had an abnormally snowy period.</p>

<p>The late 1970s really stands out, with the two snowiest years on record, by far, coming back to back, in 1977-78 and 1978-79.&nbsp; These are the snowy years Schmich refers to, &quot;way back in the last century.&quot;&nbsp; (Poor Mayor <a href="http://www.weathernotebook.org/transcripts/1999/03/02.html">Michael Bilandic</a> didn't have a chance of getting all those record amounts of snow cleared and subsequently lost the 1979 Mayor's race to Jane Byrne.)&nbsp; I remember those years very well, and for a 10-year old kid like myself, it was great fun to play in the huge snowdrifts, and to clamber over them as I walked back-and-forth to school (uphill both ways, of course).&nbsp; </p>

<p>By my college years in the late 1980s, I was lamenting the relative lack of snow myself.&nbsp; Alas, I didn't realize that those late 1980s years were much more &quot;normal&quot; for Chicago than what I grew up with in the 1970s.</p>

<p>So, unless pre-1958 Chicagoans were soft about snow, I see no reason to fear 21st Century Chicagoans becoming so.</p>

				<p>Bush's nomination of Alberto Gonzalez to be our next Attorney General has brought the subject of Americans torturing terrorist suspect back into the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/06/politics/07gonzalezcnd.html?ei=5094&amp;en=e1ca8de5de25c484&amp;hp=&amp;ex=1105074000&amp;partner=homepage&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position=">news</a>.&nbsp; <a title="Hullabaloo" href="https://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2005_01_02_digbysblog_archive.html#110504940721208844">Digby</a> has an excellent post on this:</p><blockquote><p><em>Every person alive in America today grew up with the belief that
torture is wrong. Popular culture, religion, folklore and every other
form of cultural instruction for decades in this country has taught
that it is wrong, from sermons and lectures to films about slavery to
photographs of Auschwitz to crime shows about serial killers. It is
embedded in our consciousness. We teach our children that it is wrong
to torture animals and other kids. We don't say that there are
exceptions for when the animals or kids are really, really bad. We have
laws on the books that outright outlaw it. The words &quot;cruel and
unusual&quot; are written into our constitution. <br /><br />The problem is not
that there isn't a widely accepted admonition not to conduct torture,
it's that many people, as with all crimes, will choose to ignore the
admonition under certain circumstances. However, that does not mean
that they do not know that what they are doing is wrong. There is
nothing surprising in that. It's why we have laws.<br /><br />The arguments for torture being raised by the right are <em>rationalizations</em>
for what they know is immoral and illegal conduct. Their discomfort
with the subject clearly indicates that they don't really want to
defend it. (Witness the pathetic dance that even that S&amp;M freak
Rush Limbaugh had to do after his comments were widely disseminated.)
Will they admit that they know it's wrong? Of course not. But when they
take up their manly jihad and accuse the Democrats of being swooning
schoolgirls they will also be forced to <span style="font-style: italic;">positively defend</span>
something that many of them know very well is indefensible. And every
time they do that their credibility on values and morals is chipped
away a little bit. <br /><br />I don't expect them to change their tune.
Way too much of this comes from a defect in temperament and garden
variety racism and that's not going to go away. But Democrats have to
thicken their skins and be prepared for the usual attacks and insist
over and over again that it is against the values and principles of the
United States to torture people, period. It is not only right, it is
smart. <br /><br />As I wrote below, the opposition will bluster and
fidget and scream bloody murder. But listen to the tenor of their
arguments. The WSJ [Wall Street Journal] article below rails against the &quot;glib abuse of the
word&quot; as if they can run away from the issue by engaging in a game of
semantics. They are reduced to claiming that unless we torture it will
be unilateral disarmament. We, the most powerful military force the
world has ever known, will be defeated by a bunch of third world
religious misfits if we don't engage in torturing suspects. Just who
sounds weak?</em></p></blockquote>

				<p>Southern California resident and Washington Monthly blogger <a title="The Washington Monthly" href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_01/005405.php">Kevin Drum</a> writes that he is depressed.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because he is forced to oppose a California policy initiative that actually is a good idea, if it were implemented in more states than just California:&nbsp; gerrymandering reform and term limit increases.

</p><blockquote><p><em>After watching Texas Republicans ram through a brutally gerrymandered mid-decade redistricting that gained the Republican party four congressional seats in the 2004 election, how stupid would a California Democrat have to be to agree to meekly support a goo-goo proposal that would have the effect of giving Republicans more seats in yet another state?<br /><br />...<br /><br />So as much as I hate myself for this, count me out. Gerrymandering is a national problem, and it ought to be dealt with nationally so that both blue states and red states are affected equally.</em></p></blockquote><p>I don't live in California any more, but count me out too.&nbsp; Gerrymandering desperately needs to be fixed.&nbsp; But we're not suckers.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/cs-050104sandberg,1,5012824.story?coll=chi-news-hed">Congratulations</a> to one of my all-time favorite baseball players.</p><blockquote><p><em><span id="text"> Ryne Sandberg, the slick-fielding second baseman who
holds the all-time record for homers at the position, was elected
Tuesday to the Baseball Hall of Fame, making the cutoff by just six
votes.</span><br /><span id="text">&nbsp;</span><br /><span id="text">
In his third year on the ballot, Sandberg was picked by 393 voters. He
appeared on 76.2 percent of ballots, just above the 75 percent cutoff
(387). Sandberg received 49.2 percent of votes in 2003 and got 61.1
percent last year, falling 71 votes short.</span><br /><span id="text">&nbsp;</span><br /><span id="text">
&quot;There's been some tremendous, tremendous players who waited longer
than I had to wait to get into the Hall of Fame,&quot; Sandberg said. &quot;I
think defense had everything to do with me getting into the Hall of
Fame.&quot;</span><br /><span id="text">&nbsp;</span><br /><span id="text">
Third baseman Wade Boggs was the only other player elected. Boggs, a
five-time American League batting champion for the Boston Red Sox, was
selected by 474 of the record 516 voters who are 10-year members of the
Baseball Writers' Association of America.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>My interest in baseball has dropped precipitously in the last five years.&nbsp; But once upon a time (and likely, once again sometime in the future) I was a huge fan.&nbsp; I grew up on the Chicago Cubs in the late 1970s and 1980s.&nbsp; The 1984 and 1989 seasons, the Cubs' first division titles and playoff appearances since the 1940s, and Sandberg's prodigious contributions to them, will live forever in my memory.</p>

				<p>From today's headlines:</P>

<p>Every single one of these headlines appears to have missed the larger story here.&nbsp; Some of these stories missed it entirely.&nbsp; Here it is, buried deep in the New York Times article:</p><blockquote><p><em>The proposals would make it harder to proceed with an ethics
investigation by requiring a majority vote of the evenly divided ethics
committee. The current system allows an investigation to begin
automatically if there is no action within 45 days.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.gregsopinion.com/archives/005429.html#005429">Greg Wythe</a> has more about this (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p><em>[The retreat on the DeLay rule change is s]imply a cover for the bad news that still exists in the rules changes. Louise Slaughter's office has the details ...</em></p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;The tactics of Mr. DeLay and his Republicans may have
changed on this, but the goal is the same: to repeal important reforms,
hopelessly cripple the Ethics process and end the prospect of any
accountability in this House on matters of ethics and integrity. This
is wholly unacceptable.&quot;
</em></p>

<p><em>&quot; This package represents a very serious and grave threat to the
credibility and integrity of this institution. And sadly, is being
forced upon the Congress and the American people for the benefit and
protection on one man, Tom DeLay.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;The Republican Party has already gone to extraordinary lengths to
cover for and protect Mr. Delay from his long pattern of unethical
behavior. Now they are changing standing rules of the House to gut the
ethics process, a shameful business for the Majority to be involved in.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>The provision, which will effectively destroy the ethics process in the House does the following:</em><br />
</p>

<ul><li><em> Creates a rule that would dismiss any complaint the evenly split,
bi-partisan Ethics Committee deadlocks on. This measure provides an
effective 'veto' for the Majority over any ethics complaint filed. The
current language places the item into an automatic investigative
subcommittee if agreement cannot be reached in the allotted time frame.</em>

<p></p>

<p></p></li>

<li><em> A change in the rules that would eliminate the 45-day<br />
deadline for action by the Ethics Committee on any complaint before<br />
them. This change would enable the committee to &quot;bury&quot; politically<br />
sensitive ethics complaints indefinitely. This important reform the<br />
Republicans want to dismantle was created in the interest of providing<br />
timely resolutions to ethics complaints before the committee.</em><br /><br />
</li></ul>

<p></p>

<p><em>
The GOP rules change allows a simple majority to pull the plug on
ethics complaints before the Committee has a chance to find out what
the facts of the case are. Under the current Ethics process, a validly
filed complaint automatically moves forward in the Ethics process
unless a bipartisan majority takes action on it within 45 days. This
rules change is the equivalent of allowing a judge to throw out a
meritorious case before it reaches the discovery process. </em></p>

<p><em>
One-half of the Committee will now have the power to &quot;bury&quot; complaints
such as those recently filed against Majority Leader Tom DeLay. The
current Ethics investigation process allows valid cases to move forward
even if the Committee does not act. Under the new rule, after 45 days,
a complaint only moves forward with a majority vote, which means five
members of one party on the Ethics Committee will now have the power to
block meritorious complaints against Members of their party. </em></p>

<p><strong><em>The change effectively ends the process of accountability for the
Ethics Committee by removing any deadline for action, which motivates
the committee to find common ground on sensitive complaints before the
committee.</em></strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>What's more, DeLay and the GOP appear to be on the verge of replacing the current chair of the Ethic Committee, Joel Hefley (R-Colorado), because he has been too independent.&nbsp; Not only did he head up the investigation into DeLay last year, but the New York Times article above mentions that he is one of the few Republicans critical of the proposed new changes to the House ethics rules:&nbsp; &quot;At least one prominent Republican, outgoing ethics committee chairman
Joel Hefley, R-Col., voiced concerns about the rules changes because
``ethics reform must be bipartisan and this package is not bipartisan.'' &quot;&nbsp; </p>

				<p>Anyone looking for a good book to read should take a look at the recently published &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0805071458/qid=1104275255/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/002-2205373-7376840?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846">Arc of Justice</a>&quot; by Kevin Boyle.&nbsp; I read it on a whim, and was blown away.&nbsp; I was inspired for only the second time to write a review at Amazon.com.&nbsp; (The first time was for an excellent book called &quot;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0716737116/qid=1104275723/sr=2-2/ref=pd_ka_b_2_2/002-2205373-7376840">Parallax</a>,&quot; by Alan Hirshfeld—another historical book, but about a scientific race amongst 19th Century astronomers.)</p>

<p>&quot;Arc of Justice&quot; is about the unfortunate events surrounding the attempt by an African American, Dr. Ossian Sweet, and his family to move into a white neighborhood in the booming city of Detroit in the late summer of 1925.&nbsp; For those who don't know anything else about this story, I won't give anything else away.&nbsp; I didn't know anything about the case going in, and so found the book to be extremely suspenseful, quite unlike my experience with any other book about historical events I have ever read.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Boyle's writing brings the characters and the time and place alive.&nbsp; I really felt like I knew what it was like to live in Detroit in 1925.&nbsp; An amazing work.<br /> </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>In the late 1990s, I lived in Hawaii for a few years, including a stretch where we lived at about 10 feet above sea level about 3 blocks from the sea.&nbsp; Hawaii is very <a href="http://www.tsunami.org/">tsunami-aware</a>, from hard experience (in particular, a legendary 1946 tsunami killed over a hundred people), and Hawaii has warning sirens near the coasts in populated areas and has published maps of risk zones and evacuation information in the front of telephone books.&nbsp; &nbsp;Living there, it was impossible not to be aware of the risks.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Sadly, due to the rarity of tsunamis in the Indian Ocean region devastated over the weekend, that does not appear to have been the case in those places.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/28/science/28warn.html?pagewanted=all&amp;position=">New York Times</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>HONOLULU, Dec. 27 - When experts at the Pacific Tsunami Warning
Center in Honolulu were first alerted that an earthquake had struck
Sunday off Indonesia, they had no way of knowing that it had generated
a devastating tsunami and no way to warn the people most likely to
suffer.</em></p>

<p><em>Tsunamis are rare in the Indian Ocean, which has no
system for detecting them and alerting those in danger, and scientists
do not have the tools to tell when an earthquake has created one. </em></p>

<p><em>Not
until the deadly wave hit Sri Lanka and the scientists in Honolulu saw
news reports of the damage there did they recognize what was happening.
</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Then we knew there was something moving across the Indian Ocean,&quot; said Dr. Charles McCreery, the center's director. </em></p>

<p><em>&quot;We
wanted to try to do something, but without a plan in place then, it was
not an effective way to issue a warning, or to have it acted upon,&quot; Dr.
McCreery said. &quot;There would have still been some time - not a lot of
time, but some time - if there was something that could be done in
Madagascar, or on the coast of Africa.&quot; </em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em> The first notice of the earthquake that
anyone at the Pacific tsunami center received was a computer-generated
page set off by seismic sensors at 2:59 p.m. on Saturday Honolulu time.
The immediate message received by people like Laura S. L. Kong, a
Department of Commerce expert who is the head of a United Nations
tsunami education center in Hawaii, included the time of the quake,
latitude, longitude and an initial estimate of magnitude, about 8.0. </em></p>

<p><em>Nobody
was in the office of the Pacific tsunami center. But staff members who
received the pages reached the office, took a closer look at available
data and sent out a warning to a preset list of contacts around the
Pacific. </em></p>

<p><em> The center was advising of sea level changes in Fiji,
Chile and California measured in inches, the echo of a distant event
that had sloshed through the straits that connect the oceans. The
warning center continued to refine its estimate of the quake,
eventually raising it to a magnitude of 9.0, which is 10 times more
powerful than the initial estimate of 8.0, because the scale is
logarithmic.</em></p>

<p><em>The Pacific center, operated by the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, faced two problems in
recognizing what was occurring in the Indian Ocean and alerting
potential victims. There is no direct connection between an earthquake
magnitude and a resulting tsunami. Not all quakes under the ocean lift
the ocean floor to displace the water needed to create a tsunami.</em></p>

<p><em>For
the Pacific, there are computer models to analyze the consequences of
an earthquake, based on years of observations of previous quakes and
tsunamis. For the Indian Ocean, there are no such models, according to
Vasily V. Titov, a research oceanographer with the Oceanographic and
Atmospheric Administration, based in Seattle. &quot;They assemble quite a
bit of data to get the right information and the right warning
message,&quot; he said of such models.</em></p>

<p><em>Another difficulty is that
countries that have experienced tsunamis in recent memory are set up
with warning systems. Hawaii, for example, has warning sirens, and the
&quot;weather radio&quot; network of oceanographic administration can also carry
tsunami warnings. </em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Based
on it being an 8.0, we assumed the damage would be confined to Sumatra
and would be a local tsunami event, one that strikes shore within
minutes of the event,&quot; he said. &quot;We weren't overly concerned at that
point that it was something larger.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em> But using another,
sometimes more accurate method of measuring, Dr. McCreery said, the
staff quickly determined that the magnitude had been closer to 8.5,
more intense, but still only borderline for generating more distant
damage. The center issued a follow-up bulletin.</em></p>

<p><em>But it was not until they saw news reports of casualties in Sri Lanka that all that changed.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>One of the few places in the
Indian Ocean that got the message of the quake was Diego Garcia, a
speck of an island with a United States Navy base, because the Pacific
warning center's contact list includes the Navy. Finding the
appropriate people in Sri Lanka or India was harder.</em></p>

<p><em>The experts
knew they were set up for the wrong ocean, but over a holiday weekend,
Dr. Kong said, &quot;it's tough to find contact information.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/_/2004/12/ifyagotamessageusewesternunion_dept.php">Mark Kleiman</a> comes through with a common-sense suggestion:</p><blockquote><p><em>But if you're an American seismologist and your problem is to get a
tsunami warning to folks in Sri Lanka, India, and Burma within a couple
of hours, surely calling people in those countries and hoping that the
governments will be able to improvise a warning system must be the
wrong way to go. </em></p>

<p><em>Why not call CNN, the Associated Press, and Reuters? They're in the
business of putting out information, and they put it out in a way that
gets directly to senior public officials as well as to lots of ordinary
folks who might live on, or have friends or relatives on, the relevant
coastlines. </em></p>

<p><em>I promise you, a phone call from the International Tsunami
Information Center saying &quot;There's just been a Richter 9.0 quake in
Sumatra and a big tsunami will hit the following places at the
following times&quot; will receive the undivided attention of any newsdesk
in the world. </em></p>

<p><em>If you want to put a system in place, put it in place with the news
organizations, so you have the direct-line phone numbers of the
assignment desks and can send out an authenticated e-mail showing it's
not a hoax. And the media process builds in redundancy; if CNN or AP or
Reuters carries a big, breaking story, the others will have it within
minutes.</em></p>

<p><em>[Or skip all that and just phone it in to Drudge with a hint that
the earthquake was Kerry's fault. That's the fastest way to get a story
out, true or false.]</em></p>

<p><em>Yes, it would be better to have an intergovernmental system in place
as well. But that will take months. The news-media system could be up
and running in a week.</em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>One (slight) problem I see with Kleiman's suggestion is that, without the monitors in place, no one knows for sure if a tsunami has actually been generated, so no one can actually say &quot;a big tsunami <em>will</em> hit the following places.&quot;&nbsp; But still, it seems prudent to use such a system in the meantime, perhaps by issuing alerts like &quot;tsunami watches,&quot; comparable to &quot;tornado watches.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is just a brief sample of the problems with Will's article.&nbsp; Bradley writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>
In a Washington Post Opinion article on December 22, 2004, commentator George Will applauds Michael Crichton’s new book, State of Fear. We have already pointed out some of the more egregious scientific errors in Crichton’s novel ... . Mr. Will compounds those errors and fails his own standards by making statements that are truly “innocent of information but overflowing with certitudes”.<br /><br />Will commits one of the most basic mistakes in examining climate change -- using evidence of cooling from one location to question whether the earth as a whole is warming. (If Mr Will finds that one stock in his portfolio has declined, does this lead him to conclude that his entire portfolio is losing money? For his sake, we hope he takes a more global perspective on his financial affairs than he does on the subject of climate change.)</em> </p></blockquote><p></p>
