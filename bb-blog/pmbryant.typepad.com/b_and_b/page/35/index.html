				<p>San Antonio mayoral candidate Phil Hardberger.&nbsp; <a href="../../2005/05/just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon State Natural Area</a>.&nbsp; What do they have to do with each other?&nbsp; </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=14627672&amp;BRD=2318&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=484045&amp;rfi=6">San Antonio Current</a> spells out Hardberger's small role, back in the 1970s, at the beginning of the long and convoluted process that eventually led to the creation of the state natural area on much of the land that once was scheduled to be part of a huge subdivision of thousands of houses on the outskirts of San Antonio.</p><blockquote><p><em>As a mayoral candidate, Hardberger
recently took credit &quot;for stopping San Antonio Ranch,&quot; but upon further
reflection says he merely jump-started the process. Although he lost
the 1970s lawsuit against the HUD project, the case was the catalyst
for the high level of community interest in the Edwards Aquifer over
the past 30 years.&nbsp; </em></p>



<p><em>&quot;That was a truly huge lawsuit,&quot;
says Hardberger. &quot;This was a planned city of nearly 100,000 people
directly over the Recharge Zone, when very few people understood there
was a recharge zone. It galvanized public opinion to the danger of
polluting the aquifer.&quot;</em></p>

<p>...</p>

<p><em>The development would have proceeded as
planned but for City Planning Director Edward F. Davis, an ardent
environmentalist. He was distressed by a developer-drafted
environmental impact statement's &quot;summary dismissal of potential ill
effects of the SAR on the aquifer,&quot; according to Wattersons' book [The Politics of New Community: A Case Study of San Antonio Ranch].</em></p>

<p><em>After nasty political infighting at the
local, state, and national levels, the League of Women Voters, Citizens
for a Better Environment, a local chapter of the Sierra Club, and the
American Association of University Women sued HUD in federal court and
hired attorney Hardberger to try their case.</em></p></blockquote><p>Hardberger lost the case.&nbsp; But the movement to preserve the land was begun, eventually breaking through in the early 1990s.&nbsp; How much credit does Hardberger deserve?&nbsp; Some, certainly.&nbsp; But many others' contributions were far greater, especially since Hardberger does not appear to have been involved significantly after losing this case.&nbsp; Based on this account, the award for &quot;jump-starting&quot; the process should belong to Edward Davis and the individuals and organizations that initiated the lawsuit, not to their lawyer.</p>

<p>Anyway, I remain undecided about my preferred outcome for tomorrow's mayoral runoff election.&nbsp; If I had a vote, I suspect it would go to Julian Castro, since Hardberger's strong support from the bulk of the cities' entrenched special interests disturbs me.&nbsp; But it is not a strong preference.&nbsp; Hardberger, as shown by his at-times overblown claims about his role in the creation of Government Canyon Sate Natural Area, appears to have his heart in the right place.</p>

				<p>After being offline much of the last few days for various reasons, I return online to discover that the latest carnival of science blogs, <a href="http://tangledbank.net/">Tangled Bank</a>, has been posted, as scheduled, by <a href="http://www.organicmatter.net/node/122">Organic Matter</a>.  Alas, I also discover, quite belatedly, that I cut-and-pasted the wrong link when I submitted my post.  I submitted a brief <a href="../../2005/05/next_generation.html">follow-up</a> post rather than the <a href="../../2005/05/nasa_cutting_sp.html">original</a> version that I intended to.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I will have another chance to cut-and-paste a correct link in a couple weeks for the next Tangled Bank.  Meanwhile, I hope to get a chance to read some of the articles.  Check back later today, as I'll be updating this post with specific references to one or two.</p>

<p>UPDATE (5:00 pm):  Look like that update is going to have to wait.  My troubles getting online are continuing.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Certain readers (at least I hope they are readers) were wondering what former Senator, and recent Vice-Presidential candidate, John Edwards is doing these days.&nbsp; Well, here is the <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/5/31/11221/9907">answer</a>, direct from the man himself, guest-blogging this week over at <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/">Josh Marshall</a>'s brand new community blog, <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/">TPMCafe</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>As many of you may already know, I am directing the new Center on Work,
Poverty, and Opportunity at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.&nbsp; &nbsp;At the Center, we’re focusing on the issues that face the 36
million Americans who are struggling with poverty every day, and
working to examine innovative and practical ideas for moving more
Americans out of poverty and into the middle class.</em></p></blockquote><p>His first post is about a recent <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/metro/pubs/20050404_priceiswrong.htm">study</a> from the Brookings Institution that reveals that low-income families actually pay more for the same services than do high-income families.</p>

<p>Also, here is the link to the <a href="http://www.law.unc.edu/Centers/details.aspx?ID=425&amp;Q=3">Center on Work, Poverty, and Opportunity</a>.&nbsp; At that site, Edwards spells out its mission:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Center brings the best minds in the country together with some of America's
best and brightest young people. We do not pretend to have all the
answers, but I can promise you that we will ask the hard questions:</em></p>

<ul><li><em>How can we restore the promise of America for those living in poverty?</em> 
</li>

<li><em>How can we combat poverty in a way that also honors our core beliefs in hard work, responsibility and family?</em> 
</li>

<li><em>How can we find ways to build more homes and fewer shelters, more small businesses and fewer minimum wage jobs?</em> 
</li>

<li><em>How can we find a way for government and charities and
religious groups to work as more effective partners and honor America's
traditions?</em></li></ul>

<p><em>It may seem like an impossible goal to end poverty, but that's
what the skeptics said about all of the other great challenges we've
faced as a nation. If we can put a man on the moon, conquer polio, and
put libraries of information on a chip, we can end poverty for those
who want to work for a better life. </em></p></blockquote>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Today, the Supreme Court unanimously <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/31/AR2005053100491.html">threw out</a> the three-year old conviction of the Arthur Andersen accounting firm for destroying documents relating to the infamous Enron case.</p><blockquote><p><em>The decision was a major defeat for the Department of Justice, which
prosecuted one of the nation's largest accounting firms against the
advice of numerous critics, who believed the case too weak for criminal
trial.<br /><br />The Andersen firm itself all but disintegrated. Many Andersen
accountants and support staffers scattered to rival companies after
Andersen's criminal conviction. Today, only about 200 employees perform
administrative and legal duties for Andersen, which exists mainly to
fight shareholder lawsuits related to its work for Enron, Global
Crossing Ltd. and other clients.</em></p></blockquote><p>This reminds me of a central paradox of this case that I was curious about several years ago.&nbsp; How can an entity like a corporation be guilty of criminal behavior?&nbsp; Common sense indicates to me that only people can be guilty of criminal behavior.&nbsp; After all, you can't send a corporation to jail for 10 years.&nbsp; The appropriate venue for punishment of illegal organizational behavior would be civil litigation—as well as criminal cases against the individuals involved.</p>

<p>So who at Arthur Andersen was responsible for their shady practices?&nbsp; No doubt many of those who were are now working at different companies—companies that have not been charged with criminal behavior.</p>

<p>Have any individuals been brought to justice in the Arthur Andersen case?&nbsp; </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Bush's air pollution intiative that undermines the Clean Air Act, with its Orwellian name &quot;<a href="../../2005/02/cloudy_skies.html">Clear Skies</a>,&quot;&nbsp; appeared dead in the U.S. Senate <a href="../../2005/03/cloudy_skies_hi.html">earlier this year</a>.&nbsp; But it may have some legislative life after all, at least according to a brief article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/27/politics/27enviro.html">New York Times</a> today:</p><blockquote><p><em>President Bush's moribund air pollution initiative got unexpected life
on Thursday when the Environmental Protection Agency agreed to analyze
competing legislation, satisfying a months-old request from the Senate.</em></p>

<p><em>Efforts by a Senate committee to advance the White House measure,
known as Clear Skies, failed on a 9-to-9 vote in March after Senator
Thomas R. Carper, a Delaware Democrat who voted against it, complained
that the agency had been unwilling to examine his bill and several
others, all of which set tighter emission standards than those in the
administration measure.</em></p>

<p><em>Eight Democrats and one Republican,
Senator Lincoln Chaffee of Rhode Island, voted against the White House
plan while nine Republicans voted for it.</em></p>

<p><em>But in a House
subcommittee hearing on Clear Skies on Thursday, James L. Connaughton,
the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said
the agency had agreed to analyze all the competing bills.</em></p>

<p><em>While
satisfying the request was no assurance that Mr. Carper would support
Mr. Bush's initiative, it could persuade another Democrat, perhaps
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who has been under pressure from
interest groups in his state to support the administration bill, to
change his vote.</em></p></blockquote><p>What are these interest groups in Montana supposedly pressuring <a href="http://www.eande.tv/transcripts/?date=021805">Baucus</a>?&nbsp; A March article by <a href="http://www.cleanairwatch.org/">Clear Air Watch</a>'s <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/a_clear_skies_smokescreen.php">Frank O'Donnell</a> gives us a hint:</p><blockquote><p><em>In a blatant bid to buy Baucus’ vote, [Oklahoma Senator James] Inhofe introduced a new draft of the bill with special privileges for a Montana coal mine.</em></p></blockquote><p>Fortunately, it appears that didn't work, at least by itself, since Baucus hasn't switched his vote.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For more background on this issue, and why 'Clear Skies' is such couterproductive legislation, I strongly recommend reading O'Donnell's full <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/a_clear_skies_smokescreen.php">article</a>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>From the <a href="http://www.statesman.com/news/content/shared/tx/legislature/stories/05/26takings.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> today:</p><blockquote><p><em>There was less than a week left in the 79th
Legislative Session early Wednesday when an exhausted Todd Staples
walked off the Senate floor and said the words that most of Central
Texas' environmentalists and city officials longed for — and some of
its landowners and developers have feared.</em></p>

<p><em>The Republican senator from Palestine said legislation that would
have put a price tag on city environmental regulations was probably
dead.<br /><p>&quot;I think the votes were there to block it,&quot;
Staples, the measure's Senate sponsor, said. &quot;It doesn't look real
promising at this point.&quot;</p>
<p>Yet foes of the measure, House Bill 2833, marked their apparent
victory with dread. While the measure's prospects have dimmed in recent
days — dragged down by a fraying coalition of cities and an unusual
collection of Central Texas power players — no one was ready to bury it.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think you can really call a bill dead until the end of the
session,&quot; said John Hrncir, Austin's government relations officer and a
field general in the battle to kill the proposal.</p></em></p></blockquote><p><p><a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/05/hb-2833-dies.html">Matt</a> reports the news from the <a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/">Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance</a>:</p></p><blockquote><p><em>This
is the last night (broadly speaking now, near 2 a.m.) that House bills
may be heard on the Senate floor on second reading. The Lt. Governor
just announced that the bill they are discussing now, HB 1434, will be
the last bill of the evening; and indeed that bill was just killed on a
point of order since it was after midnight.<br /> </em></p>
<div><em>HB
2833 is dead, unless its language reappears in some other legislation,
and the options for that with time running out at this point are gone
unless the language has already been sneaked into a bill somewhere else
that we haven't caught.</em></div></blockquote><p>Looks like the public interest may have won this round in the battle.&nbsp; Great news.</p>

<p>Stay vigilant, however.</p><blockquote><p><em><span class="cxnshared"><p>But there is no shortage of ways at the
Capitol to resuscitate legislation. Dan Wheelus, a lawyer for the
Landowners' Conservancy who wrote House Bill 2833, said he wasn't ready
to do a postmortem on the proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of talk right now,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation is still somewhat fluid.&quot;</p>
<p>The bill's opponents, meanwhile, are working nearly as hard to keep
it dead as they did to kill it. While Sturzl said the Municipal League
is largely out of the fight, he understood his former comrades'
smoldering concern.</p>
<p>&quot;My motto is: 'Paranoia pays,' &quot; Sturzl said. &quot;I don't ever say
that's over, ever, until they go home. That's the only safe course.&quot;</p></span></em></p></blockquote>

				<p>The fate of the <a href="../../2005/04/yet_more_antilo.html">Taxpayer Extortion Act</a> is apparently coming down to the wire.&nbsp; No action is apparent on the legislature's <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/cgi-bin/db2www/tlo/billhist/actions.d2w/report?LEG=79&amp;SESS=R&amp;CHAMBER=H&amp;BILLTYPE=B&amp;BILLSUFFIX=02833">web site</a>, at least as of 5:50 P.M.&nbsp; But this <a href="http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=180x14999">update and plea</a> from crispini at Democratic Underground early this afternoon indicates last minute maneuvering going on:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Please call on HB2833 TODAY, esp. if you are in CARONA's district!</strong><br /><br />We have heard that the Senators are discussing this bill today.&nbsp; ESPECIALLY IF JOHN CARONA IS YOUR SENATOR, please call him!<br /><br />Please
call John Carona's office at 512-463-0116 and urge him to continue to
oppose HB 2833. Ask him to OPPOSE HB 2833 being heard and voted on
TODAY by the Senate. <br /><br />John heard our many phone calls and
apparently is the crucial 11th vote needed to keep this VERY bad bill
from being voted on by the senate in the last hours of this legislative
session.</em></p></blockquote><p>Carona appears to be a Republican.&nbsp; Will he resist the temptation of going to the dark side on this issue?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/">Voyager 1</a> spacecraft was launched in early September 1977 from Cape Canaveral on a course for the king of the planets, <a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/vgrjup.htm">Jupiter</a>, which it reached on March 5, 1979.&nbsp; It was not the first human probe to fly past that planet—Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 beat it by a few years—--but its dramatic pictures and amazing discoveries, such as the sulfur volcanoes on the satellite Io, captured the public imagination far more so than did the results of those more primitive probes.</p>

<p>

After zooming past Jupiter, Voyager 1 reached <a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/vgrsat.htm">Saturn</a> a year and a half later, on November 12, 1980.&nbsp; The story was similar:&nbsp; more dramatic pictures and amazing discoveries, such as the incomprehensibly complex structure of Saturn's rings.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"><img width="100" height="66" border="0" alt="Saturnvoyager1_1" title="Saturnvoyager1_1" src="../../images/saturnvoyager1_1.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>Voyager 1's course through the Saturn system was designed to give it a close look at the fascinating world Titan, whose thick atmosphere turned out to be opaque to Voyager's cameras, disappointing us armchair explorers at the time but helping lead to the great anticipation of the <a href="../../2005/01/first_pictures_.html">Cassini/Huygens</a> mission that landed a probe on Titan earlier this year.&nbsp; This course past Titan prevented Voyager 1 from following a path onward to the other, at the time still unexplored, giant planets of the outer solar system, <a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/vgrur.htm">Uranus</a> and <a href="http://www.solarviews.com/eng/vgrnep.htm">Neptune</a>.&nbsp; Its sister craft, Voyager 2, was left to study those worlds on its own, flying by them in 1986 and 1989, respectively.&nbsp; And, of course, sending back yet more dramatic pictures and amazing discoveries.

</p>

<p>Instead, Voyager 1 found itself on a lonely, isolated path.&nbsp; No more landmarks on its route.&nbsp; Just a lot of virtually empty space.&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>For nearly 25 years.

</p>

<p>Now, Voyager 1 finally has another landmark to study.&nbsp; There won't be any dramatic pictures, but amazing discoveries are a distinct possibility.&nbsp; Voyager 1 is the first human-made craft to reach the outer edges of the Sun's influence.&nbsp; It is now traversing the boundary zone between the Sun's zone and the interstellar medium itself.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/24/AR2005052401434.html">Washington Post</a>: </p><blockquote><p><em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/24/AR2005052401434.html"><img width="150" height="160" border="0" alt="Washpostvoyager1" title="Washpostvoyager1" src="../../images/washpostvoyager1.gif" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>After a storied, 28-year odyssey, NASA's venerable Voyager 1 spacecraft appears to have reached the edge of the solar system, a turbulent zone of near-nothingness where the solar wind begins to give way to interstellar space in a cosmic cataclysm known as &quot;termination shock,&quot; scientists said yesterday.

<br /><br />&quot;This is an historic step in Voyager's race,&quot; said California Institute of Technology physicist Edward C. Stone, the mission's chief scientist since Voyager 1 and its twin, Voyager 2, were launched in the summer of 1977. &quot;We have a totally new region of space to explore, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em><nitf></nitf><p>Stone said project scientists, working from models of a
phenomenon never before directly observed, finally agreed that data
from Voyager 1's tiny 80-kilobyte computer memory showed that the
spacecraft had passed through termination shock to the &quot;heliosheath,&quot; a
frontier of unknown thickness that defines the border with interstellar
space.</p></em></p>

<p><em><nitf></nitf><p>Stamatios M. Krimigis, another longtime
Voyager scientist, said in an interview that the spacecraft might
remain in the heliosheath for perhaps 10 years but should easily
survive, going dark when its plutonium power source expires around 2020.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>When [Voyager 1] entered the heliosheath, it was 8.7 billion miles away
-- the farthest any manmade object has traveled. Its speed is 46,000
mph.</p></em></p>

<p><em><nitf></nitf><p>Krimigis said the solar wind, made up of
fast-moving electrons, protons and other charged particles, has a
magnetic field that prevents the interstellar wind from breaching the
solar envelope -- known as the &quot;heliosphere&quot; -- as the solar system
travels through space.</p></em></p>

<p><em><nitf></nitf><p>The heliosheath is the
heliosphere's outer frontier, a zone where the solar wind begins to
dissipate. This process begins at termination shock and is marked by a
sudden drop in the speed of the solar wind and a corresponding build-up
in heat and the strength of the magnetic field. The effect is like
traffic piling up on a freeway during rush hour.</p></em></p>

<p><em><nitf></nitf><p>Scientists
first detected these symptoms in 2002, but they receded, then returned
more strongly, only to recede again. It is a script not foreseen by the
computer models.</p></em></p>

<p><em><nitf></nitf><p>&quot;We've gone back and forth since
then,&quot; Krimigis said. &quot;But this time I guess we all agree.&quot; This is
because the magnetic field jumped by a factor of 2.5 to 4 around Dec.
15 -- and has remained fluctuating at a high level since then, Krimigis
said. Scientists estimated that the speed of the solar wind dropped
from 1.5 million mph to near zero.</p></em></p>

</blockquote><p>But wait, there's more.</p><blockquote><p><em><nitf></nitf><p>Of far greater concern to scientists [than the spacecraft's long-term functionality] is the possibility that
NASA could kill the $4.2 million-a-year project to free up money for
President Bush's initiative to send humans back to the moon and
eventually to Mars.</p></em></p>

<p><em><nitf></nitf><p>NASA has put Voyager's fate on
hold while independent reviewers evaluate the mission, with a decision
expected in February. &quot;We're very excited,&quot; Krimigis said of the latest
findings. &quot;We hope NASA will reconsider, and we're confident they will.&quot;</p></em></p></blockquote><p>I, too, am confident that NASA will not, in the end, pull the plug on Voyager, after decades of waiting, just as it reaches the cusp of interestellar space.&nbsp; It is quite cheap at this stage in its life.&nbsp; And it has a huge following of space buffs such as myself who followed its exploits back in our younger days.&nbsp; But that such an action was even being considered is not a good indication of the quality of recent decision-making at NASA headquarters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, onward to the stars, Voyager.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Cernig at <a href="https://cernigsnewshog.blogspot.com/2005/05/kindergarten-politics.html">NewsHog</a> proposes a solution to the battle over judicial nominations in the United States Senate:</p><blockquote><p><em>
You know I am one of those &quot;damn furriners&quot;, right? So I speak from total ignorance, that's a given.<br /><br />So can someone explain to me why the obvious solution to all the kindergarten name-calling hasn't been proposed? <br /><br />...<br /><br />How about just introducing term limits for Supreme Court judges? That
way no-one can pack the judiciary with their own ideological allies for
a generation. Both sides say that's something to avoid, don't they? So
then there's no problem with always giving an up-or-down vote. Both
sides agree that's the best possible way for democracy to work, don't
they?<br /><br />There, problem solved, can you all run along and play nice now?</em></p></blockquote><p>Alas, this isn't much of a solution.&nbsp; If the GOP were interested in being reasonable and responsible about
judicial nominations, there would be no fight in the first place.</p>

<p>Enacting this proposal would require a constitutional amendment, therefore requiring support from a 2/3 vote in both houses of Congress, as well as from 3/4 of all the state legislatures.&nbsp; Since the GOP is not interested in anything short of the ability to put every single person on the courts that they desire for as long as possible, this simply will not happen.</p>

<p>The GOP used arcane senate rules to block dozens of Clinton's judicial
nominees in the late 1990s, then changed those rules to prevent
Democrats from using them to block Bush's extreme choices, yet they
still want more.&nbsp; The vast majority of Bush's judicial nominees have been approved, yet they still want more.&nbsp; The Supreme Court already consists of seven Republicans versus two Democrats, yet they still want more.</p>

<p>Why do they want more?&nbsp; What is really at stake?<br /> </p>

<p>The conventional wisdom implies that the underlying reasons for this political fight concern abortion and Roe v. Wade.&nbsp; Yet everything I've been able to discern after watching and reading about D.C. politics for well over a decade now suggests that this is a mere cover story—a front for a more ambitious, far less popular, <a href="https://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/5/4/23931/56413">agenda</a>.&nbsp; That agenda is to use the courts to <a href="http://www.acsblog.org/judicial-nominations-700-the-return-of-constitution-in-exile.html">invalidate</a> much of the progressive legislation enacted since the 1930s that serves to regulate the behavior of large corporations.</p>

<p>But the GOP controls Congress and the Presidency, right?&nbsp; If they wanted to invalidate that legislation, they could just do so directly, right?</p>

<p>In principle, yes, but in practice, no.&nbsp; In fact, they tried to do so with much environmental-protection legislation in 1995 back when the Gingrichites and Delayicans first took over Congress.&nbsp; That was the era in which Tom Delay declared the Environmental Protection Agency to be the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Tom_DeLay">gestapo of government</a>.&quot;&nbsp; The public backlash to the GOP's attempted actions in 1995 and 1996 was so intense that it shook them deeply.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ever since then, the GOP has turned to the dark side and taken the road of deception:&nbsp; proclaiming&nbsp; that they support laws for clean air and clean water and safe workplaces and more, but then in the background, acting to undermine those very laws.&nbsp; Bush managed to pass himself off as a &quot;moderate&quot; to many people in 2000 via just that tactic.&nbsp; And the tactic continues to define the GOP/Bush domestic strategy to this day.&nbsp; For instance, their strategy on Social Security is to loudly proclaim support for the program's goals while proposing policies that would drastically weaken it; their strategy on air pollution is to create a program called &quot;Clear Skies&quot; that would actually allow more pollution than the Clean Air Act; their strategy on forests is to create a program called &quot;Healthy Forests&quot; that gives away our National Forests to logging companies in the guise of preventing forest fires.</p>

<p>The GOP and Bush realize, from the 1995 Gingrichite failure, that they cannot directly repeal popular and successful laws such as the National Labor Relations Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and Endangered Species Act.&nbsp; They also realize that they cannot use their control of the executive branch to thwart these laws indefinitely.&nbsp; They will be sued and eventually forced by courts to actually comply with the letter of the laws, as has happened many, many times over the last couple decades.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, the GOP can make sure that the judges who will decide these cases are in their pockets.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The ultimate goal of the GOP is to put <a href="http://hnn.us/articles/1780.html">activist judges</a> on the Supreme Court and appellate courts to invalidate or restrict those very laws, returning the U.S. to a time when corporate oligarchs could run the country with impunity, at the expense of the quality of life of the rest of us.</p>

<p>University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein gives us an <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0409.sunstein.html">example</a> of what may be in store for us if the GOP succeeds in their effort to stack the courts:</p><blockquote><p><em>But if several [Supreme Court] appointments are made under an extended Bush presidency,
the new court would likely do much more [than limit reproductive freedom]. It might strike down most
campaign-finance reform. It would probably be inclined to invalidate
parts of the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act as beyond
Congress' authority. It might well elevate commercial speech to the
same status as political speech--thus forbidding controls on
commercials by tobacco companies, among others. It would probably limit
congressional efforts to protect disabled people, women, and the
elderly from various forms of discrimination.</em></p></blockquote><p>If the GOP wants the country to move in this direction, let them try to do so legislatively rather than relying on this stealth judicial campaign.&nbsp; And then let the people of this country send them into the political wilderness for decades.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>[UPDATE (6/3):&nbsp; For those reaching this post via <a href="http://www.organicmatter.net/node/122">Tangled Bank #29</a>, this is actually a brief follow-up post to the one I meant to submit, called &quot;<a href="../../2005/05/nasa_cutting_sp.html">NASA cutting space science, too</a>.&quot;&nbsp; Sorry for the confusion.]</p>

<p>I apparently spoke too soon yesterday when I suggested that the next generation space telescope, the <a href="http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, was one of the few major NASA science initiatives still on track.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://skyandtelescope.com/news/article_1516_1.asp">Sky and Telescope</a> magazine (via <a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/archives/000547.html">Space Politics</a>):&nbsp; <br />
<em></em></p><blockquote><p><em>By far the worst problem for astronomers concerns the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), a 6.5-meter (256-inch) infrared observatory sometimes called Hubble's successor. It's a joint project of NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency. Various hurdles seem destined to delay its launch by at least a year, to no earlier than 2012, and threaten to increase the mission's cost by as much as $1 billion, to more than $3 billion. In response, NASA has asked the project to consider whether a 4-meter telescope with fewer scientific instruments could be flown instead. According to one astronomer on the Webb team, who asked to remain anonymous, &quot;such an observatory would not be worth continuing with&quot; because it wouldn't be able to compete scientifically with the next generation of giant ground-based telescopes except in a narrow range of infrared wavelengths. &quot;None of us believe it'd save the required amount of money anyway.&quot; </em></p>

<p></p>

<p><em>At this point it's anybody's guess what will happen to Webb. If NASA can't scrounge enough extra money to continue the project in its current form, perhaps by taking it from another mission, outright cancellation is a very real possibility. &quot;I don't know the technical and budget path we'll find,&quot; says senior project scientist John Mather (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center), &quot;but the JWST project management and science team are extremely determined to find a solution in working with our international partners and NASA Headquarters.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The <a href="http://rockymountainnews.com/drmn/state/article/0,1299,DRMN_21_3795086,00.html">Denver Rocky Mountain News</a> has more:<br />
<em></em></p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;I'd say it is a crisis,&quot; said John Mather, project scientist for the telescope at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. </em></p>

<p></p>

<p><em>&quot;(NASA) headquarters just doesn't have any more money for us,&quot; Mather said. &quot;Something's got to give, but we don't know what it's going to be.&quot; </em></p>

<p><em>Northrop Grumman recently informed NASA that the company and its subcontractors expect to spend $309 million more than planned, Mather said. In addition, the rocket that will launch the Webb telescope could cost more than expected. </em></p>

<p><em>Those and various other unforeseen increases bring the total overrun to about $1 billion, Mather said.</em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Small consolation that the JWST's problems don't appear to have much to do directly with NASA's new priorities, but with the old problem of cost overruns by contractors.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Of course, when the exploration effort inevitably suffers similar or even worse cost overruns in the future, the money will be siphoned from NASA science.&nbsp; The reverse clearly does not hold.&nbsp; If NASA science projects overrun, they risk being cancelled entirely.</p>
