                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Hans Bethe died on Sunday at the age of 98.&nbsp; Bethe has been an ancient, eminent figure in physics since I was a kid, and, given his great longevity and his continued scientific activity, it always seemed like he would hang around forever.&nbsp; So for this professionally-trained astrophysicist and lifetime science enthusiast, it is a sad moment.&nbsp; I never met him personally, but I did have the good fortune to hear him give a colloquium presentation at Caltech back in the early 1990s when I was a graduate student.&nbsp; It was like watching a living legend.</p>

<p>Obituaries are all over the papers, but <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-sci-bethe8mar08,0,5245350.story?coll=la-home-obituaries">this one</a> in the Los Angeles Times is particularly good.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.atomicarchive.com/Bios/BethePhoto.shtml"><img width="90" height="102" border="0" src="../../../images/bethe1_1.jpg" title="Bethe1_1" alt="Bethe1_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>His scientific and societal contributions were immense, but the one that stands out to me is that this is the guy who figured out the details of how the Sun shines.&nbsp; The Sun, source of all the energy that warms our planet and fosters the multitude of life forms it contains.&nbsp; Scientific problems do not come more basic and fundamental than that.</p><blockquote><p><em>Bethe was introduced to the problem at the 1938 Washington Conference
on Theoretical Physics, where astronomers speculated that perhaps
nuclear reactions were involved.<br /><br /> He went back to his office at
Cornell University after the meeting and within six weeks had solved
the problem. Given the known temperature of the core of the sun — about
20 million degrees Celsius (about 36 million degrees Fahrenheit) — and
the proportions of carbon, hydrogen and other elements in its interior,
he deduced which nuclear reactions could be responsible for its
radioactive fire.<br /><br /> He ultimately developed a six-step cycle in
which carbon and nitrogen atoms act as catalysts for the conversion of
four hydrogen nuclei (protons) into one helium nucleus. The very slight
mass lost in the process is converted into large amounts of energy,
according to Albert Einstein's famous equation, E = mc2. <br /><br />
Bethe later remarked with typical modesty that he found the answer by
&quot;looking through the periodic table [of elements] step by step. So you
see, this was a discovery by persistence, not by brains.&quot;<br /><br /> One
oft-told story about Bethe recounts the evening after he discovered the
secrets of starlight. During a late-night stroll, his fiancee, Rose —
daughter of theoretical physicist Paul Ewald — remarked on how
beautiful the stars looked. He responded: &quot;Yes, darling, and I'm the
only one on Earth who knows how they do it.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Yet as brilliant as Bethe was, and as encyclopedic as his knowledge of nuclear physics was, this was not a problem he solved on his own.&nbsp; And, as such, it is a great illustration of how real science actually works the vast majority of the time.&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://mt.sopris.net/mpc/sci/laws.html"><img width="90" height="103" border="0" src="../../../images/bethe2_1.jpg" title="Bethe2_1" alt="Bethe2_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>The stage was set for him to come in and work it out, but it took a lot of work to get that stage in order.&nbsp; As far as I know, Bethe was not a crucial figure in the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.&nbsp; That was accomplished by many other brilliant minds, including those of Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Enrico Fermi, and Paul Dirac.&nbsp; Bethe was not the fellow who surmised that nuclear reactions were the power source for the Sun.&nbsp; That was <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/sun_3.html">accomplished</a> by Sir Arthur Eddington in 1920, based on experimental work by F. W. Aston and theoretical work of Albert Einstein.&nbsp; Bethe also was not the first to quantitatively study nuclear reactions with quantum mechanics.&nbsp; That was <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/sun_4.html">accomplished</a> by George Gamov and others, just as Hans Bethe was starting his long career in physics.&nbsp; Bethe didn't even discover one of the crucial nuclear reaction cycles that powers some stars, the CNO cycle.&nbsp; That was <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/sun_4.html">done</a> by C. F. von Weizsäcker.</p>

<p>What Bethe did do was use all of this previous work to meticulously, quantitatively demonstrate for the first time which specific nuclear reactions occur in the centers of stars, and how the rates of these reactions vary with the mass and temperature of the star.&nbsp; As theoretical astrophysicist John Bahcall writes in an excellent <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/index.html">article</a> on the history of how the problem of the Sun's energy source was solved:</p><blockquote><p class="normaltext"><em>By April 1938, it was almost as if the scientific stage had been intentionally set for the entry of <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1967/index.html">Hans Bethe</a>, the acknowledged master of nuclear physics. Professor Bethe had just completed a classic set of three papers in which he reviewed and analyzed all that was then known about nuclear physics. These works were known among his colleagues as &quot;Bethe's bible.'' Gamow assembled a small conference of physicists and astrophysicists in Washington, D. C. to discuss the state of knowledge, and the unsolved problems, concerning the internal constitution of the stars.</em></p>

<p class="normaltext"><em>In the course of the next six months or so, Bethe worked out the basic nuclear processes by which hydrogen is burned (fused) into helium in stellar interiors. Hydrogen is the most abundant constituent of the sun and similar stars, and indeed the most abundant element in the universe.</em></p>

<p class="normaltext"><em>Bethe described the results of his calculations in a paper entitled &quot;Energy Production in Stars,'' which is awesome to read. He authoritatively analyzed the different possibilities for reactions that burn nuclei and selected as most important the two processes that we now believe are responsible for sunshine. One process, the so-called <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/sun_pp-chain.html">p-p chain</a>, builds helium out of hydrogen and is the dominant energy source in stars like the sun and less massive stars.</em></p>

<p class="normaltext"><em>The CNO cycle, the second process which was also considered by von Weizsäcker, is most important in stars that are more massive than the sun. Bethe used his results to estimate the central temperature of the sun and obtained a value that is within 20% of what we currently believe is the correct value (16 million degrees Kelvin)<sup>&nbsp;</sup>. Moreover, he showed that his calculations led&nbsp; to a relation between stellar mass and stellar luminosity that was in satisfactory agreement with the available astronomical observations.</em></p></blockquote><p>Yet even after Bethe's 1938 work, which won him the <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1967/">Nobel Prize</a> for Physics in 1967, the problem of how stars shine was not completely solved.&nbsp; For one thing, Bethe apparently <a href="http://nobelprize.org/physics/articles/fusion/sun_pp-chain.html">missed</a> a couple of the reactions involved.&nbsp; And also, he was even completely wrong on one point.&nbsp; In the <a href="http://fangio.magnet.fsu.edu/~vlad/pr100/100yrs/html/chap/fs2_05032.htm">abstract</a> to his seminal paper that Bahcall refers to above, Bethe wrote:</p><blockquote><p><em>It is shown further that </em>no elements heavier than He-4 can be built up in ordinary stars<em>. ......&nbsp; The heavier elements found in stars must therefore have existed already when the star was formed.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.astrosociety.org/membership/awards/01winners.html"><img width="90" height="100" border="0" src="../../../images/bethe3.jpg" title="Bethe3" alt="Bethe3" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>But in fact, it was later learned that the &quot;<a href="http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr162/lect/energy/triplealph.html">triple alpha</a>&quot; process (three helium nuclei colliding virtually simultaneously to fuse into a carbon nucleus), contrary to Bethe's initial claim, can occur, if only in the late stages of a star's life, when it is a red giant and the central temperature climbs from the tens of millions of degrees (Celsius) into the hundred of millions of degrees.&nbsp; So elements heavier than helium are indeed built up in ordinary stars.&nbsp; It is a good thing, too, because otherwise, there would be no carbon, oxygen, iron, etc, and what would we be made out of then?</p>

<p>Hans Bethe, a scientific giant, standing on the shoulders of other scientific giants, will be missed.</p><blockquote><p><em>Whether or not their governments respond to their advice, scientists
have an obligation to speak out publicly when they feel there are
dangers ahead.</em><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; —Hans Bethe</p></blockquote>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Remember last Wednesday's overblown <a href="../../../2005/02/another_overeag.html">article</a> on Space.com about NASA scientists discovering evidence for present life on Mars?&nbsp; It looks like many people had a similar reaction to <a href="../../../2005/02/another_overeag.html">mine</a> to that report:&nbsp; on Friday, NASA officially issued a <a href="http://www.lincolntribune.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=808">total denial</a> of any such finding.</p><blockquote><p><em>News reports on February 16, 2005, that NASA scientists from Ames
Research Center, Moffett Field, Calif., have found strong evidence that
life may exist on Mars are incorrect.</em></p>

<p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span face="arial">NASA
does not have any observational data from any current Mars missions that
supports this claim. The work by the scientists mentioned in the reports cannot
be used to directly infer anything about life on Mars, but may help formulate
the strategy for how to search for <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">martian</span></span>
life. <br /><br />Their research concerns extreme environments on Earth as analogs of
possible environments on Mars. No research paper has been submitted by them to
any scientific journal asserting <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">martian</span></span>
life.</span></span></em></p></blockquote><p>My worry that the original article would be widely picked up by the major press proved to be unfounded, fortunately.&nbsp; And NASA's relatively quick denial no doubt helped to quash the overhyped story.&nbsp; But, based on Google News, it was indeed picked up by several minor U.S. press outlets, and at least one major one, MSNBC.&nbsp; Many international outlets also picked it up.&nbsp; MSNBC was quick to run the NASA <a href="https://msnbc.msn.com/id/6994667/">denial</a> on Friday:</p><blockquote><p><em>NASA on Friday issued an unusual denial of a <a href="https://msnbc.msn.com/id/6981361/">report</a>
that its researchers saw strong evidence for life's existence on
present-day Mars, based in part on atmospheric methane readings. Other
scientists involved in Mars research said the jury was still out on the
meaning of Martian methane, but they agreed that the preliminary
findings were well worth a follow-up.</em></p></blockquote><p>In MSNBC's followup report, they tell us that the NASA scientists involved, while apparently not willing or not allowed to talk to the press, distributed an email to colleagues disputing the original Space.com report, claiming that it was based on &quot;inaccurate hearsay,&quot; in MSNBC's words.&nbsp; This is not surprising, of course, as the report did at least make clear that it was second-hand information being reported.&nbsp; (See the update below for the full text of this email.)</p>

<p>Space.com also published a <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars_methane_050218.html">followup article</a> Friday that reports NASA's denial while still doing their best to stand by their original report.&nbsp; It is clear, though, that they got overexcited about this, and reported with no concrete information, and worse, used the overblown headline implying that this was a major breakthrough.&nbsp; It turns out that there is not even a paper submitted to <em>Nature</em> for publication, as claimed in the original report.</p><blockquote><p><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span face="arial">Some attendees later had conflicting recollections
about what exactly Stoker said about her plans to publish her research. While
some said Stoker claimed she had submitted a paper to the journal </span></span></em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span face="arial">Nature</span></span><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span face="arial"> for publication in May, others
said Stoker only mentioned that she was preparing a paper for submission to </span></span></em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span face="arial">Nature.</span></span><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span face="arial"><o:p></o:p></span></span></em></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p></o:p></span></em><span face="arial"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nature</span></span><em><span face="arial"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> said it
normally does not comment on whether a paper is under consideration for
publication or has even been submitted. Carl <span class="SpellE">Ziemelis</span>,
the physical sciences editor at </span></span></em><span face="arial"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Nature</span></span><em><span face="arial"><span style="font-family: Arial;">
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on"></st1:city></st1:place>London, said
Feb. 18 that he was making an exception to that normal practice, telling </span></span></em><span face="arial"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Space News</span></span><em><span face="arial"><span style="font-family: Arial;"> that the journal is not
preparing to publish Stoker and Lemke’s research and that he first learned
about their work from news reports.</span></span></em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, I can easily see this whole episode being leapt upon and distorted by the Mars/NASA conspiracy kooks, such as <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/hoagland/index.html">Richard Hoagland</a>,
to further their ludicrous claims that NASA is
covering up all sorts of evidence of intelligent life on Mars.</p>

<p>On MSNBC science editor Alan Boyle's weblog <a href="https://msnbc.msn.com/id/7008583/#050221a">Cosmic Log</a>, a reader named Josh sums up my view succinctly:</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;I think MSN needs to be careful about what they say on national news.
You just don't go around telling people that there is life on Mars
unless there is sufficient evidence to do so. That's just bad
journalism!&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Perusing astronomer Phil Plait's <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/index.html">Bad Astronomy</a> website, I notice that he was all over this non-story last week.&nbsp; In fact, the day after Space.com's article appears and the day before NASA's official denial, Plait <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/phpBB/viewtopic.php?p=418683#418683">obtained</a> the email from one of the scientists involved that MSNBC's article referenced the next day.&nbsp; Here it is:</p><blockquote><p><em><span class="genmed"><strong>Dr. Carol Stoker wrote:</strong></span>	</em></p>

<p><em>
A story has appeared in Space.com which quotes us
inaccurately and without permission.&nbsp; The story is based on hearsay 
and is factually incorrect.
<br /><br />
Here are the facts:
<br /><br />
1. On Sunday night we were attending a private party
of space exploration enthusiasts in which there was a
discussion about the possible meaning of the results
from recent Mars missions.&nbsp; We engaged in the
discussion and expressed thoughts and opinions as individual scientists&nbsp; on our own time and did not
represent ourselves as speaking for NASA.
<br /><br />
2. No one at the party identified themselves as a
reporter, and in fact no reporters were present.&nbsp; This
article is based on hearsay about what somebody at the
party thought they heard us say. We think this
represents extremely poor journalistic standards.
<br /><br />
3. No Nature paper has been submitted with Rio Tinto
results.&nbsp; This claim is simply wrong and we did not
make this claim.&nbsp; The MARTE project has several papers
in preparation that describe the work we are doing at
Rio Tinto and the first results of that work, but
nothing has been submitted yet.&nbsp; Preliminary results
have been published in abstract form at various
scientific meetings. If you want to see what the MARTE
team has actually said about results from Rio Tinto
drilling and its relevance to life on Mars, go to
<a href="http://www.marteproject.com/" target="_blank">www.marteproject.com</a>&nbsp; and click on publications.&nbsp; All
our REAL publications are posted there.
<br /><br />
4. The work at Rio Tinto is relevant to finding life
in a subsurface terrestrial environment&nbsp; and can't be
used to infer anything about life on Mars, directly.
The Rio Tinto work by its very nature can't tell us if
there is life on Mars, but certainly&nbsp; helps formulate
the strategy for how to search for life on Mars.&nbsp; One
approach to searching for extant life on Mars is by
drilling. Partly for this reason, the MARTE project
was selected for funding by NASA's ASTEP program, out
of the Science Mission Directorate and is a joint
project between NASA and Spain's Center for
Astrobiology.</em></p></blockquote><p>In my opinion, if they want to be viewed as a credible source, Space.com really should do a full-fledged retraction of their original story.<br /> </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Another year, another <a href="http://www.birdsource.org/gbbc/">Great Backyard Bird Count</a>.&nbsp; Well, we actually hadn't participated in this volunteer science <a href="../../../2005/02/great_backyard_.html">event</a> since 1999, so we were excited about re-entering the fray.&nbsp; Especially since all it entailed was identifying and counting the birds in the one area where we actually are familiar with the species present—our exurban back-yard, outside San Antonio, on the fringes of the <a href="http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/view/EE/rxe1.html">Edwards Plateau</a>.&nbsp; For casual birders such as ourselves, this can make the difference between fun and frustration.</p>



<p><a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/cedarwaxwing_1.jpg"><img width="125" height="169" border="0" alt="Cedarwaxwing_1" title="Cedarwaxwing_1" src="../../../images/cedarwaxwing_1.jpg" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>On Saturday, our event started with a bang, if a bit prematurely, as my idefatigable partner spotted, through the foggy mist, a huge flock of <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Cedar_Waxwing.html">cedar waxwings</a> leaving a live oak tree in our neighbor's front yard.&nbsp; Three groups of thirty or forty birds each taking wing—around one hundred total.&nbsp; Cedar waxwings, sleek, sharp-looking birds, are not a rarity in our neighborhood; yet they are far from a daily sight for us, and certainly not in numbers so large.&nbsp; I was far down the street on my weekly jog and missed them.&nbsp; But shortly afterwards, from our back yard, we both spotted what must have been part of the same flock, perching at the top of a live oak tree in our own front yard.&nbsp; We counted at least twenty, even though they were fading into the mist even from that short distance.&nbsp; Within a few minutes the rest of the huge flock flew overhead, and the waxwings in our yard left to join them, heading off towards the same neighbor's yard where my partner had originally spotted them.&nbsp; We quickly ran down to the street and followed.</p>

<p>And there we found them again:&nbsp; many, many dozens of cedar waxwings, filling the large live oak tree to the brim, practically a bird on every branch.&nbsp; We watched with our binoculars from about fifty feet away, not wanting to spook them.&nbsp; The soupy air that morning dimmed the subtle colorings of the waxwings, but they were unmistakeable nonetheless.&nbsp; I creeped closer, trying to eliminate as much of the fog in front of them as possible.&nbsp; After a few minutes, the flock suddenly left the tree as one, and flew in a majestic circle around me, before returning to the same tree, with a smaller group breaking off and perching at the top of a leafless tree further away.&nbsp; A few minutes after that, they again rose up as one, this time flying off down the street to another tree barely visible through the fog.&nbsp; Watching the flock of waxwings in flight was hypnotic, as the large flock moved like a single organism, tightly grouped and swerving instantly and simultaneously.</p>

<p>The rest of the count that afternoon proved much more routine, as should probably be expected for a backyard bird count.&nbsp; (More experienced birders would no doubt find the cedar waxwings mundane as well.)&nbsp; We saw the usual robins (a large flock), chipping sparrows, tufted titmice, carolina chickadees, carolina wrens, northern cardinals, western scrub-jays, house finches, a northern mockingbird, and a golden-fronted woodpecker (by voice).&nbsp; </p>

<p>Other than the cedar waxwings, the notable thing about our count was more about what we didn't see during our allotted time:&nbsp; american goldfinches (which we see almost every day normally, and did indeed see later that day), and greater roadrunners (which we see routinely, though not even close to every day).&nbsp; We did venture off into the cedar scrub adjacent to our house in search of a hermit thrush, but to no avail.&nbsp; More persistent or skilled birders than us might have had more success, though, since we've spotted at least one out there before.</p>

<p>Sunday, my partner proved her indefatigable-ness, by spending another hour or so repeating our count.&nbsp; No cedar waxwings this day, but she was treated to the sight of a red-shouldered hawk swooping down on our yard, disturbing the peaceful frolicking of all the titmice, chickadees, sparrows, wrens, and cardinals, who one instant were pigging out at and around the feeder and bathing themselves in the birdbath, and the next instant were cowering deep within the foliage of a large shrub.</p>

<p>In the end, after all our backyard bird counting adventures, we tallied up our counts, and <a href="http://gbbc.birdsource.org/gbbcApps/input">submitted</a> them to the website of the Great Backyard Bird Count, where they will go into the <a href="http://www.birdsource.org/gbbc/results/index.html">database</a> of 35,368 similar counts from all across North America from Friday through Monday, and contribute to the scientific study of the winter distribution of bird populations across this continent.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Cover your eyes.&nbsp; There's another overblown headline about life on Mars.&nbsp; This one from <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars_life_050216.html">Space.com</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Exclusive: NASA Researchers Claim Evidence of Present Life on Mars</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>Alas, don't believe it yet.&nbsp; If you read the article, which, unlike the headline, is informative, you learn that this &quot;evidence of present life&quot; is nothing new, is indirect, and is still far from conclusive.&nbsp; Furthermore, the reporter learned of this second-hand, and it concerns research that has not yet even been accepted for publication.&nbsp; The author of the paper wouldn't comment to the reporter.&nbsp; (Or else the reporter just wasn't patient enough to wait for her to return his call.)</p>

<p>The foundation for the claim is actually some very intriguing data that were released a few months back:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/express_methane_040920.html">observations</a> from a probe in orbit around Mars indicating that the presence of methane, water vapor, and water ice on Mars are geographically correlated.&nbsp; Interesting stuff, but far, far from &quot;evidence of present life on Mars.&quot;&nbsp; The researchers in question apparently use this data, combined with their own recent studies of life in exotic locations on Earth, to argue that there may be life on Mars at this moment.&nbsp; Since the paper is still under peer-review, however, we cannot judge the quality of their argument.&nbsp; And more importantly, as far as I know, non-biological are not ruled out.</p>

<p>Given the explosiveness of the headline Space.com chose, this looks like another example of irresponsible science journalism.</p>

<p>Sadly, if this story gets picked up by the big news organizations, and I fear it will, people may start to get jaded by all these premature claims of discovering life on Mars.&nbsp; The most famous recent example, of course, is the 1996 nationally-televised NASA press conference about the Martian meteorite that allegedly had fossil evidence of ancient life on Mars—a find that remains controversial to this day.</p>

<p>If the day comes when we actually do discover convincing, conclusive evidence that life exists or once existed on Mars, I'm afraid people will say, &quot;So what?&nbsp; Didn't we already know that?&quot;&nbsp; Or else, &quot;Yeah right.&nbsp; How many times have you tried to tell us that before?&quot;</p>

<p>UPDATE (2-22-2005):&nbsp; Two days later, NASA issues a flat denial.&nbsp; I have a followup post <a href="../../../2005/02/life_on_mars_no.html">here</a>.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Via <a href="https://aboutown.blogspot.com/2005/02/tangled-bank-is-here.html">Tangled Bank</a>, a bi-weekly collection of natural science writings in weblogs, and <a title="10,000 Birds - February 2005" href="http://www.10000birds.com/february2005.htm#2/8/05">10,000 Birds</a>, I am reminded that the annual <a href="http://www.birdsource.org/gbbc/">Great Backyard Bird Count</a> is coming up.&nbsp; The weekend after next.&nbsp; It's fun; it's easy; and it's participatory science for amateur bird watchers such as myself.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/pr/GBBC_2005.html">Cornell Lab of Ornithology</a>:</p>

<table border="1"><blockquote><p><em>During the weekend of February 18 through 21, people across the North
American continent are encouraged to count the birds in their backyards
and report them over the Internet, as part of the Great Backyard Bird
Count (GBBC), one of the world's largest volunteer efforts of its kind.
In addition to its value as a research study, the GBBC allows people of
all ages and backgrounds to celebrate birds and provide vital
information about North America's birds.</em></p></blockquote></table>

<p>Here are the <a href="http://www.birdsource.org/gbbc/howTo.html">instructions</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>We need every bird enthusiast in North America to count for the birds!</em></p>
<p><em>All you need is basic knowledge of bird identification and access to
the Internet at home, a friend's house, local library, school, or
anywhere you can get access to the Web.<br /><br />
Here's what you do:</em></p>

<ul><li><em><strong>Count the birds</strong> in your backyard,local park, or other natural area on one or all four count days. You can count in as many
different locations as you wish, just make sure to keep separate
records and fill out a checklist for each area.</em></li><br />
<li><em><strong>Watch the birds</strong> for at least 15 minutes on each day that you participate. We recommend watching for a half-hour or more, so that you'll have a good sense of what birds are in your area.</em></li><br />
<li><em><strong>How to count:</strong> Your data will be used by scientists to analyze bird populations, so it is very important that everyone count their birds in exactly the same way. On the day(s) that you count, watch your bird feeders or take a short walk (less than 1 mile) in your neighborhood or park.<br /><br />For each kind (species) of bird that you see, keep track of the </em><em>highest number of individuals that you observe at any one time. Use a &quot;tally sheet&quot; to help keep</em><em> track of your counts. Your tally sheet should look something like the following:</em><br /><br />
<ul><li><em>House Finch - 3, 5, 3, 1</em></li>
<li><em>High Count = 5</em></li>
<li><em>Blue Jay - 1, 3, 6, 2</em></li>
<li><em>High Count = 6</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Be careful not to count the same bird over and over! Don't add
another Blue Jay to your tally every time you see a Blue Jay at the
feeder. </em><em>You could be seeing the same individual again and again.
If you record only the highest number of individual birds that you see
in view at one time, you're sure to never count the same bird more than
once!
</em></p></li>
<li><em>At the end of the day go to &quot;<strong>Submit your bird checklist&quot;</strong> on our GBBC web site. Fill out the questions about your location, local habitat, and count duration. Then enter your high counts for each species sighted on that day and location. You can submit one bird checklist for each day that you count or for each new area that you count in.<br /><br />
For example:</em><br />
<ul><li><em>If you count an four days at one location, you'd submit four different checklists.</em></li>
<li><em>If you count on four days at two different locations each day, submit eight checklists. And so on.</em></li></ul></li><br />
<li><em><strong>Problems getting access to the Internet?</strong> Many libraries, schools, bird clubs, and other community-based groups will be helping, too. If organizations in your area are not already planning to help those without Internet access, you can help get something started!</em></li><br />
<li><em><strong>Finally,</strong> after you've submitted your data, explore our web site. Check our results section to see other reports from your community, and watch as data come in from other areas. Have a look through our other pages, and find out other ways you can help birds.<br /><br />
Enjoy!</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>It's been a few years since we've remembered to participate in this, so we are overdue.&nbsp; Great fun for the whole family.</p>

<p>The first picture was taken from about 10 miles up, from what I understand.&nbsp; It clearly shows drainage patterns.&nbsp; Since Titan is too cold for liquid water, it must be something else.&nbsp; Apparently liquid methane is a likely candidate.&nbsp; As for the dark area on the right, a science correspondent on NPR called it a &quot;shoreline,&quot; suggesting it may be a lake of liquid methane or something.&nbsp; The resolution of the images I've seen are poor, but in some, I see features that look like they may be small craters.&nbsp; If those are real features and not artifacts, then that would obviously rule out any lake, at least in the limited view of this picture.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The weekly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/index.html">Science Times</a> is out and in it is another excellent article by Dennis Overbye, this time about the current state of string theory at 20 years of age.&nbsp; Most of the article is about string theory and string theorists, and relatively little is about its critics, but given the huge string theory hype in the physics community and lately in the general public as well, here are the parts I find worth highlighting:</p><blockquote><p><em>In the last 20 years, string theory has become a major branch of
physics. Physicists and mathematicians conversant in strings are
courted and recruited like star quarterbacks by universities eager to
establish their research credentials. String theory has been celebrated
and explained in best-selling books like &quot;The Elegant Universe,&quot; by Dr.
Brian Greene, a physicist at Columbia University, and even on popular
television shows.</em></p>

<p><em>Last summer in Aspen, Dr. Schwarz and Dr. Green (of Cambridge) cut a
cake decorated with &quot;20th Anniversary of the First Revolution Started
in Aspen,&quot; as they and other theorists celebrated the anniversary of
their big breakthrough. But even as they ate cake and drank wine, the
string theorists admitted that after 20 years, they still did not know
how to test string theory, or even what it meant.</em></p>

<p><em>As a result, the goal of explaining all the features of the modern
world is as far away as ever, they say. And some physicists outside the
string theory camp are growing restive. At another meeting, at the
Aspen Institute for Humanities, only a few days before the string
commemoration, Dr. Lawrence Krauss, a cosmologist at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland, called string theory &quot;a colossal failure.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>String theorists agree that it has been a long, strange trip, but they still have faith that they will complete the journey.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>Critics of string theory, meanwhile, have been keeping their own
scorecard. The most glaring omission is the lack of any experimental
evidence for strings or even a single experimental prediction that
could prove string theory wrong - the acid test of the scientific
process.</em></p>

<p><em>Strings are generally presumed to be so small that &quot;stringy&quot; effects
should show up only when particles are smashed together at prohibitive
energies, roughly 10<sup>19</sup> billion electron volts. That is
orders of magnitude beyond the capability of any particle accelerator
that will ever be built on earth. Dr. Harvey of Chicago
said he sometimes woke up thinking, What am I doing spending my whole
career on something that can't be tested experimentally?</em></p>

<p><em>This disparity between theoretical speculation and testable reality
has led some critics to suggest that string theory is as much
philosophy as science, and that it has diverted the attention and
energy of a generation of physicists from other perhaps more worthy
pursuits. Others say the theory itself is still too vague and that some
promising ideas have not been proved rigorously enough yet.</em></p>

<p><em>Dr. Krauss said, &quot;We bemoan the fact that Einstein spent the last 30
years of his life on a fruitless quest, but we think it's fine if a
thousand theorists spend 30 years of their prime on the same quest.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>At the end of the Aspen celebration talk turned to the prospect of
verification of string theory. Summing up the long march toward
acceptance of the theory, Dr. Stephen Shenker, a pioneer string
theorist at Stanford, quoted Winston Churchill:</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;This is not the end, not even the beginning of the end, but perhaps it is the end of the beginning.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>Dr. Shenker said it would be great to find out that string theory was right.</em></p>

<p><em>From the audience Dr. Greene piped up, &quot;Wouldn't it be great either way?&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Are you kidding me, Brian?&quot; Dr. Shenker responded. &quot;How many years have you sweated on this?&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>But if string theory is wrong, Dr. Greene argued, wouldn't it be
good to know so physics could move on? &quot;Don't you want to know?&quot; he
asked.</em></p>

<p><em>Dr. Shenker amended his remarks. &quot;It would be great to have an
answer,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;It would be even better if it's the right
one.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>











<p>The Dr. Greene referred to here is Brian Greene, perhaps the most famous of the string theorists, due to his books and television work.&nbsp; His book <em>Elegant Universe</em> is a must read for anyone interested in science, whether a fan of string theory or not.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Over the weekend, the New York Times published an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/05/national/05bird.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=">article</a> that provides an illustration of the means by which the Bush administration undermines the work of scientists in favor of their own anti-environmental, pro-corporate-crony agenda.</p><blockquote><p><em>LA JOLLA, Calif., Dec. 4 - The scientific opinions of a Bush
administration appointee at the Interior Department with no background
in wildlife biology were provided as part of the source material for
the panel of Fish and Wildlife Service biologists and managers who
recommended against giving the greater sage grouse protection under the
endangered species act.</em></p>

<p><em>The appointee, Julie MacDonald, a senior policymaker, criticized
studies showing widespread loss of grouse territory and sporadic
declines in grouse populations.</em></p>

<p><em>Recommendations by the department's panels of experts are usually
followed. Steve Williams, director of the Fish and Wildlife Service,
must make a final decision by Dec. 29.</em></p>

<p><em> The sage grouse, whose habitat overlaps areas of likely oil and gas deposits across states like Wyoming and Montana,
would likely become an economic headache to the energy and cattle
industries if it were listed. A listing can trigger extensive
regulation and increase costs and delays.</em></p>
<p><em> Mr. Williams, who is attending a Western governors' conference on the Endangered Species Act in San Diego, said on Friday that the scientists and bureau personnel who made
the recommendation not to protect the greater sage grouse were given
two extensive internal reviews of the state of scientific knowledge on
the grouse and its sagebrush territory.</em></p>
<p><em>One was done by federal biologists. Another version was provided by
Ms. MacDonald, deputy assistant interior secretary and their political
overseer, who peppered the biologists' draft with barbed commentary and
made wholesale changes. &quot;What was provided to the panel,&quot; Mr. Williams
said, &quot;was both the unedited version and the version with comment.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Ms. MacDonald's critique of sage grouse biology and the biologists
who work for an agency she oversees showed flashes of her strong
property-rights background and her deference to industry views. </em></p>
<p><em>Among other comments, Ms. MacDonald called science saying the birds
had numbered in the millions before settlers arrived in the 19th
century &quot;simply a fairy tale, constructed out of whole cloth.&quot; She also
questioned whether the grouse was dependent on sagebrush during the
winter, saying &quot;they will eat other stuff if it is available.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em> Mr. Williams and two specialists on grouse said that its seasonal dependence on sagebrush was uncontested among biologists.</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p><em>The issue of political overseers modifying information from federal
scientists that conflicts with policy goals has arisen periodically in
recent years, most notably in the area of climate change. It has not
been as visible in biology, an arena important to conservation groups,
extractive industries and others concerned with the Endangered Species
Act.</em></p>
<p><em>The consistent thrust of Ms. MacDonald's critique was to dismiss the
methodology behind studies that indicated significant declines in
grouse population or habitat, to denigrate many studies as mere
&quot;opinion&quot; and to seek inclusion of industry comments that she found
compelling.</em></p>
<p><em>She eliminated, in her editing, more than half of the references to
the most recent &quot;conservation assessment,&quot; a 610-page compilation and
partial analysis of all available data on sage grouse populations,
territory, historical trends and adaptability by a group of experts
written for the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies.</em></p>
<p><em> &quot;We should treat it as we would treat an industry publication,&quot; she
wrote. Ms. MacDonald also recommended deleting extensive sections on
the loss of sagebrush habitats to agriculture. And after the
biologist-authors from Fish and Wildlife summarized studies showing
population decline, Ms. MacDonald inserted a passage beginning &quot;all of
these data are badly flawed in some manner.&quot;<br /></em></p></blockquote><p>For fans of scientists and the scientific method, there is much here to be outraged about, especially since this is no doubt far from an isolated example of the current Federal government's treatment of scientists and their work.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Perhaps the most outrageous comment is the one where the political appointee says that a compendium of a large number of scientific studies of sage grouse populations should be treated as &quot;an industry publication.&quot;&nbsp; So now the full body of scientific knowledge is viewed as just another interest group with an agenda, the same as the product of any corporate lobbying effort.&nbsp; Disgraceful beyond words for a country that used to pride itself on standing at the forefront of knowledge.</p>
