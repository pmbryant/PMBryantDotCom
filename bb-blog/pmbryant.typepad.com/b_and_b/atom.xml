<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>Texas has been hit with a record drought over the past 15 months.&#0160; The first few weeks of December saw a little relief, but forecasts call for the drought to likely continue well into next year.<br /><br />Apparently the Texas parks system has been hit hard in the budget as a result, and they are now asking for people to send donations to help keep our state parks open.&#0160; <br /><br />Please consider donating if you love Texas state parks.&#0160; You can do so at the website of the <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/spdest/parkinfo/help/?utm_campaign=SPFundraising&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_source=PressRelease." target="_self">Texas Parks and Wildlife Department</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">Record drought and heat, devastating wildfires, and a drop in visitation have led to a critical situation for state parks.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">We need to raise $4.6 million to keep state parks operating, and we can&#39;t do it without you.</span></p>
<h4 style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">There are three simple ways you can help:</span></h4>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;">1. <span style="color: #033d21;">Make a year-end, tax-deductible donation.</span><br /><span style="color: #033d21;">2. Make a donation when it&#39;s time for you to renew your vehicle registration.</span><br /><span style="color: #033d21;">3. Most importantly, because visitor fees pay for about half of all park operating costs, visit a state park this holiday season.</span></p>
<ol style="padding-left: 60px;"> </ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">Please act now, to help keep Texas State Parks open for everyone to enjoy. Our state parks won&#39;t be the same without you.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">Thank you,</span><br /><span style="color: #033d21;">Carter Smith</span><br /><span style="color: #033d21;">TPWD Executive Director</span></p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>At TPMCafe, Robert Reich has a good summary of how Republican party is pitting Americans against Americans in oder for their obscenely wealthy patrons to re-assert control over the country and the vast majority of its money and resources.&#0160; He <a href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/02/18/the_republican_strategy/" target="_self">begins</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;">The Republican strategy is to split the vast middle and working class  - pitting unionized workers against non-unionized, public-sector  workers against non-public, older workers within sight of Medicare and  Social Security against younger workers who don&#39;t believe these programs  will be there for them, and the poor against the working middle class.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;">By splitting working America along these lines, Republicans want  Americans to believe that we can no longer afford to do what we need to  do as a nation. They hope to deflect attention from the increasing share  of total income and wealth going to the richest 1 percent while the  jobs and wages of everyone else languish.</span></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/0217/Union-battle-echoes-beyond-Wisconsin-We-re-fighting-for-our-very-existence" target="_self">assault on workers&#39; rights</a> in Wisconsin recently launched by its new governor Scott Walker is only one particularly visible and intense battle.&#0160; Those of us who don&#39;t want to see the country fall into the control of &quot;robber barons&quot; reminiscent of the late 19th century should <a href="http://www.wisaflcio.org/index.cfm?action=article&amp;articleID=e853549c-2ec7-40b6-954c-c6b096b09e72" target="_self">stand with Wisconsin workers</a>, and those of other states, in this battle.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>I was surprised and encouraged to hear this news.&#0160; Instead of <a href="http://pmbryant.typepad.com/b_and_b/2010/10/state-park-swap-in-the-works.html" target="_self">losing access</a> to a large, remote natural area in order to gain another, smaller, but more accessible, one, the people of Texas will be able to use both thanks to private donations.&#0160;</p>
<p>From today&#39;s <a href="http://www.statesman.com/sports/state-to-buy-devils-river-ranch-1136646.html" target="_self">Austin American-Statesman</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">Using a remarkable pool of private contributions totaling more than $10  million, the commission agreed to buy the Devils River Ranch from  Dallas-area home builder Rod Sanders for $13 million.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">The ranch fronts the east side of the Devils River for about 10 miles before  the river begins merging with the Amistad International Reservoir on the Rio  Grande near Del Rio. The ranch, which is largely desert scrub, includes a  large lodge, several other residences and an airstrip.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">The Devils River State Natural Area also is on the east side of the river  about 13 miles upstream, and the two properties will compose a single state  nature complex on the river.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">The purchase means that the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department now controls  about 38,000 acres adjacent to Devils River, which is only 90 miles long but  is regarded as the purest natural waterway in Texas and is considered sacred  by anglers, paddlers, campers, hikers and wildlife lovers.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">The deal was in contrast to a land swap proposal in early November in which  the state and Sanders would have exchanged ownership of the two large  tracts, and Sanders would have received $8 million in cash.</span></p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to checking this place out.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>How is Obama going to handle the Republicans who are virtually unanimously out to destroy him?&#0160; As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/opinion/03krugman.html?hp" target="_self">Paul Krugman</a> relates, his recent words and actions are not a good sign.&#0160; I hope this changes very soon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">Mr. Obama’s [freezing federal workers&#39;] pay ploy might, just might, have been justified if he  had used the announcement of a freeze as an occasion to take a strong  stand against Republican demands  —  to declare that at a time when  deficits are an important issue, tax breaks for the wealthiest aren’t  acceptable. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #033d21;">But he didn’t. Instead, he apparently intended the pay freeze  announcement as a peace gesture to Republicans the day before a  bipartisan summit. At that meeting, Mr. Obama, who has faced two years  of complete scorched-earth opposition, declared that he had failed to  reach out sufficiently to his implacable enemies. He did not, as far as  anyone knows, wear a sign on his back saying “Kick me,” although he  might as well have.</span></p>
<p>I do remember that there were times in 1995 after the last Republican takeover during a Democratic administration when I was about completely fed up with Bill Clinton.&#0160; His signing of the <a href="http://www.hcn.org/issues/89/2748" target="_self">salvage logging rider</a>, suspending environmental laws to permit accelerated logging in U.S. National Forests, was almost the last straw for me.&#0160; Fortunately Clinton realized his mistakes and turned things around in time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>The Paycheck Fairness Act may come up for a vote in the U.S. Senate today.&#0160; This is a critical piece of legislation that addresses several shortfalls in current laws against unequal pay for women.&#0160; We know from personal experience that these shoftfalls need to be addressed before we can hope to achieve the decades-old goal of equal pay.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/11/17/importance-equal-pay-women" target="_self">Terrel McSweeny</a> writes at whitehouse.gov:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;">Wage discrimination is real.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #3b5738;">Just ask Lilly Ledbetter.&#0160; She is a mother.&#0160; She didn’t seek a “less stressful work environment” than her male counter parts.&#0160; And she was paid roughly 30% less.&#0160;&#0160; If she had been allowed to share information about her pay with her colleagues she would have realized she was being paid less than men with less experience.</span><br /><br /><span style="color: #3b5738;">But Lilly couldn’t bring that case.&#0160; She could have lost her job if she discussed her pay with her colleagues.&#0160; The Paycheck Fairness Act would provide that protection. The author [of a Wall Street Journal op-ed] is right there are a lot of laws aimed at this problem – but because they don’t provide basic tools like pay transparency, discrimination persists. </span></p>
<p>Also see <a href="http://boston.com/community/blogs/on_liberty/2010/11/scott_brown_support_paycheck_f.html" target="_self">Carol Rose</a> at boston.com:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;">Lawmakers meant for The Equal Pay Act of 1963 to ensure equal pay for  equal work, but over time, because of weak remedies and loopholes in  the law, significant disparities in pay persist.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;">The Paycheck Fairness Act would give employees the legal tools they  need to finally close the wage gap by, for example, requiring employers  to demonstrate that wage differences between men and women doing the  same work have a business justification; prohibiting retaliation against  workers who inquire about their wages; and leveling the playing field  by ensuring that women can obtain the same remedies as those subject to  employment discrimination based on their race or national origin. The  bill would also provide technical assistance to employers and provide  important safeguards for small businesses.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;"> The Paycheck Fairness Act already passed the U.S. House of  Representatives with bipartisan support and now has 40 co-sponsors in  the Senate—more than it has ever had in any previous Congress.   Recently, a report from the White House National Economic Council  underscored the need for the Paycheck Fairness Act as an important step  towards the economic security of women and our nation’s families.</span></p>
<p>If we want the tools to eliminate pay discrimination against women, it is time to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.</p></div>

<p id="id2423406" style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;">The  swap/purchase would put into Texas Parks and Wildlife Department hands a  &quot;spectacular,&quot; much more accessible-to-the-public tract that could  become &quot;one of the premier parks in our system,&quot; said Scott Boruff, TPWD  deputy executive director.</span></p>
<p id="id2423413" style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;">But  some conservation organizations and paddler/anglers are leery of the  deal, questioning the logic of the transaction, TPWD&#39;s procedures for  informing the public about the proposed exchange and the impact on  paddlers of trading away the only public land along the upper reaches of  the Devils.</span></p>
<p id="id2424013" style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;">&quot;There  are several things that concern us. How are they going to pay for it?  Not just the up-front costs — the $8 million - but development,  operational and maintenance costs, particularly given the economic  issues state agencies are facing,&quot; Ken Kramer, director of the Lone Star  Chapter of the Sierra Club, said of the Devils River swap/purchase  proposal. &quot;And we&#39;re certainly concerned with what seems like a rush to  get this deal done quickly, without much notice and opportunity for  public input. The first I heard about it was last week. It doesn&#39;t  appear to me they are living up to the spirit of their policy on land  transactions.&quot;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;">...</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="color: #3b5738;">The Devils River swap/purchase has been discussed only in  closed-to-the-public executive session of the TPW Commission. The Nov. 4  TPW Commission meeting at which the proposal will be considered for  adoption will be the first meeting at which the transaction is publicly  discussed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #3b5738;"><span style="color: #111111;">Hopefully this can be considered with a bit more deliberation and public discussion.</span><br /></span></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p>After so many seemingly interminable months of back-and-forth, is health insurance reform finally imminent?&#0160; It is <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2009/12/healthcare-gets-60">looking that way</a>, thankfully.&#0160; The bill is not as strong as most of us would like, but it still represents a drastic improvement on the status quo for a huge number of people.&#0160; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/opinion/18krugman.html?em=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1261256735-lgEJUnom4ggf07N8oVFCFw">Paul Krugman</a> summed it up in the New York Times a few days ago:</p><blockquote><blockquote><span style="color: #007f40;">[L]et’s all take a deep breath, and consider just how much good
this bill would do, if passed — and how much better it would be than
anything that seemed possible just a few years ago. With all its flaws,
the Senate health bill would be the biggest expansion of the social
safety net since Medicare, greatly improving the lives of millions.
Getting this bill would be much, much better than watching health care
reform fail.</span><span style="color: #007f40;">At its core, the bill would do two things. First, it
would prohibit discrimination by insurance companies on the basis of
medical condition or history: Americans could no longer be denied
health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, or have their
insurance canceled when they get sick. Second, the bill would provide
substantial financial aid to those who don’t get insurance through
their employers, as well as tax breaks for small employers that do
provide insurance.</span><span style="color: #007f40;">All of this would be paid for in large part with the first serious effort ever to rein in rising health care costs.</span><p><span style="color: #007f40;">The
result would be a huge increase in the availability and affordability
of health insurance, with more than 30 million Americans gaining
coverage, and premiums for lower-income and lower-middle-income
Americans falling dramatically. That’s an immense change from where we
were just a few years ago: remember, not long ago the Bush
administration and its allies in Congress successfully blocked even a
modest expansion of health care for children. </span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>As the title of his piece says, &quot;Pass the bill!&quot;.</p><p></p></div>

<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">Lou Waters was one. Now 70, he can hop across white boulders to explore the grottos like a 10-year-old.</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">On Friday, he plans to sign paperwork to transfer more than 600
acres of his neighboring ranch to the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department to be added to Lost Maples. Another 100 acres will be
transferred this fall.</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">Agency staff said the public should have access to trails on the new
addition — which is a third of the park&#39;s current size — by 2012.</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">State appraisers valued the land at more than $2 million, but Waters
is selling it for $1.5 million because he wants to see the land and its
Can Creek watershed protected forever.</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">Land acquisition funds from the Parks and Wildlife Department and a $400,000 federal conservation grant will pay for it.</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">“You see it and you just want to take care of it,” Waters said.</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">In a memo explaining the sale, Waters said walking through the Can
Creek canyons in the fall under the native big-tooth maples was like
“hiking in a golden-red cathedral.”</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">His wife, Wanda Waters, said, “It just makes you feel so good that other people are going to be able to enjoy it.”</p><p>Lost Maples is about two hour drive west of here and a spectacular park as it is.&#0160; Excellent news that it will soon be about 30% larger.</p></div>

is at risk of having its natural resources decline through overuse.&#0160;
Purchasing an additional 732 acres of land adjacent to Lost Maples will
help protect more of this invaluable and rapidly vanishing habitat.</p>

<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">Dear Mr. Hollingsworth:</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">I
will not be able to attend the May 27, 2009 meeting described below.&#0160; I
wish to submit my opinion for public comment.&#0160; I strongly support
TP&amp;W Commission accepting donation of 3000 acres adjacent to
Government Canyon State Park in Bexar County.&#0160; <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1240668961_15" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">Government Canyon State Park</span> is a wonderful asset that the public is just starting to utilize.&#0160;&#0160; With such close proximity <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1240666491_11"><span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1240668961_16">to San Antonio, it</span></span>
is expected the park will be heavily utilized.&#0160; The City of San Antonio
Parks and Natural Areas are already over-utilized and crowded.&#0160;
Accepting donation of additional land adjacent to Government Canyon
will help protect more of this invaluable and rapidly vanishing habitat.</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">&#0160;</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">Sincerely,</p>
<p style="color: #007f40; font-family: Arial; margin-left: 80px;">(name and address)</p><br /></div>
