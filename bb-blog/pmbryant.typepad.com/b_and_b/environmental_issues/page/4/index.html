		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The Republican-controlled Congress recently was thwarted in its attempt to drill for oil in one of America's most special wildlife refuges, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northern Alaska.  But now, the Bush administration has unilaterally opened up another Alaskan ecological treasure for industrial development.  From the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/environment/la-na-drilling12jan12,0,4945422.story?coll=la-news-environment">Los Angeles Times</a> late last week:<blockquote><em>The Department of Interior on Wednesday approved oil and gas drilling on Alaska land considered such sensitive wildlife habitat that it was first protected by former Interior Secretary James G. Watt under President Reagan, and by four Interior secretaries since.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The plan, signed by Deputy Assistant Interior Secretary Chad Calvert, will open up more than 500,000 acres in and around Teshekpuk Lake on Alaska's oil-rich North Slope.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>What's the big deal, one may say?  This lake is in an area called the "National Petroleum Reserve," a tag that dates from the administration of Warren G. Harding.  That certainly makes it sound like it's not good for anything but oil drilling.  </p>

<p>But that name clearly belies the nature of the land it purports to label.</p>

<p>What is the real Teshekpuk Lake?  A couple weeks ago, the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002716137_arctic02sidebar.html">Seattle Times</a> wrote about it:<blockquote><em>Amid the sprawling sameness of Alaska's tundra is an oval pool of fresh water nine times the size of Lake Washington.</p>

<p>Teshekpuk Lake supports one of the largest bird-nesting sites in North America. Inupiat hunters camp here among the heather and wild poppies to track wolverines or shoot ducks or net eellike burbot and catch whitefish.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"Here we have a huge biologically active area that's precious to us," said Marie Carroll, an Inupiat whose family hunted here for generations. "But all you hear down south is 'Save the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>On a clear day this summer, 70 miles from the nearest road, thousands of spindly-legged shorebirds fluttered in from as far as Japan or South America to shed their feathers.</p>

<p>Newborn caribous traipsed along a crooked scratch of creek, feeding on cotton grass.</p>

<p>A black loon slid across a pond that looked like it was stamped into the tundra by giant boot heels.</p>

<p>Life flourishes on this marshy plain, biologists say, because of what's absent: roads, artificial lights, trails — and people.</p>

<p>"It's the beating heart," said George Ahmaogak, an Inupiat whale hunter who just retired as mayor of the North Slope Borough, Northern Alaska's municipal government. "The area is abundant with fish, caribou, brant, white snow geese. It's full of berries. It's one of the last completely undisturbed areas. It's God's country."</em></blockquote>In the late 1990s, thanks to a compromise worked out by President Clinton's Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt, nearly ninety percent of this area of the National Petroleum Reserve was opened up to oil exploration, leaving the area around Teshekpuk Lake protected.  But, based on this latest action, the GOP clearly wants it all.</p>

<p>The administration claims they are attempting to mitigate the impact of industrial development of the populations of nesting migratory birds and caribou.<blockquote><em>But conservation groups blasted the plan and said there were no guarantees the restrictions would remain in place.</p>

<p>"[The Bureau of Land Management is] notorious for granting waivers to their own rules," said Stanley E. Senner, a biologist who is executive director of Audubon Alaska.</p>

<p>"This plan is utterly unbalanced. Even the Reagan administration protected the waterfowl habitat around Teshekpuk Lake because of its world-class ecological and cultural value," Senner said. "No one should be fooled by the window dressing … this plan makes every last acre available for oil development."</p>

<p>Chuck Clusen, director of the Natural Resource Defense Council's Alaska Project, said the BLM "is supposed to balance all values of our public lands. Giving 100% to the oil industry is not what anyone would call balanced."</em></blockquote></p>

<p>What chance does wildlife have in the long run as a neighbor to heavy industry in an isolated corner of the world?<blockquote><em>"Once they start building permanent oil structures, you'll have roads, pipelines — all of which can alter the flow, and the flow of wetlands is complex," [scientist and government consultant Larry] Moulton said.</p>

<p>Moulton is part of a scientific blitzkrieg that has descended on these meadows with biologists trying to study everything from snow geese to caribous before oil rigs arrive. The reason: Much remains unknown about Teshekpuk.</p>

<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has warned that shorebirds return to the same areas each year, so some could be wiped out if breeding sites are disturbed.</p>

<p>State of Alaska scientists have told the BLM that molting geese — featherless and unable to flee — are vulnerable because noise and movement harm their young, and oil development draws foxes and bears, which eat the garbage people leave behind. Scientists have even shown that helicopters so stress Pacific brant that the birds burn more calories.</p>

<p>And "the petroleum reserve is far better than the Arctic Refuge as far as sheer numbers and variety of birds," said Rick Lanctot, a bird expert with the federal fish and wildlife agency. "The diversity and density is just much higher."</em></blockquote>What else will our oil hunger, egged on by our alleged leaders in the Republican-controlled government, destroy before we are done?</p>

                                <p>A mixture of bad news and absence of bad news from our corruptly-led Congress today:  the regressive budget bill passed by the slimmest of margins (no doubt <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/12/21/165851/78">by design</a>), yet the GOP's despicable tactic of attaching the extremely controversial proposal to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to the defense appropriations bill failed thanks to a filibuster by Democrats and a pair of Republicans.</p>

<p><a href="https://rhetoricrhythm.blogspot.com/2005/12/scrooge-mccheney.html">Mike Thomas</a> summarizes the budget bill at his blog, Rhetoric and Rhythm.</p>

<p>On the measure to drill in the Arctic Refuge, the Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/21/AR2005122101252.html">writes</a>:<blockquote><em>In debate before the cloture vote, [Senator Ted Stevens, R-Alaska] told fellow senators, "We know this Arctic. You don't know the Arctic at all." At issue, he said, was "2,000 acres of the Arctic," the amount of land in the refuge that would be opened for drilling. "Is that worth this fight?"</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) said that even though the bill provides vital defense funding, he was joining the filibuster on principle to prevent attachments such as the drilling provision. "If we yield to this tactic on ANWR," he said, "next year it will be someone else's pet project attached to the defense spending bill."</em></blockquote>Stevens has trashed any remaining integrity he may have had with his actions in recent days, essentially holding funds for our troops and for relief for Katrina victims hostage to his pet project.</p>

<p>Kudos to Senator Lieberman for standing up to this blackmail and helping to defeat it.</p>

<p>Shame on Senator John McCain, who just yesterday <a href="http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=33057&dcn=todaysnews">talked</a> a good game about the legislative tactics of Stevens and others ("Our system is broken if our national security is at stake and we carry on spending for the special interests as if nothing were wrong"), but who was unwilling to do anything about it.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/12/arctic-national-wildlife-refuge-is.html">Matt</a> at Just Another Blog has more on the Arctic Refuge drilling vote.</p>

                                <p>This may come as little surprise, but it is still outrageous.  Bush now requires loyalty oaths from mid-level managers in the Park Service.  Via <a href="http://www.peer.org/news/news_id.php?row_id=598">Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility</a>:<br />
<em><blockquote>Washington, DC — The National Park Service has started using a political loyalty test for picking all its top civil service positions, according to an agency directive released today by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). Under the new order, all mid-level managers and above must also be approved by a Bush administration political appointee.</p>

<p>The October 11, 2005 order issued by NPS Director Fran Mainella requires that the selection criteria for all civil service management slots (Government Service grades or GS-13, 14 and 15) include the “ability to lead employees in achieving the …Secretary’s 4Cs and the President’s Management Agenda.” In addition, candidates must be screened by Park Service headquarters and “the Assistant Secretary [of Interior] for Fish, and Wildlife, and Parks,” the number three political appointee in the agency.</p>

<p>The order represents a complete centralization of Park Service promotion and hiring in what has traditionally been a decentralized agency. More strikingly, the order is an unprecedented political intrusion into what are supposed to be non-partisan, merit system personnel decisions.</p>

<p>The President’s Management Agenda includes controversial policies and proposals such as aggressive use of outsourcing to replace civil servants, reliance on “faith-based initiatives” and rollbacks of civil service rights. </blockquote></em></p>

<p>How much longer are we stuck with this dictatorial group in power?  More importantly, what will be the long-term damages to our democracy?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Local blog <a href="http://allthingsconservative.typepad.com/all_things_conservative/2005/06/yay_global_warm.html">All Things Conservative</a> has a post about a recent article from a British newspaper, the Telegraph, that claims that global warming will bring about plenty of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/06/12/nwarm12.xml">good things</a>. </p>

<p>If only.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.organicmatter.net/node/131">Organic Matter</a> has already laid into portions of the article.&nbsp; But I can't resist commenting further.</p>

<p>&quot;Global warming is good.&quot;&nbsp; This is actually an old talking point.&nbsp; In fact, an entire organization exists to promote it: the pleasant-sounding <a href="http://www.greeningearthsociety.org/">Greening Earth Society</a>, funded by the <a href="http://www.westernfuels.org/">Western Fuels Association</a>.&nbsp; Yes, the coal industry.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Telegraph article, focusing on these alleged benefits of global warming, fails to mention any real benefits that apply outside of northern, fairly wealthy countries such as the United Kingdom, Russia, Canada, and the United States.&nbsp; And some of the benefits for those countries that it mentions are pathetically meager:</p><blockquote><p><em>Last year, a team at the University of Hamburg showed
that a modest temperature rise would lead to 30 per cent more tourists
visiting countries such as Russia and Canada.</em></p>

<p><em>The
benefits to UK tourism may also be substantial, according to a recent
study by the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia,
which concluded: &quot;We may witness not only an expansion in the domestic
market, but an expansion in the inbound international market as the UK
develops a more Mediterranean climate.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Left unsaid is the distinct possibility that climate change brought on by global warming could end up shutting down the Atlantic gulf stream that currently keeps northern Europe far warmer than most other areas at such high latitudes.&nbsp; But perhaps the UK could develop a new skiing industry to attract tourists in that case.</p>

<p>After all, as the article points out, humans are endlessly adaptable, and we really shouldn't sell them short.</p><blockquote><p><em>Climate scientists have made little of the benefits of a warming
planet, and even less of the ability of humans to cope with the
consequences. From the changes in irrigation and new crops made by
American farmers that prevented a repetition of the 1930s Dust Bowl, to
the sea-wall system that protects northern Vietnam, there is no lack of
evidence for human inventiveness in the face of climate change.</em></p></blockquote><p>Left unsaid is how much this coping will cost, and how much human suffering will take place in the meantime.&nbsp; A repetition of the Dust Bowl was avoided, but wouldn't it have been better to have prevented it in the first place?</p>

<p>The low point of the article comes with a quote from Philip Stott, emeritus professor of biogeography at the University of London.</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;If you could vote for a change in climate, you would always want a
warmer one,&quot; says Philip Stott, emeritus professor of biogeography at
the University of London. &quot;Cold is nearly always worse for everything -
the economy, agriculture, disease, biodiversity&quot;.</em></p></blockquote><p>As Organic Matter puts it, this is &quot;surprisingly idiotic.&quot;&nbsp; I would prefer not to use such harsh words (especially since Professor Stott has his own <a href="https://greenspin.blogspot.com/">blog</a>!), but the fellow at Organic Matter does have a point.&nbsp; What would Stott's vote be if given a choice between the Little Ice Age of a few centuries ago and, say, the planet Venus?</p>

<p>Back on Earth, the climate is a lot more complicated than simple choices between &quot;warm&quot; climates and &quot;cold&quot; ones.&nbsp; Stott also neglects that we are starting from a period as warm or warmer than any other period in at least the last <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=122">thousand years</a>.</p>

<p>The only interesting point the Telegraph article brings up is global warming's effect upon agriculture.&nbsp; But even here, the article overemphasizes modest potential benefits in northern, wealthy nations, while neglecting the almost certain downsides for agriculture in developing countries.&nbsp; This is an interesting subject, though, that I am now inspired to learn more about.</p>

<p>Finally, the article closes with the old canard, from Professor Stott, about how doing anything to combat emissions of greenhouse gases and reduce global warming will destroy the global economy.</p><blockquote><p><em>Even if we shut every fossil-fuel power station, crushed every car and
grounded every aircraft, the Earth's climate would still continue to
get warmer, according to Prof Stott. &quot;The trouble is, we would all be
too impoverished to cope with the consequences,&quot; he said.</em></p></blockquote><p>Someone tell Stott not to worry—no one is proposing any such actions!&nbsp; Developing the new energy technologies that necessary to reduce greenhouse gases should be a net economic boon, as almost all innovative work is.&nbsp; Someone with the supreme confidence in human invention that Stott has should be able to see that.</p>

<p>On his blog, <a href="https://greenspin.blogspot.com/2005_06_12_greenspin_archive.html#111885458982133953">Stott</a> wrote yesterday:</p><blockquote><p><em>It is nearly obscene, with all our resources, to think that we shall not be able to adapt once again - <span style="font-style: italic;">unless, that is, we have lost our evolutionary dynamism and drive</span>.</em></p></blockquote><p>With that attitude, Stott should feel comfortable with our ability to adapt to using the new energy sources necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Due to the constantly rising price of real estate and the rapid speed of development in rural areas all over the country, conservations easements, rather than outright land purchases, are increasingly being used by environmental organizations and governments to preserve open space.&nbsp; Certainly conservation easements are used very frequently here in the <a href="../../../2005/05/san_antonio_pro.html">San
Antonio area</a> to help preserve undeveloped land over the Edwards aquifer
recharge zone.</p>

<p>Landowners sell or donate the development rights to their property to land trusts dedicated to overseeing the land, such as <a href="http://nature.org/">The Nature Conservancy</a>.&nbsp; In exchange, the landowner not only gets the satisfaction of saving their land from eventually being paved over, but also gets a healthy tax deduction.</p>

<p>But this system of preserving land is far from ideal.&nbsp; John Echeverria of the Georgetown Environmental Law and Policy Institute has a concise summary of its &quot;<a href="http://www.law.georgetown.edu/gelpi/papers/topten.pdf">top ten</a>&quot; shortcomings, including these:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>1. Paying to stop unwise land use is </em>expensive<em>; paying for easements through the tax system makes the fiscal burden less visible, but it does not eliminate it.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>3. A voluntary approach does not address the central problem in environmental law, the </em>hold-out problem<em>; it creates the risk that a few irresponsible land owners will undermine efforts to achieve conservation goals at the landscape, watershed, or ecosystem level.</em></p>

<p><em>4. Voluntary conservation easements are likely to be </em>relatively ineffective<em>; those most likely to donate or sell easements voluntarily are likely to have little or no intention of changing land uses; those most likely to change land uses in the near future will be least likely to volunteer.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>10. The idea that landowners should conserve only when the taxpayer pays them conflicts with what Aldo Leopold called the imperative of developing an American “</em>land ethic<em>.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Echeverria's shortcoming number 7 points out that the current system of conservation easements, due to the difficulty of appraisal, the unique nature of each agreement, and the lack of public regulation of land trusts, the current system is ripe for abuse.</p>

<p>As a result of this occasional abuse, Congress is holding an <a href="http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20050606/NEWS/106060007">inquiry</a> into reforming the system:</p><blockquote><p><em>The U.S. Senate Finance Committee will put land
conservation tax laws under the microscope starting Wednesday. In the
worst-case scenario, it could eliminate a compelling incentive that
some ranchers, farmers and other landowners have to preserve their open
space rather than sell it to developers.</em></p>
<p><em>Critics of current tax
deduction regulations contend that the federal government is losing
millions of dollars due to questionable or downright dishonest
conservation efforts - like developers claiming deductions for
preserving some of their land as a golf course and reducing the number
of houses they build.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="http://www.hcn.org/servlets/hcn.Article?article_id=15533">High Country News</a> has an excellent series of articles on this subject, as it relates to the current pace of rapid development in the rural American west, in their current issue (available by subscription only unfortunately).&nbsp; These articles illustrate the potential for abuse, but also show that the vast majority of conservation easements are valid and worthwhile.</p><blockquote><p><em><p>
The basic easement documents, describing which activities are allowed
on each piece of land and which are not, are tucked away in the files
of the landowners, land trusts, county recorders’ offices, and many
other government offices. </p>

<p>
County and state agencies in Montana have computerized records and
mapping, but no one has a complete list or map of all the Montana
easements. The state’s Natural Resource Information System makes an
effort to collect easement information from other government offices
and land trusts. But the land trusts report only voluntarily, and the
government records are so scattered, &quot;My guess is that we probably have
90 to 95 percent of the (easement) acres, and maybe 75 percent of the
number of easements,&quot; says Allan Cox, who runs the agency’s mapping
program.
</p>

<p>The same goes in other states. And nationwide, the periodic
surveys of land trusts by the Land Trust Alliance, a Washington,
D.C.-based umbrella group, are similarly incomplete. The Alliance
totals only the acres that the trusts choose to report, and hundreds of
trusts don’t even respond to its surveys. The federal government
doesn’t know how many acres of easements its agencies oversee, either.
</p>

<p>
And the tax breaks are known only by the landowners, their accountants, the IRS, and sometimes, state revenue departments.
</p>

<p>The lack of public information, and of strict rules in the
system, has created an opportunity for abuse and led to calls for
reform. &quot;I’ve traveled around the country, meeting with land trust
people in almost every state, and they are good people who want to do
the right thing,&quot; says Small, a lawyer who now works on easement deals
around the country. &quot;Ninety-five percent of what’s been done (with
conservation easements) has been from excellent to good, or medium
good. Maybe 5 percent has been bad.&quot;</p></em></p></blockquote><p>Besides occasional abuse, one problem with the current system is that it is very beneficial to wealthy landowners, but, in most places, of little benefit to land-rich, cash-poor ranchers and farmers.&nbsp; The latter do not have enough income to take advantage of the full tax deductions.</p>

<p>Colorado has addressed this problem by giving state tax credits that can then be sold.&nbsp; With this program, a rancher can donate a conservation easement, preserving his or her land, and then sell the tax credits to a wealthy buyer.&nbsp; This wealthy buyer can then apply the credits to his or her tax bill.&nbsp; According to <a href="http://www.hcn.org/servlets/hcn.Article?article_id=15548">High Country News</a>, the buyer typically pays 90 cents for every dollar of tax credit.&nbsp; After middlemen take out some more money, the rancher typically ends up with 80 cents for every dollar of the original credit.</p>

<p>If Congress decides to reform the current federal system, hopefully they will use the opportunity to adopt a program with a similar goal—spreading the benefits of conservation easements beyond just those with the income to take advantage of the huge tax deductions.&nbsp; With the GOP running things, however, this is a longshot.&nbsp; </p>

<p>What is truly sad, though, is that a comprehensive program of land conservation addressing all, or even a few, of Echeverria's concerns is entirely out of the question in the current political landscape.&nbsp; How can we change that?</p>

                                <p>Bush's air pollution intiative that undermines the Clean Air Act, with its Orwellian name &quot;<a href="../../../2005/02/cloudy_skies.html">Clear Skies</a>,&quot;&nbsp; appeared dead in the U.S. Senate <a href="../../../2005/03/cloudy_skies_hi.html">earlier this year</a>.&nbsp; But it may have some legislative life after all, at least according to a brief article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/27/politics/27enviro.html">New York Times</a> today:</p><blockquote><p><em>President Bush's moribund air pollution initiative got unexpected life
on Thursday when the Environmental Protection Agency agreed to analyze
competing legislation, satisfying a months-old request from the Senate.</em></p>

<p><em>Efforts by a Senate committee to advance the White House measure,
known as Clear Skies, failed on a 9-to-9 vote in March after Senator
Thomas R. Carper, a Delaware Democrat who voted against it, complained
that the agency had been unwilling to examine his bill and several
others, all of which set tighter emission standards than those in the
administration measure.</em></p>

<p><em>Eight Democrats and one Republican,
Senator Lincoln Chaffee of Rhode Island, voted against the White House
plan while nine Republicans voted for it.</em></p>

<p><em>But in a House
subcommittee hearing on Clear Skies on Thursday, James L. Connaughton,
the chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said
the agency had agreed to analyze all the competing bills.</em></p>

<p><em>While
satisfying the request was no assurance that Mr. Carper would support
Mr. Bush's initiative, it could persuade another Democrat, perhaps
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who has been under pressure from
interest groups in his state to support the administration bill, to
change his vote.</em></p></blockquote><p>What are these interest groups in Montana supposedly pressuring <a href="http://www.eande.tv/transcripts/?date=021805">Baucus</a>?&nbsp; A March article by <a href="http://www.cleanairwatch.org/">Clear Air Watch</a>'s <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/a_clear_skies_smokescreen.php">Frank O'Donnell</a> gives us a hint:</p><blockquote><p><em>In a blatant bid to buy Baucus’ vote, [Oklahoma Senator James] Inhofe introduced a new draft of the bill with special privileges for a Montana coal mine.</em></p></blockquote><p>Fortunately, it appears that didn't work, at least by itself, since Baucus hasn't switched his vote.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For more background on this issue, and why 'Clear Skies' is such couterproductive legislation, I strongly recommend reading O'Donnell's full <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/a_clear_skies_smokescreen.php">article</a>.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Chris Mooney, a journalist who writes about science and politics for various national magazines, including The American Prospect and Mother Jones, is normally a very compelling&nbsp; and thorough writer.&nbsp; That is why I've enjoyed reading his articles and his blog, <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp">The Intersection</a>, for quite a while.&nbsp; For instance, he was the first member of the press that I know of to understand and expose the Bushies' and their allies' consistent, misleading uses of the phrases &quot;sound science&quot; and &quot;junk science.&quot;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, his new <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=9656">article</a> about the re-discovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker is less than convincing.&nbsp; The thesis is that we don't deserve to feel good about this remarkable event because some species are still extinct, some are endangered, and the Interior deparment is run by scoundrels.&nbsp; Certainly all these latter things are true and widely understood, but Mooney does not make the case for the connection with how we should feel about the ivory-billed woodpecker finding, and thus instead gives the impression of being a party-pooper.</p>

<p>Mooney tries to argue that the fact that some endangered species get more public attention than others is a problem.&nbsp; He even gives it a name:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><em><span class="summary">The charisma problem -- the fact that humans
arbitrarily value some creatures over others -- permeates attempts to
rehabilitate endangered species in the United States. It fueled the
dedication with which we fought to protect the spotted owl (a zeal
hardly to be detected in defense of the slick spot peppergrass). It
explains why we pat ourselves on the back so much to see populations of
bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and brown pelicans rebounding.
Meanwhile, a species that by all accounts ought to be deemed more than
heroic enough to save -- the Florida panther, of which less than a
hundred are left in the wild -- has been continually threatened by
encroaching development and lax regulations based on poor data.</span></em></p></blockquote><p>In this argument, Mooney misses the point behind the fight over the spotted owl back in the early 1990s.&nbsp; The passion in that battle was not for the owl; it was for its rapidly-shrinking habitat—old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; The owl was and is an indicator species, representing the health of its entire ecosystem.&nbsp; In this example, the owl's charisma was the antithesis of a problem; instead, it was an opportunity to be taken advantage of to help save many more species.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The difficulties of the Florida panther also fail to demonstrate that there is a charisma problem.&nbsp; Certainly if any animal is charismatic, a panther is.&nbsp; And the recovering populations of bald eagles, peregrine falcons, and brown pelicans hardly indicate any problem.&nbsp; Especially since without the charisma of creatures like these, there would be no Endangered Species Act at all, and where would that leave the slick spot peppergrass?&nbsp; So again, the charisma of certain species appears to be more of an opportunity than a problem.</p>

<p>In the midst of this unconvincing argument, Mooney uses imagery designed to
equate enthusiasm about birds and about nature in general with a
religious belief.&nbsp; This is a frame used frequently in recent years by
the right-wing to denigrate
environmentalists as &quot;nature worshippers,&quot; and hence as not like &quot;ordinary people.&quot;&nbsp; So it is surprising to
find Mooney propagating it.&nbsp; He calls the finding of the ivory-bill a
&quot;revelation,&quot; equates the bird to &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; and calls birding
field guides &quot;the Bible&quot; and &quot;Scripture.&quot;&nbsp; He also labels attempts to save the bird's
remaining habitat as &quot;charismatic creature worship.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mooney is clearly not purposefully
passing pejorative right-wing frames, since he is an avid birder himself.&nbsp; Yet his attempt to be clever not
only fails, it grates.</p>

<p>Despite my criticism of this short essay, I highly value much of Mooney's other work, and so don't want to end this post negatively.&nbsp; For a much better, more typical example of his work, see the article &quot;<a href="http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/6/mooney-science.asp">Blinded By Science</a>:&nbsp; How 'Balanced' Coverage Lets the Scientific Fringe Hijack Reality&quot; in the Columbia Journalism Review.&nbsp; Or see &quot;<a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=9556">A Cherry-Picking Accident</a>: Senator Inhofe should be more careful in deciding which scientific reports to misrepresent&quot; in the American Prospect.</p>

<p>UPDATE (5/12):&nbsp; Part of this post inspired a <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp?Id=1810">question</a> from Chris Mooney yesterday about literary sensibility.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Carl Pope, Executive Director of the Sierra Club, <a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/carlpope/2005/04/nail-biting-on-arctic.asp">reports</a> on the status of the GOP legislative attempt to drill for oil in the <a href="../../../2005/03/the_geography_o.html">Arctic National Wildlife Refuge</a>.&nbsp; Apparently there is at least some hope that the budget that contains this can be defeated in the House later today.&nbsp; Even if not, there is hope to defeat it later in the year.</p><blockquote><p><em>The House leadership is desperately scrambling to find enough votes to
pass a budget that would allow drilling the Arctic. Right now, they
don't have the votes -- they are meeting in Caucus and sharing the
proposal they have put together, so there are some details we still
await. ... Over on the Senate
side, swing Senators like Susan Collins are hoping that the final deal
will not include Arctic drilling, but I think they are likely to be
disappointed -- although if the House, which votes first, kills the
budget, as it looks at this moment like it might do tonight, the
Senators will be off the hook. Even if we lose today, the final and
decisive round will still come in September on Budget Reconciliation
but, if we win today, the Arctic is safe for another year, and probably
until the next elections.
</em></p></blockquote>

UPDATE:  Well, that hope was dashed.  The budget with drilling in it
passed by 3 votes according to Pope's update.

WASHINGTON - 
Amid the backdrop of soaring oil and gasoline prices, a sharply divided
Senate on Wednesday voted to open the ecologically rich Alaska wildlife
refuge to oil drilling, delivering a major energy policy win for
President Bush.</em></p>

<p>
<em>The Senate, by a 51-49 vote, rejected an
attempt by Democrats and GOP moderates to remove a refuge drilling
provision from next year's budget, preventing opponents from using a
filibuster — a tactic that has blocked repeated past attempts to open
the Alaska refuge to oil companies.</em></p>

<p>
<em>The action, assuming Congress agrees on a
budget, clears the way for approving drilling in the refuge later this
year, drilling supporters said. </em></p>

<p>
<em>The oil industry has sought for more than
two decades to get access to what is believed to be billions of barrels
of oil beneath the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge in the northern eastern corner of Alaska. </em></p>

<p>
<em>Environmentalists have fought such
development and argued that despite improve environmental controls a
web of pipelines and drilling platforms would harm calving caribou,
polar bears and millions of migratory birds that use the coastal plain.
</em></p></blockquote><p>I have none of my own words to express my dismay at this action by our alleged leaders.&nbsp; So I will turn to the immortal words of Wallace Stegner's &quot;<a href="http://www.wilderness.org/OurIssues/Wilderness/wildernessletterintro.cfm">Wilderness Letter</a>&quot; from 1960.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Something will have gone out of us as a people if we ever let the
remaining wilderness be destroyed; if we permit the last virgin forests
to be turned into comic books and plastic cigarette cases; if we drive
the few remaining members of the wild species into zoos or to
extinction; if we pollute the last clear air and dirty the last clean
streams and push our paved roads through the last of the silence, so
that never again will Americans be free in their own country from the
noise, the exhausts, the stinks of human and automotive waste. And so
that never again can we have the chance to see ourselves single,
separate, vertical and individual in the world, part of the environment
of trees and rocks and soil, brother to the other animals, part of the
natural world and competent to belong in it. Without any remaining
wilderness we are committed wholly, without chance for even momentary
reflection and rest, to a headlong drive into our technological
termite-life, the Brave New World of a completely man-controlled
environment. We need wilderness preserved--as much of it as is still
left, and as many kinds--because it was the challenge against which our
character as a people was formed. The reminder and the reassurance that
it is still there is good for our spiritual health even if we never
once in ten years set foot in it. It is good for us when we are young,
because of the incomparable sanity it can bring briefly, as vacation
and rest, into our insane lives. It is important to us when we are old
simply because it is there--important, that is, simply as an idea.</p>

<p>We are a wild species, as Darwin pointed out. Nobody ever tamed or
domesticated or scientifically bred us. But for at least three
millennia we have been engaged in a cumulative and ambitious race to
modify and gain control of our environment, and in the process we have
come close to domesticating ourselves. Not many people are likely, any
more, to look upon what we call &quot;progress&quot; as an unmixed blessing. Just
as surely as it has brought us increased comfort and more material
goods, it has brought us spiritual losses, and it threatens now to
become the Frankenstein that will destroy us. One means of sanity is to
retain a hold on the natural world, to remain, insofar as we can, good
animals. Americans still have that chance, more than many peoples; for
while we were demonstrating ourselves the most efficient and ruthless
environment-busters in history, and slashing and burning and cutting
our way through a wilderness continent, the wilderness was working on
us. It remains in us as surely as Indian names remain on the land. If
the abstract dream of human liberty and human dignity became, in
America, something more than an abstract dream, mark it down at least
partially to the fact that we were in subdued ways subdued by what we
conquered.</p>

<p>The Connecticut Yankee, sending likely candidates from King Arthur's
unjust kingdom to his Man Factory for rehabilitation, was
over-optimistic, as he later admitted. These things cannot be forced,
they have to grow. To make such a man, such a democrat, such a believer
in human individual dignity, as Mark Twain himself, the frontier was
necessary, Hannibal and the Mississippi and Virginia City, and reaching
out from those the wilderness; the wilderness as opportunity and idea,
the thing that has helped to make an American different from and, until
we forget it in the roar of our industrial cities, more fortunate than
other men. For an American, insofar as he is new and different at all,
is a civilized man who has renewed himself in the wild. The American
experience has been the confrontation by old peoples and cultures of a
world as new as if it had just risen from the sea. That gave us our
hope and our excitement, and the hope and excitement can be passed on
to newer Americans, Americans who never saw any phase of the frontier.
But only so long as we keep the remainder of our wild as a reserve and
a promise--a sort of wilderness bank.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Let me say something on the subject of the kinds of wilderness worth
preserving. Most of those areas contemplated are in the national
forests and in high mountain country. For all the usual recreational
purposes, the alpine and the forest wildernesses are obviously the most
important, both as genetic banks and as beauty spots. But for the
spiritual renewal, the recognition of identity, the birth of awe, other
kinds will serve every bit as well. Perhaps, because they are less
friendly to life, more abstractly nonhuman, they will serve even
better. On our Saskatchewan prairie, the nearest neighbor was four
miles away, and at night we saw only two lights on all the dark
rounding earth. The earth was full of animals--field mice, ground
squirrels, weasels, ferrets, badgers, coyotes, burrowing owls, snakes.
I knew them as my little brothers, as fellow creatures, and I have
never been able to look upon animals in any other way since. The sky in
that country came clear down to the ground on every side, and it was
full of great weathers, and clouds, and winds, and hawks. I hope I
learned something from looking a long way, from looking up, from being
much alone. A prairie like that, one big enough to carry the eye clear
to the sinking, rounding horizon, can be as lonely and grand and simple
in its forms as the sea. It is as good a place as any for the
wilderness experience to happen; the vanishing prairie is as worth
preserving for the wilderness idea as the alpine forest.</p>

<p>So are great reaches of our western deserts, scarred somewhat by
prospectors but otherwise open, beautiful, waiting, close to whatever
God you want to see in them. Just as a sample, let me suggest the
Robbers' Roost country in Wayne County, Utah, near the Capitol Reef
National Monument. In that desert climate the dozer and jeep tracks
will not soon melt back into the earth, but the country has a way of
making the scars insignificant. It is a lovely and terrible wilderness,
such as wilderness as Christ and the prophets went out into; harshly
and beautifully colored, broken and worn until its bones are exposed,
its great sky without a smudge of taint from Technocracy, and in hidden
corners and pockets under its cliffs the sudden poetry of springs. Save
a piece of country like that intact, and it does not matter in the
slightest that only a few people every year will go into it. That is
precisely its value. Roads would be a desecration, crowds would ruin
it. But those who haven't the strength or youth to go into it and live
can simply sit and look. They can look two hundred miles, clear into
Colorado: and looking down over the cliffs and canyons of the San
Rafael Swell and the Robbers' Roost they can also look as deeply into
themselves as anywhere I know. And if they can't even get to the places
on the Aquarius Plateau where the present roads will carry them, they
can simply contemplate the idea, take pleasure in the fact that such a
timeless and uncontrolled part of earth is still there.</p>

<p>These are some of the things wilderness can do for us. That is the
reason we need to put into effect, for its preservation, some other
principle that the principles of exploitation or &quot;usefulness&quot; or even
recreation. We simply need that wild country available to us, even if
we never do more than drive to its edge and look in. For it can be a
means of reassuring ourselves of our sanity as creatures, a part of the
geography of hope.</p></blockquote><p>UPDATE (2:07pm):&nbsp; Perhaps there is still some <a href="http://www.defenders.org/releases/pr2005/pr031605.html">hope</a> left for this particular part of the geography of hope.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp?Id=1661">Chris Mooney</a> lets us know that the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee deadlocked in a 9-9 tie on George Bush's Cloudy Skies initiative, which I wrote about in some <a href="../../../2005/02/cloudy_skies.html">detail</a> a few weeks ago.&nbsp; GOP Senator Lincoln Chafee joined Independent Jim Jeffords and seven Democrats to put a temporary halt on this anti-environmental bill.</p>

<p>According to this informative Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20314-2005Mar9.html">article</a>, Cloudy Skies isn't dead yet, though it doesn't explain exactly how the GOP may be able to still yet bring it to the Senate floor.</p>

<p>An interesting tidbit from the article is that the committee chairman's (Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma) dismissive&nbsp; attitude toward global warming may be doing a lot to push Senator Chafee away from the administration's side on this issue, at least according to one of the bill's main proponents in the Senate:</p><blockquote><p><em><p>A central disagreement was whether the bill, originally aimed at reducing sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury pollution, should
also address global warming and carbon dioxide emissions. The issue
cost the Republican majority Chafee's crucial vote, said Sen George V.
Voinovich (R-Ohio).</p></em></p>

<p><em><p>
&quot;Chafee thinks this is the biggest problem facing the world, and the
chairman [Inhofe] has a sign in his office saying this is a hoax,&quot; said
Voinovich, as he threw up his hands today.</p></em></p></blockquote>
