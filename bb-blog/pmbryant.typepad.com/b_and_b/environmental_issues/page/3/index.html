		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The famous King Ranch, down near the Gulf coast south of Corpus Christi, has been waging a battle against wind power farms planned for its area&nbsp; </p>

<p>As a proponent of wind power and other sources of energy that reduce global warming emissions, that should make me an opponent of theirs.&nbsp; Then again, they are also waging a battle against Texas' tradition of unregulated development--the kind of tradition that has led to <a href="../../../2007/02/vested_rights_t.html">dynamite blasting</a> in residential areas and to the <a href="../../../2007/01/root_causes_of_.html">Helotes mulch fire</a>.&nbsp; As a witness to the damaging consequences of this tradition, perhaps I should be a supporter of the King Ranch in this case.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Indeed, wind power should not have an exemption from sensible regulation, so I am sympathetic to the King Ranch's proposed legislation--at least based on my understanding of it from this article in today's <a href="http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/03/28/28nowind.html">Austin American-Statesman</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">King Ranch Inc., the agricultural holding company that owns the South Texas ranch and other properties, is backing legislation that could choke off the boom in Texas wind energy by requiring new state regulations of wind turbines. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The state does not require permits in most cases for wind farms, which consist of hundreds of enormous turbines that generate electricity. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">That would change under House Bill 2794, sponsored by Rep. Robert Puente, D-San Antonio. The bill would require the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to establish a permit process to take into account the environmental consequences of wind turbines and whether the noise they create — or just the fact they're part of a once-unspoiled view — interferes with the property rights of nearby landowners. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">King Ranch has been fighting a proposed coastal wind project in Kenedy County, just east of its ranch, that would place 267 turbines along the Gulf's Laguna Madre. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;People need to take a deep breath and think a little,&quot; Jack Hunt, CEO of King Ranch Inc., said about the Texas wind rush. &quot;It's a frenzy.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>I suspect that, in the end, such a permit process would still permit most of the wind farms to be built.&nbsp; But it would allow ill-conceived plans to be prevented.</p>

<p>Like most land use regulation attempts in Texas, however, it looks like this bill stands little chance in our developer-friendly legislature.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson said opponents of wind energy won't succeed in the Legislature, either. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;The bill is dead because no one wants to pass it,&quot; said Patterson, who has leased state land for big offshore wind projects to generate more revenue for public education. &quot;This is the King Ranch versus the rest of Texas.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Patterson said the idea of siting requirements for wind turbines &quot;is not completely outside the realm of good public policy&quot; and is worth studying. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;But this bill isn't about being reasonable,&quot; he said.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p><span style="color: #000000;">Patterson may be correct that this isn't reasonable legislation, though I suspect his reasons for thinking so are not the same as mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;">The problem is not that wind turbines are exempt from sensible land use regulations, but that virtually no one is subject to sensible land use regulation.&nbsp; While in principle this legislation sounds like an excellent idea, wind farms strike me as far down the priority list on this matter.</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>At the science policy blog <a href="http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/prometheus/archives/climate_change/001143al_gores_appearance.html">Prometheus</a>, Kevin Vranes has an excellent rundown of Al Gore's congressional testimony today concerning actions we can take to address global warming, a.k.a. climate change, a.k.a. the climate crisis.</p>

<p>Notable excerpts:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">The biggest bombshell was his second proposal: <strong>eliminate employment/payroll taxes and replace the revenue with a new carbon/pollution tax</strong>. This is the first time I've heard Mr. Gore specifically endorse a carbon tax, which automatically gives it new life in the policy debate. But more startling is the proposed revenue offset by eliminating payroll taxes.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">As the hearing went on I started to focus more on the R's than the D's and I finally realized why: the D's have been on board for a while, but up to this point the R's have been stalling. They aren't any longer, and almost to a person the R's made loud and positive noises about accepting the science and wanting to do something about it. So I started wanting to hear the next R, to hear how he (no female R's on EPW right now) was positioning himself on climate change, knowing that the R's are playing catch up.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Sen. Lieberman (I-CT)</strong> made a point I've been pushing for a while: that we are already passed the political tipping point for movement on climate change. I think if you consider the rhetoric and tone of the debate both among the elected and in the press, we are passed a tipping point on moving on climate change. Lieberman made the point that we better get past that political tipping point before we hit the climatological tipping point, which I suppose is a reference to a sudden Atlantic meridional overturning shutdown (few believe this is an immediate threat). Gore, however, disagreed that we've reached a political tipping point. But if we are not yet passed a tipping point, that implies that we could still slide back down, forget about all this and do nothing on climate change. I don't think that's going to happen; I think action is inevitable.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Here is video of Gore's opening statements (found on YouTube via the blog <a href="https://coeruleus.blogspot.com/2007/03/gores-testimony-to-house-energy-science.html">She Flies With Her Own Wings</a>).</p><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/Yo7rmajxxnc" width="425" height="350" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent"></embed>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA031107.01B.Helotes_fire_folo.36231e2.html">This</a> can't be good:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">HELOTES — State environmental officials late Saturday ordered the debris fire near here doused with water to stanch air pollution from the smoldering months-old headache, saying the emergency conditions of befouled air no longer were binding them to an agreement with local officials not to use water. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">This came even as a massive crane arrived and was being employed at the site with last-ditch and, for the moment, dashed hopes it would remove the need for putting water on the fire.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Water from the site has been leaching into the groundwater and alarming San Antonio Water System officials, who see it as a major water pollution danger. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Top officials from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said in interviews Saturday that their move to vacate the agreement with SAWS to avoid spraying the fire came amid a 25-day period in which air pollution levels exceeded safety levels for children and the elderly on 23 of those days. </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;The air is not improving, and we have people in the Helotes area that are suffering,&quot; said John Steib, a top TCEQ enforcement official who was at the scene Saturday. Therefore, &quot;We are not operating under terms of the agreement.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Given the contamination of nearby wells even with the limited amounts of water used so far, if the Edwards aquifer emerges from this intact, it will just be a matter of luck.&nbsp; Of course, the air pollution around Helotes is also a travesty.&nbsp; But we should not compound one big problem with another, even bigger one.</p>

<p>Then again, Helotes mayor Jon Allen, now a strong advocate for dousing the fire with water, may have the consummate, if debatable, <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA031107.01B.KROD.362321a.html">words</a> on how this will be resolved:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">“You have a choice whether to drink the water in the aquifer. You don't have a choice to breathe the air.”</span></p></blockquote></blockquote>

                                <p>As the end of the Great Helotes Mulch Fire finally appears within sight, with the latest, low water, fire-fighting efforts apparently on track to <a href="http://www.ksat.com/news/11054113/detail.html">extinguishing</a> the two-month old blaze in the next few weeks, the giant smoking brush pile has gone national—making the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/19/AR2007021901023.html">Washington Post</a>, page A02:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">HELOTES, Tex. -- The smoke comes and goes with the breeze, but some days it blankets Deanna Rodriguez's neighborhood, covering cars in grimy ash and seeping inside homes. Some days, when the wind blows from the south, her house becomes almost uninhabitable.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;We can get the rugs cleaned, the furniture cleaned. My main concern is the kids,&quot; she said of her three children. &quot;They're breathing that in.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Rodriguez's neighborhood sits only a few hundred yards from a giant mulch fire that has burned, day and night, in a pasture in this small town west of San Antonio since just after Christmas.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">No one knows what caused the fire at the H.L. Zumwalt Tree Disposal's recycling facility eight weeks ago. But, the result is a smoldering pile of ash eight stories tall and hundreds of feet long that gives healthy adults and children headaches, irritated eyes, sore throats and other allergy-like symptoms, and threatens the frail even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Officials predict it will take at least three more weeks to extinguish the fire. Progress has been slow because the environmental officials in charge of putting out the fire have had to balance air-quality concerns in Helotes with protecting the sole water source for 1.8 million people in the region.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>The Dallas Morning-News also has a <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/localnews/columnists/jfloyd/stories/DN-floyd_20met.ART.State.Edition2.2040aae.html">column</a> on it, with a concise quote from Helotes Mayor Jon Allen:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;You know, this isn't just an isolated incident. It's a symptom. We're just not doing a very good job protecting the environment in Texas.&quot;</span> </p></blockquote></blockquote><p>As columnist Jacquilynn Floyd wrote, &quot;the only really good solution would have been to keep it from happening in the first place, and that horse left the barn a long time ago.&quot; </p>

<p>Finally, for any who may have missed it, last Thursday the San Antonio Express-News posted a spectacular photo essay on the Helotes mulch fire. Go to this <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA021507.1B.mulch.fire.1041e51.html">link</a>, scroll down, and click on the &quot;E-N slide show: The Helotes fire&quot; link. I heartily recommend it.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the spring of 2005, a panel of the National Research Council of the National Academies of Science, interrupted its designated work to warn that the system of satellites that scientists use to study how our planet works was in danger of collapse. I covered their report and its aftermath extensively at the time. (For a review, see this <a href="../../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">2005 post</a> and more posts <a href="../../../science_earth/index.html">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Now, nearly two years later, the panel has completed its work on prioritizing future needs for Earth-observing satellites. And it has included a very similar warning.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/15/science/space/15cnd-nasa.html?hp&amp;ex=1168923600&amp;en=2ecb181905efaab0&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage">New York Times</a> today: </p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">The nation’s ability to track retreating polar ice, shifting patterns of drought, winds and rainfall and other environmental changes is being put “at great risk” by faltering efforts to replace aging satellite-borne sensors, a panel convened by the country’s leading scientific advisory group said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">By 2010, the number of operating earth-observing instruments on NASA satellites, most of which are already past their planned lifetimes, will likely drop by 40 percent, the National Research Council of the National Academies warned in a report today.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The weakening of these monitoring efforts comes even as many scientists and the Bush administration have been stressing their growing importance, both to clarify risks from global warming and natural hazards and to track the condition of forests, fisheries, water and other resources on an increasingly crowded planet.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Several prominent scientists welcomed the report, saying that while the overall tightening of the federal budget played a role in threatening earth-observing efforts, a significant contributor was also President Bush’s recent call for NASA to focus on manned space missions.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">“NASA has a mission ordering that starts with the presidential goals -- first of manned flight to Mars, and second establishing a permanent base on the moon, and then third to examine Earth, which puts Earth rather far down on the totem pole,” said F. Sherwood Rowland, an atmospheric chemist at the University of California at Irvine, who shared a Nobel prize for identifying threats to the ozone layer.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">“This is the most critical time in human history, with the population never before so big and with stresses growing on the earth,” [co-chairman of the committee that wrote the report and the new president of the American Meteorological Society, Dr. Richard] Anthes said. “We just want to get back to the United States being a leader instead of someone you can’t count on.”</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>In addition to preventing a degradation in our ability to forecast such potentially devastating events, the report reiterates that a strong system of Earth-observing satellites is imperative to help address the questions that those of many of us stuck here on the planet Earth will find crucial to our future well-being. Their list of key questions includes:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Will there be catastrophic collapse of the major ice sheets, including Greeland and West Antarctic, and, if so, how rapidly will this occur? What will be the time patterns of sea level rise as a result?</li>

<li>Will droughts become more widespread in the western U.S., Australia, and Sub Saharan Africa? ... How will reduced amounts of snowfall change the needs for water storage?</li>

<li>How will continuing economic development affect the production of air pollutants, and how will these pollutants be transported across oceans and continents?</li>

<li>How will coastal and ocean ecosystems respond to changes in physical forcing, particularly those subject to intense human harvesting?</li>

<li>Will tropical cyclones and heat waves become more frequent and more intense?</li></ul></blockquote><p>The full report is already <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html">online</a>, and I plan to post more about this when I have the chance to examine it in more detail. But here is one ominous statement from the Executive Summary (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>[T]here is substantial concern that substitution of passive microwave sensor data for active scatterometry data will <strong>worsen El Nino and hurricane forecasts</strong> and weather forecasts in coastal areas.</p></blockquote><p>Not only failing to improve hurricane forecasts, but worsening them?&nbsp; This is not a situation that, in the wake of Katrina, we be permit. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>During the six years I lived in California, the Owens Valley came to hold a special place in my heart. Though I have not set foot in it for over ten years, it still does. So, while in the midst of the final days of the Ciro Rodriguez campaign a month ago, I was pleased to hear some exciting news regarding this valley's river, whose water has until now been virtually completely siphoned off into an aqueduct to flow south to distant Los Angeles — High Sierra water is flowing again in the lower Owens River for the first time in nearly a century!</p>

<p>The Owens Valley is a 10,000-foot deep, spectacularly scenic valley in the rain shadow of the high peaks of the Sierra Nevada. Despite its lack of precipitation, it contains a major river that drains the prodigious snows of these mountains. This river's water was tapped in the early 1900s by the city of Los Angeles's Department of Water and Power (DWP) in a notorious feat of underhandedness and engineering -- piping the river's water over hundreds of miles of desert to fuel the city's growth.</p>

<p>Over the years, the residents of the Owens Valley fought back against Los Angeles, at times sabotaging the aqueduct to attempt to save the water for their own agricultural ambitions. Over the years, they lost battle after battle after battle. The large, shallow Owens Lake at the south end of the valley soon dried up, leaving a vast plain of salt deposits that blow up a toxic storm in the desert winds.</p>

<p>Eventually, Los Angeles, in its quest for even more water, extended the aquifer north to tap into the creeks that fed Mono Lake, causing that lake, too, to slowly dry up. That wasn't enough. It later increased the capacity of the Owens River aqueduct and even pumped the groundwater out from under the Owens Valley.</p>

<p>All that was left of the century-old dreams of an agricultural empire in the shadow on Mt. Whitney was a vast open dessicated desert valley, whose life-sustaining water silently flowed down a contrete ditch south to a distant megalopolis.</p>

<p>Starting in 1994, though, the tide began to turn, if only just a little. After a long battle by activists to prevent the death of the fascinating ecosystem at Mono Lake, a state agency ordered L.A. to limit its intake of the lake's feeder creeks and allow the lake to rise to a level that would allow it to live on.</p>

<p>In recent years, he city has also been forced to limit its groundwater pumping and re-water a small portion of the dry bed of Owens Lake to help cut down on the severity of the dust storms.</p>

<p>Now, Los Angeles has been forced to return a fraction of the water flow to the bed of the Owens River itself. The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-owens7dec07,0,3020398.story?coll=la-home-headlines">Los Angeles Times</a> reported on December 7:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">Against a backdrop of lofty snowcapped peaks, about 500 spectators, led by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, gathered Wednesday [December 6] to watch the Lower Owens River ripple anew with its first surge of High Sierra water in nearly a century.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The largest river habitat restoration effort ever attempted in the West was jump-started at 12:15 p.m., when Villaraigosa turned a control knob to open a new clamshell-shaped steel gate at a diversion dam that has been directing the waters that have flowed into the Los Angeles Aqueduct since 1913.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">By the time Villaraigosa was heading home in a chartered jet after the hourlong ceremony, the water had traveled roughly half a mile, meandering around a bend, past clots of dusty sagebrush.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">It will sweep past the skeletal gray arms of dead cottonwood trees, and through dry zones and broad spring-fed beaver ponds choked with cattails and harboring largemouth bass and catfish, which are expected to spawn hordes of fish in the rehabilitated river.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The water will take about 16 days to traverse the vast Owens Valley floodplain flanked by the High Sierra on the west and the White and Inyo mountains on the east, and pour into storage ponds on the northern edge of the dry Owens Lake.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">There, four 600-horsepower pumps will draw the water up and put it back into the aqueduct's ribbon of concrete and steel for transport to Los Angeles, about 250 miles to the south.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">If all goes according to plan, within five years nature will transform the revived river's lazy loops into an oasis of willows and cottonwood trees; wetlands for waterfowl and shorebirds, and warm water fisheries for bass, catfish, frogs and crayfish.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Los Angeles, despite all the good feelings in its rhetoric, still had to be forced to do the right thing by a state judge fining them over $2 million -- quite a bit resistance for an action that &quot;is not expected to result in a significant loss of water or in a rate hike for DWP customers.&quot; Still, L.A. and the DWP appear to finally be on the right track.</p>

<p>An article in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/19/AR2006121901660.html">Washington Post</a> from just before the holidays reminds us what has made this sea change possible (emphasis added):</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">The city's water <strong>conservation efforts</strong> have been some of the most successful in the nation; over the past 20 years, while Los Angeles has added 750,000 homes, its water consumption has remained the same. Its water commission used to be dominated by urban boosters, but with time, environmentalists invaded its ranks.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Finally, the DWP itself has changed. &quot;It used to be all engineers,&quot; said Prather, &quot;but now they have biologists and wildlife managers.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>I am looking forward to returning one day to the Owens Valley and seeing what the process of its ecologic revival looks like.</p>

		<a href="../../../2006/12/aguas_sues_to_p.html">AGUA sues feds to protect Golden-cheeked warbler habitat and the Edwards aquifer</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Aquifer Guardians in Urban Areas (<a href="http://aquiferguardians.org/">AGUA</a>), a San Antonio-based group interested in the protection of the Edwards Aquifer and the land that feeds it, has recently filed a lawsuit charging that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have violated the Endangered Species Act by permitting the construction of an electric transmission line through Golden-cheeked Warbler habitat in northwest Bexar County. Golden-cheeked Warblers are an endangered bird that nests exclusively in central Texas.</p>

<p>From the AGUA <a href="http://aquiferguardians.org/fwssuit.htm">website</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">In particular, the suit claims that the biological opinion prepared by the Service did not follow federal rules and that the cumulative loss of Golden-cheeked warbler habitat has not been fully and fairly considered. The suit asks that the permit decision be set aside and that a plan be developed and implemented to set aside enough acreage to protect the warbler.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>AGUA also reports that &quot;Much of the local habitat has already been eliminated due to suburban developments, especially in the area from Austin to San Antonio.&quot; Living in this area, the truth of this is self-evident to me, as I see more and more sections of Hill Country terrain bulldozed and scraped to bedrock every week. It is extremely painful to watch — the slow-motion death of the land we have come to love.</p>

<p>This destruction of land is likely to bring with it the degradation of the principle water source for this entire area, the Edwards Aquifer, as the runoff from this land is what feeds the aquifer. This is the reason that a group like AGUA is concerned with habitat for an endangered bird. AGUA President Enrique Valdivia was quoted in the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA122206.01B.warblersuit.2efae9d.html">Express-News</a> last week: &quot;We believe that the warbler is an indicator of the health of the environment and the Edwards Aquifer. Our focus is really to protect the Edwards Aquifer.&quot;</p>

		<a href="../../../2006/12/update_on_san_a.html">Update on San Antonio's preservation of land to protect the Edwards Aquifer</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Back in 2005, <a href="../../../2005/05/san_antonio_vot.html">San Antonio voters</a> approved an extension of a 1/8-cent sales tax to be used to purchase land in the recharge zone for the Edwards Aquifer. The goal is to prevent over-development of that land and thus preserve the quality of the water in the underground reservoir that supplies the vast majority of this city's water.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4408985.html">Houston Chronicle</a> has an update on what is being done with these funds.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">It's some of the most picturesque land around this sprawling city: 116 acres of craggy, oak-covered hills near the Government Canyon State Natural Area.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The city bought the acreage in September with nearly $1 million in taxpayer funds — not for parkland but to shield it from development and preserve its role in replenishing the Edwards Aquifer.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The tracts were the first of many being acquired with proceeds from a one-eighth-cent sales tax approved by local voters last year to raise $90 million for water-related land conservation. Most of the acquisitions are likely to be in recharge zone areas of rural Medina and Uvalde counties, where land is cheaper than in heavily urbanized Bexar County.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;This is one of the largest, most significant conservation projects in the entire state right now,&quot; said Deirdre Hisler, who leads the city advisory board implementing Proposition 1.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Rather than buy land, the city prefers to seek easements that impose restrictions on the owners' use of the property but keeps it on the tax rolls.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;We only deal with willing landowners that are willing to be a part of the program,&quot; and there is no shortage of interest, Hisler said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Jeff Francell, director of land protection at the Texas Nature Conservancy, said San Antonio's initiative &quot;is going to have a major impact in the future on water quality, on protection of the aquifer and sprawl, to some degree.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">By seeking easements in Medina and Uvalde counties, &quot;we're going to be able to protect tens of thousands of acres with the $90 million,&quot; Francell said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;We're talking about land that is in the $1,000-$3,000 an acre range rather than in the $20,000-$50,000 an acre range in Bexar County,&quot; Francell said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The effort should benefit anyone who visits, not just San Antonians, he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;A lot of Houston hunts in this area. Just keeping it open for wildlife is an added benefit,&quot; he said.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>This effort is just one small part of what will be needed to ensure that our quality of life in south and central Texas is preserved in the decades to come.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/008509.html">Off the Kuff</a> also comments on this article, taking issue with the Texas Nature Conservancy's Francell's comment, &quot;The state parks don't have two cents to rub together now. Private buyers are the only hope.&quot;</p>

<p>Kuffner writes, &quot;Restoring, or in this case not restoring, those cuts [to state parks budget], is also a choice. Maybe that's a choice you agree with, but it's still a choice. We could choose differently, and that's why Francell's statement about private trusts being the &quot;only hope&quot; is wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>I agree that Francell's statement is wrong, but only because he left out local initiatives such as San Antonio's Proposition 1.&nbsp; At the state government level, I believe Francell is on target, even given the likelihood of increased state parks budgets in the short term (a subject I will be posting about very soon).&nbsp; </p>

<p>It is inconceivable to me that a state run by Republicans whose ideology and campaign contributors incline them towards underfunding and even selling off state parks is going to embark upon a land acquisition binge any time soon.&nbsp; And what limited land acquisition by the state we may be fortunate enough to see will likely follow the <a href="../../../2005/05/just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon example</a> of public-private partnerships -- where the Trust for Public Land, and other private organizations, were instrumental in assembling what is now a showpiece of the state parks system.</p>

<p>So, for the foreseeable future, private land trusts and local initiatives such as San Antonio's Proposition 1 appear to be the only substantial hope for preserving undeveloped land.&nbsp; Of course, I would love to be proved wrong on this.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There is a new paper out in Science magazine that purports to cast doubt on the last year's celebrated rediscovery of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker in the forests of Arkansas. The first author is David Sibley, renowned birding author and artist. Sibley's target—the brief, blurry video, shot by David Luneau in 2004, that is the only photographic evidence yet presented for the woodpecker's modern existence. Sibley and his co-authors argue that the bird seen in that video is, in fact, a common Pileated Woodpecker.</p>

<p>In response to this new paper, some of my favorite bird bloggers are giving up on the Ivory-billed. GrrlScientist at Living the Scientific Life wrote a post titled, &quot;<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2006/03/goodbye_beautiful_dream.php">Goodbye Beautiful Dream</a>&quot;, saying, &quot;This bird's existence becomes less credible, more tenuous, with every passing day.&quot; Nuthatch at <a href="http://www.bootstrap-analysis.com/2006/03/sibleys_science.html">Boostrap Analysis</a> wrote, &quot;In the world of science, a situation of this nature would generally be considered to be at the 'back to the drawing board' stage. And I think that's where the IBWO is at. Still awaiting rediscovery.&quot;</p>

<p>After reading the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/311/5767/1555a.pdf">Sibley</a> paper, and the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/311/5767/1555b.pdf">response</a> to it written by the team that announced the original re-discovery last year, I am not so ready to give up. In fact, reading once again the evidence that the Cornell team led by John Fitzpatrick has put together, as well as their comprehensive analysis of the grainy video, I am impressed anew at the strength of their case. In comparison, the analysis by Sibley and his collaborators appears incomplete—their conclusions, therefore, unconvincing.</p>

<p>I have only yet briefly perused the evidence on both sides at this point, so my opinions may evolve. But right now, I am troubled by the tendency of Sibley and his collaborators to casually dismiss evidence contradicting the pileated hypothesis and supporting the ivory-billed hypothesis. </p>

<p>To take one example, Fitzpatrick's team has suggestive evidence that the fast wingbeats and direct flight-pattern of the bird in the video is far more consistent with the ivory-billed hypothesis than the pileated. Sibley dismisses this in one sentence at the end of his paper: &quot;We agree that 'we lack sufficiently comparable data for objective comparison' of these features.&quot; He and his co-authors spend a little more space on this subject in the supplemental materials, stating that &quot;identification based on the wingbeat rate of the bird in the Arkansas video requires clear evidence both that it can be matched by an ivory-billed woodpecker and that it cannot be matched by a pileated woodpecker.&quot; </p>

<p>The wingbeat rate of ivory-billeds is unknown, but the Cornell team has presented suggestive historical evidence that it is similar to the wingbeat rate of the bird in the video. The wingbeat rate of pileateds should be simple to measure, since they are so common. But Sibley's group has apparently made no effort to study this. The Cornell group, on the other hand, has looked into this issue and reports on their <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/ivory/rediscovery/support/frequency/document_view">web site</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The wingbeat frequencies of Pileated Woodpeckers in our videos from Arkansas are 2-4 beats per second in level flight (many examples) and 4-7.5 beats for short periods during hasty departures (n = 5). Moreover, experts who have studied Pileated Woodpecker flight using video analysis timed the fastest departures at 7 beats per sec (Tobalske 1996, personal communication). Thus, wingbeat frequency of the woodpecker in the Luneau video [8.6 per second] is faster than any recorded Pileated Woodpecker.</em></p></blockquote><p>Sibley's case would be more persuasive if he took this evidence contradicting his hypothesis more seriously. On this point, this is not a mere argument over the precise placement and color of a few pixels in a fuzzy image. </p><p>As another example, Sibley and his co-authors gloss over the substantial amount of non-video evidence that the Cornell team published a year ago.</p><blockquote><p><em>The recent sight records (1, 4) were all very brief and most involved a single observer, matching the pattern of reported observations over the past few decades (5–8). Although such observations provide strong impetus for continued searching and habitat protection, they cannot be taken to confirm the species' presence because they do not provide independently verifiable evidence.</em></p></blockquote><p>The Cornell team, naturally, does not take lightly this casual dismissal of the bulk of the evidence bolstering their case. They write, in a footnote in their response to Sibley's paper:</p><blockquote><p><em>Sibley et al. (2) incorrectly claim that the sight records we reported (1, 10) ‘‘were all very brief and most involved a single observer, matching the pattern of reported observations over the past few decades.’’ In no case since the 1940s was a report of an ivory-billed woodpecker (such as the original one by Gene Sparling) promptly followed by multiple repeat sightings in the same area—sightings that included a close encounter shared by two individuals, each having extensive experience with pileated woodpeckers in southern forests. After studying the evidence at length, the Bird Records Committee of the Arkansas Audubon Society voted unanimously to accept the documentation of ivorybilled woodpecker (www.arbirds.org/ivory_billed_woodpecker.html). Comparable validation by critical and experienced local experts has not occurred following any previous report of this species.</em></p></blockquote><p>No one would give a hoot about this video if there hadn't been so many other sightings by so many experienced individuals in the same area in a short span of time. By not acknowledging the significance of these sightings, Sibley shortchanges his own argument.</p><p>This whole controversy should be moot relatively soon. With the exhaustive nature of the search that has been going on in the Arkansas woods this winter, if the Ivory-billed Woodpecker inhabits those forests, there should be plenty more circumstantial evidence soon forthcoming. If no such evidence is presented over the next few months, then strong skepticism of the continued existence of the ivory-billed will be more than justified.</p>

                                <p>In addition to NASA and NOAA, the Environmental Protection Agency has its own issue with allowing scientists to talk directly to the public. And, unlike the other agencies, the EPA is not even pretending to change its policy.</p><p>On February 9, as Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) <a href="http://www.peer.org/news/news_id.php?row_id=645">discovered</a>, the EPA's news director for research and development, Ann Brown, sent an email to all staff saying:</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;We are asked to remind all employees that EPA's standard media procedure is to refer all media queries regarding ORD [Office of Research and Development] to Ann Brown, ORD News Director, prior to agreeing to or conducting any interviews. The purpose of this policy is to enable the Agency to clarify the request, and to ensure that the reporter talks with appropriate experts on science, budget, or administrative issues. Support for this policy also will allow reasonable time for appropriate management response.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>The timing is suggestive, coming several days <em>after</em> the <a href="../../../2006/02/nasa_humiliated.html">George Deutsch</a> flap at NASA became public. Who asked Ann Brown to remind EPA scientists that, unlike NASA, their policy wasn't going to change?</p><p>I suspect they are connected to the people who propose to cut the EPA's <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/3294/1/1?TopicID=1">library budget</a> by 80%—cuts that, left intact, would leave both the agency's staff and the general public &quot;without useful access to the agency's vast storehouse of information.&quot;</p>
