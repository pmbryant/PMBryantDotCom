                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Over the weekend, the San Antonio Express-News published a revealing <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA012206.01A.Schaefer_Lawsuits.356ac02.html">article</a> about how the governmental system in Texas is rigged vastly in the favor of real-estate developers over the needs and desires of the communities of our state.</p>

<p>In short, no matter what laws a community may pass to attempt to regulate and control how it develops for the benefit of its citizens, real estate developers can do whatever they please.  All thanks to what a legal concept so unobtrusively called "vested rights."</p>

<p>The scenario from Sunday's article is sadly typical, as revealed in a <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA101605.1A.vested.main.3d67547.html">four-part</a> Express-News report from last October.  (1) City wants developer to abide by laws passed roughly a decade ago that require developer to be a good neighbor.  (2) Developer objects to obeying current laws and waves around vague 30-year old documents from a previous owner of the land describing a completely different project, claiming that these ancient forms exempt the developer from current law.  (3) A governmental entity, beaurocrat or judge, approves the developer's objection thanks to the Texas state law concept of "vested rights."    (4) Land development proceeds, making oodles of money for the developer at the expense of the citizens of the community whose laws he has just flouted.  </p>

<p>In the specific case reported on Sunday, the developer is John Schaefer and the city is San Antonio.<blockquote><em>The 27 acres of plowed earth that Schaefer and city lawyers are skirmishing over lies on the rapidly growing Northeast Side. </p>

<p>Bernard said the city asked Schaefer's engineer to prove that plans for the dense, 150-home development on Crestway Road wouldn't dramatically increase storm-water runoff flowing to a dam on Martinez Creek. </p>

<p>But Schaefer felt the property was already designed to handle the runoff and didn't want to follow the city's 1997 drainage ordinance. <br />
The rules require developers to either pay fees earmarked for flood-control projects, or set aside valuable land for basins that impede runoff. </p>

<p>Schaefer said he didn't have to follow those requirements because of a 1971 planning document known as a plat that had been filed by a previous landowner. </p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The 1971 plat in Schaefer's possession only showed the contours of the property, giving no indication of what was supposed to be built. </p>

<p>Schaefer and his engineer said that didn't matter. </p>

<p>"They've got a plat," said engineer Harry Jewett during a civil deposition. "They can do anything under that, whether it would have been a mobile home park or a subdivision of single-family residences or a skating rink or a shopping mall or whatever."</em></blockquote>The result?<blockquote><em>In the end, [district court Judge Andy] Mireles granted Schaefer nearly every item on his wish list, including exemptions from the city's drainage rules. </p>

<p>The decision meant Schaefer could use his vague plan, and he was also exempted from ordinances covering safety standards for issues such as street construction.</em></blockquote>Until recently, San Antonio bureaucrats appear to have been complicit in this undermining of their own laws.  But that has been changing as more and more citizens become concerned with runaway growth:<blockquote><em>With the hiring of City Attorney Andrew Martin in 2002, San Antonio officials began challenging more grandfathering claims, although most still are approved. The development industry has turned to an old friend, the Texas Legislature, to seek a remedy.</p>

<p>In the past five years, members of the real estate industry who have publicly supported the vested rights law paid more than $4 million in campaign contributions to Texas lawmakers and spent at least $11.7 million in lobbying fees.</p>

<p>During that time, legislators filed several bills that broadened the type of plans that could trigger exemptions.</em></blockquote>So who are the real estate developers' friends in the state capitol that created, and seek to continue, this environment so hostile to local communities?</p>

<p>As those monetary figures above should indicate, there are plenty.  And at the top, the list includes the current Governor of Texas, Rick "Goodhair" Perry himself.  From the Express-News' October <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA101805.01A.VestedPolitics.de2a462.html">investigation</a>:<blockquote><em>When San Antonio's top developers threw a fundraiser last year [2004] for Texas Gov. Rick Perry, architect Steve Heflin [then President of the Greater San Antonio Builders Association] assured colleagues the poolside gala would pay off.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"All of you who participated and contributed — Gov. Perry thanks you for it," Heflin wrote. "Next year when we are campaigning for vested rights legislation, we know we have a friend at our state capitol."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Perry, who received nearly $400,000 in the past five years from the [Texas real estate] industry, has signed three vested rights bills.</p>

<p>The legislation broadened the type of permits that trigger exemptions and whittled down the authority of cities to impose development controls.</em></blockquote>To help get the government of this state out of the hands of special interests, Governor Perry has got to go.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A little at least.  It has been so dry here over the last year, but especially over the last couple months, that the entire countryside feels like a series of devastating fires waiting to happen.  A few hours north of here, they haven't been so lucky, and the devastation started a couple weeks ago.</p>

<p>Hopefully, tonight's brief shower will help postpone those pending fires in our part of Texas beyond the next rain, whenever that may be.  Or else we may get more stories like <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA011606.2B.newsroundup.916ba63.html">this</a> from the San Antonio Express-News today:<blockquote><em><b>Burning leaves ends with burning house</b></p>

<p>A woman learned the seriousness of the statewide burn ban when her house in the 1300 block of West Amber Place caught fire. </p>

<p>The woman was burning leaves in a barrel in her backyard Saturday when other leaves and dry vegetation on the ground also started to burn, District Fire Chief Larry Treviño said. </p>

<p>The back side of the house caught on fire. The blaze jumped to the attic, said Treviño, who estimated the damage at $12,000.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Normally, burning leaves in a barrel would be OK, but because the ground is so dry, it is too dangerous, Treviño said.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>The burn ban that this woman violated to her regret is being advertised on the TransGuide highway signs throughout the city.  The situation is so bad that this week, I noticed the "burn ban" had been elevated into an "arson/burn ban."  </p>

<p>So if you're in Texas, save your arson activities until we have a few good days of showers.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Now, our brief rain is history and the Express-News is reporting that we may not have much rain to look forward to for <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA011706.1A.lanina.da29eb5.html">months</a>.  Yikes.<blockquote><em>A bulletin posted last week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center stated that early stages of a weak La Niña episode are expected to remain in place for three to six months.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"It doesn't happen in a week," [National Weather Service meteorologist Walt] Zaleski said. "For now, it's imperative that Texans and people in the South restrict their water use and take precautions to prevent fires. Conservation will be of utmost importance to get us through the summer months."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"We won't get the spring rain, and that's where we're going to hurt really bad" if La Niña persists, [National Weather Service meteorologist Larry] Eblen said. "The drought's just going to get worse."</em></blockquote></p>

<p>In a written statement addressed to Helotes residents, Wal-Mart officials said they worked diligently to meet or exceed all the development and environmental requirements of the city, county and state, but ultimately decided to abandon their plans for the site. </p>

<p>“Though vocal opposition was present, many in the community expressed support for the project,” the statement read. “However, recent actions indicated that achieving a cooperative project was no longer possible. Although Wal-Mart is confident that these actions could have been remedied in court, Wal-Mart is unwilling to force the city of Helotes into expensive litigation relative to this site.”</blockquote></em></p>

<p>Of course, I don't see anything to rule out the possibility that they could just be moving a short distance down the road.  But I'll take good news where I can get it.  Congratulations to the <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.com/">Helotes Heritage Association</a> and their supporters.</p>

                                <p>Some unexpected, potentially big news on the <a href="../../../2005/11/helotes_walmart.html">Wal-Mart/Helotes</a> front.  From the San Antonio Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA120205.walmart.EN.34479229.html">today</a>:<br />
<em><blockquote>The world's largest retailer unofficially is pulling out of its plans to build a supercenter outside Helotes. </p>

<p>Wal-Mart officials won't confirm that they're tossing plans to build a store at Texas 16 and Scenic Loop Road, but property owner Balous Miller said the project is a no-go. </p>

<p>"Wal-Mart is going away," he said, adding that he hasn't received any written notice. </p>

<p>Councilman Jim Caruso said Wal-Mart real estate manager Matt Smith notified him of the move Thursday. </p>

<p>"Matt felt he wanted to at least contact me because I was a pro Wal-Mart advocate and wanted to see the store come into the city," Caruso said. "He felt he ought to give us a call and tell us that Wal-Mart for the time being opted not to develop on that particular site at Bandera and Scenic Loop Road there. </p>

<p>"He didn't get into a whole lot of details or specifics there, but just basically told me that they had a change of plans and he said he hoped to do something in the future." </p>

<p>Smith wouldn't verify the plans, but said the retailer "still has hopes to do a project in Helotes."</p>

<p>He declined to comment further. </p>

<p>Mayor Jon Allan said Smith denied the scrapped plans when Allan called him early Friday. </p>

<p>"But when I talk to Jim Caruso, I get a whole different story, so it sounds like Matt Smith didn't want to share the information with me," he said. </p>

<p>Wal-Mart spokeswoman Kim Randle wouldn't comment further. </p>

<p>Allan, who ran on a mayoral platform of opposing the retailer, said he's not celebrating yet. </p>

<p>"We've had rumors in the past that Wal-Mart was pulling out and going somewhere else, and it turned out not to be true, so I'd hesitate to pop the champagne cork until we hear something final," he said.</blockquote></em></p>

<p>Great news, if true.  But I completely agree with Jon Allan's words.  </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Friend and fellow San Antonian Eddie at <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2005/11/hardbergers_dow.html">The Red State</a> writes about a new plan to help make our downtown a more inviting place.  The plan, as described in Thanksgiving's <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA112405.1A.mainplaza.12c5e5ba.html">Express-News</a>, is this:<blockquote><em>Mayor Phil Hardberger wants to open up Main Plaza — San Antonio's historic center — largely by shutting down the four stretches of roadway that box it in. The redevelopment would create a green oasis on downtown's crowded west end.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>At an estimated cost of $10 million, the project would add trees, grass and a tiled fountain, replace the existing fountain and break up pavement and sidewalks for walkways of crushed granite or some other loose material. </p>

<p>Designed by landscape architect Larry Clark, it also would create a grassy slope from what's now Main Plaza — the roadway that becomes Soledad — to the San Antonio River channel, with the aim of luring river-barge passengers to the plaza. </p>

<p>"It'll be three times the size it is today," Hardberger said, "and it'll probably have 10 times the green space. ... We are going to plant a great many more trees, plants and shrubs." </p>

<p>Hardberger, who's to brief the City Council on the plan next Wednesday with Public Works Director Tom Wendorf, said the aim is to re-create an authentic town center.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Like Eddie, I believe this is a wonderful idea.  </p>

<p>Unlike Eddie, I don't live or work downtown.  But, thanks to the historic feel of the core of the city, the unique nature of the Riverwalk, and at least a couple excellent restaurants, I enjoy visiting on occasion.  Right now, downtown San Antonio has three centers of gravity that I am familiar with:  the Riverwalk, the Alamo, and Main Plaza.  Unfortunately, while all three are in close proximity to each other, for various reasons they are not well-connected.  In particular, the extremely popular Riverwalk exists as a subterranean wonderworld that feels completely isolated from the rest of downtown.  </p>

<p>So the aspect of this proposed makeover of Main Plaza that particularly entices me is the grassy slope that will smooth over the transition between Main Plaza and the Riverwalk.  Shutting down the busy roads around the Plaza and expanding the green space will also go a long way to making the square a more attractive spot for pedestrians&#151;especialy those of us just looking for a pleasant place to go for a stroll.  Done right, this would be an excellent addition to our city.</p>

<p>Having visited my hometown of Chicago recently, I have seen the amazing effect of well-designed, innovative, public spaces, such as the recently-opened <a href="http://www.millenniumpark.org/">Millenium Park</a>, on the vitality of a city's core.  </p>

<p>Ok, this is nothing to compare with Millenium Park, which is just as fabulous as it was fabulously expensive.  Still, it's a good idea.  The next step for downtown San Antonio.</p>

Two of the hard fought races were won by a mere seven votes (out of approximately 1300).</p>

<p>Since then, a month ago, the city council voted to place a 90-day moratorium on development while they study the issue further.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/neighbors/stories/MYSA101905.01H.controls.c4c9024.html">October 19</a> San Antonio Express-News:<br />
<blockquote><em>Applause and shouts of joy filled council chambers Thursday after the City Council, in a 3-2 vote, approved stopping development near Scenic Loop Road and Texas 16 for 90 days. </p>

<p>Council members Bill Wheeler Jr., Linda Boyer-Owens and Stuart Birnbaum voted in favor of placing interim development controls on the area that a handful of landowners asked to be annexed Sept. 12. </p>

<p>Councilmen Jim Caruso and Charles James voted against the measure, warning that passing it could expose the city to litigation. </p>

<p>The vote came after more than an hour of appeals by residents and attorneys to the council. </p>

<p>By placing development controls on the area, the council prevents Wal-Mart store officials and anyone else looking to develop near the intersection from filing "an application for a license, certificate, permit, approval or other form of authorization for development" pending a zoning study and annexation impact analysis of the area. </p>

<p>Mayor Jon Allan, who placed the item on the agenda, told the council he made the move because residents who asked for annexation want to have some control over development in the area. </p>

<p>"At this point, it's very cut and dry," he said. "If we put these residents' rights as wanting to be annexed in the forefront, I think this interim development control allows this to happen. </p>

<p>"As people pointed out, there's no rush." </p>

<p>Last month, a group of property owners next to the 32-acre proposed Wal-Mart site filed a petition to annex the entire area. All newly annexed property is automatically zoned residential. </p>

<p>If the annexation is approved, that could force Wal-Mart officials to go through the rezoning process, which would add another step for the retailer looking to build a superstore on property now owned by Balous Miller.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Now, the Wal-Mart faction is pulling their trump card out of the Texas real estate developers' bag of tricks:  "vested rights."  That is the idea that governments cannot control how land is developed once a real estate developer even thinks about developing a piece of land.  (Ok, it's not quite that extreme, but then again, it's not quite that far off the truth, either.  At least in the way the developers want the law to work.).</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/business/stories/MYSA111605.01H.nw16lawsuit.aa1a8ef.html">November 16</a> Express-News:<br />
<blockquote><em>Attorneys for landowner Balous Miller filed a lawsuit against the city of Helotes Nov. 10, alleging that Miller and Wal-Mart, who entered into a contract for Wal-Mart to purchase 31.6 acres from Miller in 2004, have vested rights that would allow the retailer to construct a supercenter at Scenic Loop and Texas 16. </p>

<p>"The land-use controls that were in effect at the time that Mr. Miller and Wal-Mart proposed this development are the land-use controls that we are subject to," said Barry A. McClenahan, attorney for Miller. "If the city — through this annexation which is, whatever else they say, is really for the sole purpose of stopping Wal-Mart, which the citizens realize — attempt to impose more restrictive land-use controls that would preclude this development, they can't do that." </p>

<p>Mayor Jon Allan said he couldn't comment specifically about the suit because city attorneys hadn't yet received it, but he said in general the issue of vested rights disturbs him. </p>

<p>"Developers are using vested rights to force developments onto communities," he said. "Our charge is to protect communities. This isn't about private landowners wanting to get a decent investment return on their property. This is more about greed than anything else."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"You have to consider the fact that the neighbors that live adjacent to this type of development, what about their rights?" Allan said. "These people have poured their lives, their sweat and their blood into their homes and then see it destroyed by these large developers that are going to create all kinds of traffic problems, light pollution, air pollution, noise pollution and significant degradation, not to mention water pollution because they have wells that almost certainly will be affected." </p>

<p>Miller purchased the 31.6 acres of land in 1982. Most of the land sits in the city's ETJ, with the exception of a small sliver within the Helotes city limits. </p>

<p>Because Miller and the retailer have applied for licenses and permits and entered into contracts for services, they have established vested rights, McClenahan said. </p>

<p>"I think that the law is pretty clear ... We have taken the steps to ensure that these rights are vested and that the law is there for a reason," McClenahan said. </p>

<p>But Allan said there's another reason. </p>

<p>"This whole vested rights thing is, they talk about the state laws, and let's face it: These vested rights laws have been fostered by developers and written by developers," Allan said. </p>

<p>"I think the voters should be outraged at the fact that communities are less and less able to determine how they would like their communities to be."<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Quite a new mayor they have there in Helotes!  We need more politicans like him, both in Texas and all over this country.<br />

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA101205.01B.eaa.12db270b.html">Progress</a> on protecting the quality of the water source for a million plus south Texans?<blockquote><em>The board of the Edwards Aquifer Authority voted Tuesday to move ahead next year with drafting rules to better protect water quality — including controversial measures that could limit the extent of development atop the recharge zone. </p>

<p>"You're looking at a happy face," Bexar County board member and hydrologist George Rice said after the vote on his motion to amend the board's strategic plan for next year to include development of the water quality rules. </p>

<p>"We haven't said anything yet about what the rules will contain, but we've said we're going to move forward with developing hazardous materials rules and impervious cover rules," said Rice, an environmentalist who has been pushing for the rules for several years. </p>

<p>Impervious cover refers to roofs, sidewalks, streets and driveways — any material that prevents water from filtering into the ground and being added to the aquifer. </p>

<p>"That's a big step, and it's a step we have to take before we can do anything else," he said of drafting the rules. "The staff will come up with a concept paper laying out their general thoughts on how we ought to proceed." </p>

<p>Rice would not predict how tough the proposed rules might be or how the board might vote. </p>

<p>A motion to draft rules regarding the storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials on the recharge zone passed without opposition, but another on impervious cover drew significant debate before it was approved 11-3. </p>

<p>"The impervious cover question somehow brings out the challenge to our water quality authority," said Carol Patterson, a Bexar County director who opposed drafting those rules. </p>

<p>She said she fears land use controls might anger some legislators.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>If George Rice, a local scientist concerned with the quality of our water supply, is happy, it must be at least a decent action, though on the surface it just looks like a meaningless measure deferring action until a later date.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It's an exciting time for nature-lovers in the San Antonio area.  Only a few more days until <a href="../../../2005/09/government_cany.html">Government Canyon State Natural Area</a> opens to the public at long last.  For those who would like to learn more about the place, the Express-News ran a detailed article on the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA100905.1A.govtcanyon.3936c65.html">new park</a> over the weekend that includes a slide show and a nice map.  Here is an excerpt:<em><blockquote>Water is the key to understanding Government Canyon State Natural Area, one of the largest natural holdings within the boundaries of any American city. It opens to the public next Saturday. </p>

<p>Water first attracted humans here 10,000 years ago. It later persuaded them to stay when the landscape was an untamed and harsh backwoods, miles from the civilization of San Antonio. </p>

<p>And the water that seeps through porous limestone that covers much of the 8,622-acre natural area to refill the Edwards Aquifer below prompted a 12-year, $16 million effort to preserve the land from development — even as neighborhoods pressed closer and closer to its barbed-wire boundaries.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Government Canyon sits just outside Loop 1604 near Culebra Road, 16 miles from downtown. Visitors will find 40 miles of dirt trails to explore, many of them physically challenging. They offer the perfect setting for hiking and mountain biking. High heels and baby strollers should stay at home. </p>

<p>Seventeen trails zigzag the canyon. All have been cut into the rough terrain by volunteers who have worked tirelessly to prepare the park for Saturday's opening. </p>

<p>Camping, and perhaps horseback riding, could be permitted next year. But the overnight accommodations won't be fancy. A fire pit, tent and composting toilet will be the only touches of civilization allowed. No RVs. No showers. No electricity. </p>

<p>All of this is by design, to limit the impact of humans on the swath of wild land that's 10 times bigger than New York City's Central Park and eight times bigger than Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. </p>

<p>Overall, Government Canyon ranks fifth in the country for park or natural land within city limits, according to a list compiled by Trust for Public Land. The largest is Franklin Mountains State Park in El Paso, which measures a whopping 24,000 acres. </p>

<p>But unlike Franklin Mountains, Central Park or Golden Gate Park, Government Canyon isn't a park. It's a state natural area. The differences are large. Simply defined: The well-being of the land is the top priority, easily trumping recreation. Any activity judged to harm the environment will be eliminated — period. </p>

<p>"This is all about how rainwater gets into the aquifer," said Koepke, a lanky Ohioan who also serves as the top law enforcement officer. "And we take our role as stewards of the environment very seriously."<br />
</blockquote></em></p>

<p>Hearing the place compared to urban parks like Central Park and Golden Gate Park is jarring, because Government Canyon is anything but urban.  But given the sprawl that is rapidly encroaching that area, its surroundings may certainly look rather urban a few decades from now.  Fortunately, the park itself never will.</p>

(210) 688-2208.</blockquote></em></p>

<p>I wrote about <a href="../../../2005/05/just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon</a> back in May, when its previous opening date (never officially promoted) in June was postponed.  It's a fabulous place to get back in touch with nature, especially for San Antonians who won't have to drive for hours to get there.  The B and B team has been going out there periodically since 2001 to volunteer helping build trails, so it won't be new to us, but finally everyone will be able to enjoy it.  And finally we will be able to enjoy it without having to put in a few hours of hard labor (albeit very worthwhile labor).</p>

<p>Many thanks are due to the many years (or decades in some cases) of work by numerous activists and public employees that have protected this beautiful natural area so near to the encroaching sprawl of San Antonio.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>As you may recall, there was a hotly-contested city council election in the small town of Helotes, just northwest of San Antonio, back in May.&nbsp; The main issue was the <a href="../../../2005/03/helotes_heritag.html">proposed development</a> of a Wal-Mart Supercenter at an environmentally- and scenically-sensitive location, at the corner of Highway 16 and Scenic Loop Road.&nbsp; In the end, three Wal-Mart-supporting incumbents were <a href="../../../2005/05/san_antonio_vot.html">ousted</a> by three Wal-Mart-opposing candidates.&nbsp; In two cases, the margin, after a recount, was a mere <a href="../../../2005/05/victory_of_walm.html">7 votes</a> (out of around 1300).</p>

<p>Now, the two incumbents who lost by that margin are <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/neighbors/stories/MYSA062905.1H.NW.lawsuit.13860a58.html">filing a lawsuit</a> over the results:</p><blockquote><p><em>Saying it's just something that has to be done, former Helotes Mayor Steve Hodges and former Councilman Pat Wootton are contesting the results of the May 7 election in court.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>A recount showed both lost their seats by seven votes, but in a petition submitted June 23 and naming Mayor Jon Allan and Councilman Stuart Birnbaum as contestees, Hodges and Wootton allege a number of people who voted weren't eligible because they didn't live in the city at the time or were convicted felons. They also contend others were turned away who should have been allowed to vote.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>...
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Birnbaum was out of town and didn't return phone calls, but Allan called the move a &quot;huge mistake.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;We had a difficult election and we have a lot of things on our plate, including Wal-Mart,&quot; Allan said. &quot;To contest the election is just going to reopen wounds. The thing we need to be able to do in this city is bring people together, and this is not the way to do it.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Among other things, the petition states there is evidence that election officials or others involved in the administration of the election &quot;prevented eligible voters from voting, failed to count legal votes and/or engaged in other fraud or illegal conduct or made mistakes.&quot; This affected the election outcome, the suit states.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>It calls for another election if the &quot;true&quot; outcome of the election can't be determined.
</em></p>

<p>
<em> &quot;I think we've come up with enough inconsistencies of the records of people who voted,&quot; Wootton said. &quot;I'm not saying there's any intentional fraud, but there's enough questionable voters out there that maybe shouldn't have voted. We want to make sure everything is on the up-and-up.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>This is becoming reminiscent of the <a href="../../../2004/11/mysacom_metro_s.html">Vo-Heflin</a> fight half a year ago over a Texas House seat from the Houston area.&nbsp; Talmadge Heflin, the entrenched Republican incumbent, lost to newcomer Democrat Hubert Vo, by 32 votes, and had a very hard time accepting that he lost.&nbsp; He made many allegations similar to those being forwarded by Hodges and Wooten in Helotes.&nbsp; He even had the advantage of being able to mount his election challenged in a state House controlled by his own party.&nbsp; Yet he still <a href="http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004897.html#004897">failed</a>.</p>

<p>So it would appear that the chances that the Wal-Mart supporters will overturn the election of Allan and Birnbaum in Helotes are slim to none.&nbsp; And note that the margin of seven votes is over half of a percent and so, while small, is not quite as razor-thin as it might first appear.</p>

<p>That is more than Al Gore won by in 2000, after all.</p>
