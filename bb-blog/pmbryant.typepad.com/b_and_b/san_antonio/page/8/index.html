                                <p>Like Mike Thomas at <a href="https://rhetoricrhythm.blogspot.com/2005/04/san-antonio-blogging-update.html" title="Rhetoric &amp; Rhythm">Rhetoric &amp; Rhythm</a>, on Sunday I noticed a sudden flood of hits (by my standards) from a website/blog called <a href="http://scoop.agonist.org/story/2005/4/3/152043/0093">The Agonist</a>.&nbsp; I'd heard it mentioned on other blogs, but never read it before.&nbsp; It turns out that its founder, Sean-Paul Kelley, is located here in San Antonio, and he had just discovered that he wasn't alone as a progressive blogger in this town.&nbsp; So I've added <a href="http://scoop.agonist.org/">The Agonist</a> to the list of San Antonio blogs on the right and will be sure to check it out regularly.

</p>

<p>I don't have concrete measurements, but I still think the biggest influx of traffic to this obscure blog came when I contributed my post commemorating the physicist <a href="../../../2005/03/hans_bethe_1906.html">Hans Bethe</a> to the science &quot;carnival&quot;, <a href="../../../2005/03/a_carnival_of_s.html">Tangled Bank</a>, a few weeks ago.&nbsp; That reminds me: the next <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/flood_the_bank/">Tangled Bank</a> is only a couple days away, so I'd better get busy if I want to submit something.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I've also added Ranten N. Raven's <a href="http://www.robinjuhl.homelinux.net/weblog/">View from the Nest</a> to the list of San Antonio bloggers (a conservative member), and I've updated the link for <a href="http://arellis49.livejournal.com/">Roscoe Ellis'</a> blog.</p>

<p>UPDATE (4/05):&nbsp; Thanks to Jimmy K.'s tip in comments, I've also added <a href="https://butthatsjustmyopinion.blogspot.com/">But that's just my opinion</a> to the San Antonio blogroll.<br />

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In response to recent 
<a href="../../../2005/03/texas_legislatu.html">news</a> 
of the pro-development, anti-local-water-quality-regulation bills proposed 
in the Texas legislature by Senator Armbrister (not to mention Senator Madla's
separate pro-development, anti-other-local-regulation bills), 
<a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com/2005/03/texas-and-water.html">Cincinnatus</a> 
asks for background information on the issue of development over the Edwards aquifer, 
the sole current water supply for most of San Antonio.&nbsp; 
I do have some knowledge of this, so I was inspired to do some more reading.&nbsp; Here goes my attempt to help out.

</p>

<p>First, a list of expert resources on the Web:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.edwardsaquifer.org/">Edwards Aquifer Authority</a>:&nbsp; created by the Texas leglislature in the mid-1990s as
a response to federal court decisions; charged with preserving and protecting the aquifer;
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/">Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance</a>: a recently-formed alliance of environmental groups
dedicated to protecting the aquifer;
</li>
<li>Gregg Eckhardt's <a href="http://www.edwardsaquifer.net/">Edwards Aquifer Homepage</a>:&nbsp; the ultimate resource for Edwards aquifer information of all sorts.
</li></ul>
<p>Now, my attempt at an overview.&nbsp; Examine a <a href="http://www.virdelldrilling.com/images/aquifers.gif">map</a> of Texas aquifers.
The Edwards recharge zone, where water on the surface flows underground to enter the aquifer,
is the thin blue area in south central Texas.&nbsp; On the map, it looks inconsequential
next to the Trinity (green) and Carrizo-Wilcox (red) aquifers.&nbsp; So why is the Edwards so
important?</p>

<p>The essential reason for the importance of the Edwards aquifer is simple:&nbsp; 
a large amount of high quality water is cheaply available to a large city and many smaller towns.&nbsp; 
While the other aquifers in central Texas recharge very slowly and so are very 
vulnerable to over-pumping, the Edwards aquifer recharges very quickly after 
substantial rains.&nbsp; Much more water can thus be taken from it without depleting it.
A <a href="http://www.edwardsaquifer.net/aquifer.html">local expert</a>, Gregg Eckhardt, 
calls the Edwards &quot;one of the most prolific artesian aquifers in the world.&quot;&nbsp; (Alas, the aquifer's high recharge is not quite enough to meet current water needs and obligations, much less future ones, especially given the unreliability of rains in this part of Texas.&nbsp; So there are a lot of contentious issues surrounding who can use how much water and when.&nbsp; Such issues are beyond the scope of this post, but Eckhardt's <a href="http://www.edwardsaquifer.net">website</a> is a great place to learn about them.) 
</p>

<p>This speedy recharge is due to the extreme porosity of the Edwards limestone, 
the rock that contains the Edwards aquifer.&nbsp; This rock is ridden with large holes
and tunnels through which water can flow relatively unimpeded.&nbsp; 
Substantial creeks that flow over the recharge zone (where the Edwards 
limestone is at the surface) frequently end up completely in the aquifer.
Eckhardt <a href="http://edwardsaquifer.net/intro.html">writes</a>:
</p><blockquote><p><em>It is not uncommon for the Cibolo to flow 30 feet wide 
and a foot deep and, in the space of a quarter mile, disappear completely 
into the Edwards formation.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This suggests why allowing unregulated
development along the recharge zone and in areas upstream of the recharge zone 
could be a serious problem:&nbsp; 
<a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/p_Pollution.cfm">pollutants</a> 
(&quot;from fertilizers and pesticides to toxic metals and sewage spills&quot;) 
have a very easy path from the surface straight into the heart of the aquifer.
Since the early 1990s, as San Antonio's sprawl has reached the recharge zone, this issue has exploded into prominence, pitting the interests
of the developers against those of the bulk of the 
community in San Antonio and other towns that rely on Edwards aquifer water.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.aquiferalliance.org/p_Pollution.cfm">Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance</a> 
provides some more detail on the dangers:
</p><blockquote><p><em>We are literally poisoning our drinking water when we allow development 
to take place that will undeniably increase loads of pollutants over the 
sensitive karst limestone aquifer.</em></p>

<p><em>Urban development creates numerous sources of water pollution.
First, the construction phase transforms farm, ranch, forest, 
and pasture land into large areas of disturbed soil. Central Texas' 
erratic weather patterns can dump 6-10 inches of rainfall in a short time span. 
Erosion and sedimentation controls at construction sites are often overwhelmed 
by heavy rains and the result is muddy run-off leaving the site and entering a 
creek and eventually the aquifer and springs.
</em></p>
<p><em>When construction is completed, the development transforms pervious land into impervious cover, which means any surface that water cannot pass through, such as roofs, parking lots, and roads. These surfaces prevent rainfall from being filtered through vegetation and absorbed by soil, 
thereby increasing the percentage of rainfall that becomes storm water. Rainfall that hits 
pavement washes oil, grease, and other urban contaminants off their surfaces and into creeks, 
streams and recharge features. Increased impervious cover also leads to increased flooding and 
erosion of stream banks, which results in higher levels of sediments entering the aquifer and 
emerging at the Springs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The current water quality of Edwards aquifer water in the San Antonio area is 
very good, but, according to Gregg Eckhardt, there are 
<a href="http://edwardsaquifer.net/geology.html#quality">signs</a> 
from other sections of the aquifer that this may not always be the case:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
The Edwards Aquifer Authority conducts an extensive testing program 
in which many wells are routinely analyzed for pesticides, herbicides, 
and almost every chemical that people use or produce.&nbsp; 
In 2000, the concentration of every pesticide, herbicide, and VOC 
[volatile organic compounds] tested for was 
below the detection limits of the test used.&nbsp; The same cannot be said for 
Barton Springs in Austin, which occur in Edwards limestones that are 
hydrogeologically separated from the much larger and more prolific San Antonio section.&nbsp; 
At Barton Springs, scientists with the United States Geological Survey have been 
sampling for pesticides since 2000 and have regularly detected a few pesticides 
at low concentrations during baseflow conditions, and a larger suite at 
much higher concentrations just after rain events.&nbsp; 
Many regard the water quality problems at Barton Springs as a warning to other 
regional users of what will happen if Edwards recharge quality is not adequately protected.</em> 
</p></blockquote><p>Eckhardt adds that allowing the aquifer to become polluted would be very expensive:</p><blockquote><p><em>Once water in the Aquifer becomes contaminated, it will be very difficult and perhaps 
impossible to clean.&nbsp; The only alternative might be to treat water by conventional 
means after it is pumped to the surface, an expensive proposition that most cities 
other than San Antonio have already had to invest in.&nbsp; 
In most cities, water is drawn from a river or reservoir, treated in a central location, 
and sent to customers over a wide area through very large distribution mains.&nbsp; 
In San Antonio, there are many Edwards wells all over the city where water is pumped out, 
stored in tanks, and distributed to the local area.&nbsp; 
There are no large conveyance systems and there would be no way to move 
large amounts of water from a central treatment facility if it became necessary.&nbsp; 
Instead, there would probably have to be a large number of smaller treatment facilities, 
which are more expensive to build and operate.&nbsp; If it became necessary, 
the cost for treating Edwards water would be a very big number indeed.&nbsp; 
Whatever that number is, that is the value of the treatment the Aquifer is 
currently providing for free.</em></p>
<p><em>In 1995, San Antonio enacted the first rules and guidelines for 
development over the recharge zone.&nbsp; But only 2% of the zone is within San Antonio's 
jurisdiction, so more widespread requirements for ecologically sound development are needed.</em>&nbsp; 
</p></blockquote><p>The Edwards Aquifer Authority, run by an elected board, and which encompasses 
all or parts of eight central Texas counties, has been slowly moving towards establishing such 
<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA092504.10B.EAA.b596ea8a.html">rules</a> 
over the last few years—in particular, placing a limit on the amount of impervious cover.&nbsp; 
It appears that one of Sen. Armbrister's 
<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/editorials/stories/MYSA032905.06B.waterlaws.182ae5b2e.html">recent bills</a> 
is a direct response to this rule-making process—an attempt to shut it down before it gets any further. 
I hope to have a chance to write more about that soon. </p>

                                <p>I am glad to hear that the San Antonio-to-Austin commuter rail idea has some life in it, as reported by the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA032505.2B.commuter_rail.16f58c97c.html">Express-News</a> today.&nbsp; It seems a no-brainer to me, and I've always been perplexed at the past (and no doubt present) vociferous opposition by some.&nbsp; I have no doubt that something of the sort will be built eventually, with the huge recent and projected population growth in the San Antonio-Austin corridor.&nbsp; (After all, even Dallas has commuter rail.)&nbsp; But it would be nice to get it done sooner rather than later.</p><blockquote><p><span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody"><p><em>

A decade ago, people might have thrown rocks at anybody suggesting there 
should be commuter rail running from San Antonio to Austin, local 
advocates of the idea say.</em></p>

<p><em>
But now, with a steady stream of cars and trucks on Interstate 35 that 
just keeps getting worse, people seem to be warming up to the 
possibility, said Tullos Wells, vice chairman of the Austin-San Antonio 
Intermunicipal Commuter Rail District.</em></p>
<p><em>
Wells marveled at the interest shown at nine public meetings held by the 
rail district this month to get input on the concept. More than 60 
people showed up at the last meeting, which was Thursday at Live Oak 
Civic Center.</em></p>
<p><em>
It's gone from not in my back yard to put it in my back yard,&quot; Wells 
said. &quot;That's what really surprised me — how much support there's been 
from Joe Average Citizen.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>
Some people are willing to fight to get a commuter rail station in their community.</em></p>
<p><em>
East Side activist Charles English said he's not happy that conceptual 
maps show the commuter route running west of downtown, with a potential 
station near the University of Texas at San Antonio Downtown Campus. 
He's believes it should go to the east, through Sunset Station where Amtrak's stop is.</em></p></span></span></p></blockquote><p><span class="vitstorybody">The current plan involves existing rail lines that currently are used by Union Pacific for freight trains, so, assuming those lines can be acquired, it is plausible that this could become a reality in the not-too-distant future.<br /><br />If you want to do some further reading about this, here is a recent <a href="http://herald-zeitung.com/story.lasso?wcd=12250">article</a> from the New Braunfels Herald-Zeitung, here is a recent <a href="http://www.cyburbia.org/forums/showthread.php?t=16507">discussion</a> (at a website that describes itself as an &quot;urban planning portal&quot;) about the current proposal, including the proposed map, and here is the website of the <a href="http://www.asarail.org/">Austin-San Antonio Inter-municipal Commuter Rail District</a> itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, here is a 2002 article from the <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2002-10-18/pols_atlarge.html">Austin Chronicle</a> that discusses some of the history of the Austin-San Antonio commuter rail proposals.&nbsp; That article pins much of the blame for delays on us in the San Antonio area, where traffic just isn't nearly as horrific as it is in Austin.<br /></span></p>

                                <p>As was <a href="../../../2005/03/crucial_moment_.html">expected</a>, the Helotes city council last night voted to prematurely lift the 90-day moratorium on the development of a Wal-Mart superstore near the heart of their small community.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA031605.1B.helotes_walmart.141148268.html">San Antonio Express-News</a> tells a version of the story:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>With opponents shouting outside the chamber doors, the City Council voted to lift a 90-day moratorium on a controversial Wal-Mart development during a fractious special session Tuesday night.

</em></p>

<p><em>The measure passed 4-1, paving the way for the city to negotiate with Wal-Mart on building a Supercenter at Scenic Loop and Bandera roads.
</em></p>

<p><em>...
</em></p>

<p><em>During the session, supporters and opponents in the chambers voiced opinions and accusations punctuated by calls for order from Hodges and shouts of &quot;No Wal-Mart&quot; from people packed outside the chambers. More than 100 stood outside, listening to the proceedings on a loudspeaker.
</em></p>

<p><em>Some of the 50-plus seats in the chambers were empty when the doors were closed before the meeting started. Bexar County Clerk and Helotes resident Gerry Rickhoff banged on one of the glass doors and yelled, &quot;This is wrong, people are waiting in the cold.&quot;
</em></p>

<p><em>Police officers asked him to back out of the chamber, but later, Rickhoff and others were allowed in to fill the remaining seats.
</em></p>

<p><em>Supporters were in the minority among speakers at past meetings, but were in the majority at Tuesday's meeting. They said Wal-Mart would increase Helotes' tax base and be a good partner in the community.
</em></p>

<p><em>Opponent Stuart Birnbaum, a member of the Helotes Heritage Association, a grass-roots organization dedicated to preventing urban sprawl, said the only true way to know how residents feel would be to put it to a vote.</em></p></blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.org/">Helotes Heritage Association</a> is livid:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>

Hodges shows true colors, lifts freeze</strong>
<br /><br /><strong>“WAL-MART FIGHT HAS ONLY BEGUN,” SAYS HELOTES HERITAGE</strong>

</em></p>

<p><em>The battle against Wal-Mart is not lost in Helotes. It has only begun in
earnest. Last night’s special City Council meeting made a sham of
democracy, leaving citizens literally out in the cold. Mayor Steve
Hodges and Councilman Charles James proved last night that Wal-Mart was
a “done deal” made in secret last summer, and that the “90-day”
moratorium was only a trick to defuse the opposition.</em></p>

<p><em>
“Only in Helotes is an Arkansas hog welcomed and the citizens scorned
as outsiders,” asserted John Eakin, a leader of the Helotes Heritage
Association, following last night’s confrontational meeting. “I wonder
if Hodges is running for mayor of Bentonville? Well, he'd better start
looking for a new position. We plan to ‘welcome’ Wal-Mart by
challenging every step of the approval process, staging protests and
rallies and bringing legal action against them.”</em></p>

<p><em>Fearing the mass swell of opposition among Helotes area residents,
Wal-Mart has stalled on closing on the Scenic Loop property, delayed
submitting a preliminary plat, and hired environmental consultants in
preparation for an environmental court challenge to their building
plans. 

</em></p>

<p><em>In the wake of last night’s meetings, Helotes Heritage Association has
already received a flood of emails at its website, phone calls,
donations and other offers of support from angry homeowners.
</em></p>

<p><em><strong>The battle has only begun!</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>The Express-News article is strangely vague:&nbsp; it doesn't explain why much of the crowd was initially kept out of the city council chambers despite their being empty seats.&nbsp; And it doesn't make it clear at what point of the meeting that the seats were allowed to be filled.&nbsp; It also states that Wal-Mart supporters were in the majority of the speakers at this meeting, unlike past meetings.&nbsp; But what was the makeup of the total crowd?&nbsp; That is not described explicitly, but it does appear to have been dominated by Wal-Mart opponents.&nbsp; Hopefully, we'll get a more complete account of what happened in the coming days.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The actions of the current Helotes city council, both last night and earlier, stink royally, based on what I've read.&nbsp; I wish their challengers in the May election the best of luck.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>This is a crucial moment in the fight of Helotes-area citizens against a proposed Wal-Mart Supercenter in the heart of their small town on the outskirts of San Antonio's surging sprawl.&nbsp; This is only a few miles down the road from us, and in an area we are very familiar with, so I <a href="../../../2004/11/walmart_scenic_.html">have</a> <a href="../../../2004/12/more_on_texas_p.html">been</a> <a href="../../../2004/12/helotes_heritag.html">watching</a> <a href="../../../2005/01/belated_update_.html">this</a> <a href="../../../2005/01/another_article.html">closely</a> over the last few months.&nbsp; </p>

<p>A few days ago, several Wal-Mart opponents <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA030905.1B.helotes_walmart.11c7dbe2c.html">announced</a> that they are running for city council in the May election.&nbsp; Now, suddenly, the current city council looks set to rush the project through.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/business/stories/MYSA031505.01B.Helotes_Wal-Mart.13b6edee8.html">San Antonio Express-News</a> today:</p><blockquote><p><em>Helotes residents who oppose a planned Wal-Mart are steeling themselves for a special meeting at which the City Council will consider canceling a 90-day hold on the project.

&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody"> <p>&quot;It really smells bad out here,&quot; said John Eakin, a member of the Helotes Heritage Association. &quot;They're rushing this thing through.&quot;</p>

 <p>At tonight's meeting, the council will vote on lifting the hold and entering into negotiations with the world's largest company.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody"><p>
The Heritage Association, formed in opposition to the construction of a 
Supercenter at Bandera and Scenic Loop roads, is posting a call to 
protest on its Web site, as well as using a time-honored small-town 
method.</p>
<p>
&quot;There's a pretty good grapevine in town, and the word gets around 
fast,&quot; Eakin said. &quot;I think it's going to be a little bit lighter than 
in the past because it's Spring Break.&quot;</p>
<p>
Hodges said he doesn't know which way the council will vote and that the 
special meeting wasn't rushed.</p>
<p>
&quot;We're getting the results of that (study) back,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it's 
time to look at those results, and make decisions on where we go from 
here.&quot;</p>
<p>
Jon Allan, a member of the association and a candidate for mayor, thinks 
the council was hoping to push the matter through after the May 
election, but that it was surprised by the three opposition candidates 
who filed two weeks ago.</p>
<p>
&quot;I met with Wal-Mart, and we've talked about alternative sites, and I 
found out last week that they actually tried to purchase a different 
site,&quot; Allan said. &quot;So my interpretation is the City Council's actually 
afraid they're going to go somewhere else and they don't want to lose 
the tax revenue.&quot;</p>
<p>
Wal-Mart officials did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>
Allan said he believes the city would be better off preserving its 
small-town atmosphere than collecting sales tax from the superstore.</p></span></span></p></span></span></em></p></blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.org/">Helotes Heritage Association</a> is asking, &quot;<span class="style30">Should backroom deals decide the fate of Helotes?&quot;:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>On March 10 at a City Council meeting, the Mayor of Helotes announced
that a special public meeting would be called to discuss/take action to
lift a recently imposed moratorium and negotiate with Wal-Mart for
development on the corner of Bandera and Scenic Loop Roads, an
environmentally sensitive area often called the gateway to the Hill
Country.&nbsp; This will be an important meeting that may well decide the future shape of our community. Every
one needs to be there.&nbsp; We must remind the Mayor and City Council that
we are serious in our opposition to big box development on Scenic Loop,
a historic and archaeologically rich roadway used for recreational
purposes by people throughout Bexar County.</em></p>

<p></p></blockquote><p><em><span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody"><p></p></span></span></em>On one of our local talk radio stations this morning (KTSA), I heard a short report on this matter that made it sound like this was a done deal.&nbsp; The report also stated that the traffic study indicated essentially no impact due to the Wal-Mart (which is extraordinarily hard to believe).&nbsp; As I recall, the reporter did not talk to Jon Allen, John Eakin, or anyone else from the Helotes Heritage Association.</p>

<p>The difficulty with this fight is that the citizens of Helotes and Bexar County have virtually no power in this matter.&nbsp; The land in question is immediately outside the Helotes city limits though apparently Helotes does control a small strip of that land.&nbsp; So Helotes' ability to regulate what happens on that land is doubtful.&nbsp; What about Bexar County?&nbsp; Apparently counties in Texas have no power to regulate ... period.&nbsp; Columnist Lynnell Burkett wrote about this in the Express-News on <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/columnists/stories/MYSA031305.2H.burkett.12616470f.html">Sunday</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>When citizens implored Bexar County commissioners to intervene, all the 
county could do was send Wal-Mart a letter asking them to choose another site.
<span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody">
<p>
&quot;After hearing their concerns, we agree that a massive commercial 
development on this site poses irreparable damage to their community's 
environment, historical fabric and quality of life,&quot; commissioners wrote 
to the company.</p>
<p>
Fat lot of good that will do. The county has absolutely nothing beyond 
its power of persuasion to affect the situation.</p>
<p>
And that illustrates the huge problem facing counties created in the 
19th century as they try to deal with 21st-century problems. </p>
<p>
It highlights the barrier that Texans face in controlling sprawl and 
saving not only the Hill Country but all scenic areas and a rural way of 
life in the state.</p>
<p>
When the state constitution created counties, they received no power to 
regulate — in other words, set standards for — development. That just 
wasn't a major problem in 1876.</p>
<p>
Although legislators have tried in recent sessions to grant some 
authority to counties, the bill has been killed each time.</p>
<p>
Because of urban sprawl, time is of the essence. As Comal County 
Commissioner Jay Millikin, an ardent supporter of regulatory authority 
for counties, told Express-News reporter Roger Croteau: &quot;At some point 
in time, in the not too distant future, it's going to be useless to 
Comal County. There won't be any farm- and ranch land left. It will all 
be subdivisions.&quot;</p></span></span></em></p></blockquote><p>Apparently some in our legislature are trying to remedy this situation.&nbsp; Burkett mentions Republicans Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio in the state Senate and Carter Casteel of New Braunfels in the state House.&nbsp; They deserve our support, as they will need all the help they can get.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Not much new, but last week (January 26) the San Antonio Express-News published another <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/neighbors/stories/MYSA012605.1H.nwwalmart.3dcf5b77.html" title="MySA.com: Neighbors">article</a> on the Wal-Mart in Helotes story:</p><blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><strong></strong></span><em>HELOTES — A week after City Council voted to stonewall plans for a Wal-Mart Supercenter on a pastoral slice of property straddling the city boundary and its extraterritorial jurisdiction, store officials say they'd still like to negotiate with the city and residents.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>On Jan. 12, City Council voted 3-2 to have city attorneys draft a moratorium on new commercial development at that intersection, hinging on a traffic study done by the city. It also authorized the city to file suit to prevent development that would be in violation of the public health, safety and welfare of the residents.</em><span class="vitstorybody"> <p><em>It was a move that was met with approval by Helotes and Grey Forest residents who have been pushing the council to fight the retailer.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;To the surprise of the group that was so adamantly opposed to Wal-Mart, the majority of the council supports not having Wal-Mart,&quot; said Helotes Mayor Steve Hodges. &quot;They're looking at it more as a quality-of-life issue than a money issue.&quot;</em></p> <p><em>Any such action could stop development on the site because a sliver of property along Scenic Loop Road rests within the city limits, said city attorney David Earl.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;Their development has presumed an access directly on Scenic Loop Road, and the city has a clear concern for truck traffic and additional traffic on Scenic Loop Road,&quot; Earl said. &quot;Despite raising those concerns, Wal-Mart has never changed the proposal. <br /></em></p> <p><em>&quot;I think the move is prudent and correct given the fact that (the council) has the desire and obligation to protect the integrity of the traffic system within its city limits. In addition, it has the power to enforce traffic regulations in its (extraterritorial jurisdiction.)&quot; <br /></em></p> <p><em>The city also could take legal action based on the Texas Local Government Code that says that the city has a right to prevent any development that would create a nuisance within 5,000 feet, he explained.
&nbsp; <br /></em></p> <p><em>But councilman Jim Caruso, who voted against taking action to thwart Wal-Mart, said the attempt is not a slam-dunk, and the cost of fighting it will rest on taxpayer shoulders. <br /></em></p> <p><em>&quot;My opinion is that by doing that, we weren't being as forthcoming to the citizens of Helotes as the council should have been,&quot; he said.&nbsp; &quot;There was no discussion to let the citizens know that it's a pretty weak effort on our part that could potentially work, but the lawyers weren't really warm and fuzzy about the idea.&quot;
&nbsp; <br /></em></p> <p><em>Caruso said the city turned its back on a good offer that could be an economic boon to the city. If store officials requested annexation to Helotes, city officials have estimated it could mean a gain of more than $1 million in revenues each year.</em></p> <p><em>Now, they will be lucky if Wal-Mart continues to extend an olive branch, Caruso said.</em></p> <p><em>&quot;If you're there to offer the community a supercenter that would boost tax revenues up and are willing to redesign a standard, ugly store into something that looks like old town Helotes and you're willing to meet requirements that the city has instilled on all its businesses ... and somebody bites off your hand, what do you think your reaction would be?&nbsp; I think they are going to stick their middle finger at us and tell us to go to hell,&quot; he said.</em></p></span></p></blockquote><p>Given Wal-Mart's new found love for public relations, I think Caruso is mistaken.&nbsp; But we'll see.</p>

<p>The decision came after Wal-Mart representatives attended Wednesday's special meeting, determined to hear what residents had to say.</p>

<p>The majority of the 300-plus people at the Helotes 4-H Center gave Wal-Mart plenty to listen to.

&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>Yesterday, The President &amp; CEO, as he is described on their website, Joe Gwathney, responded to my concerns.&nbsp; (I suspect I got their attention by not being shy about mentioning my previous support and my strong reservations about renewing, but given that I've never written them before, I can't say for sure.)&nbsp; Given that it was a private email, I won't post his response here, but I will say that I am at least somewhat reassured that they realize that they made a mistake in airing that essay as they did.&nbsp; I'm not sure when or if I will renew my membership, but I suspect it will happen soon enough as long as this kind of incident doesn't become repetetive.&nbsp; I'll definitely be paying attention, though.</p>

<p><span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody">Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.org/">here</a> is the website of the Helotes Heritage Association, the organization leading the drive to block this Wal-Mart.&nbsp; <br /><br />And</span></span> <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/business/stories/MYSA120204.kens.walmart.3fffae4.html">here</a> is a brief article about the latest in the Helotes Wal-Mart issue:&nbsp; an overflow public turnout at a Helotest City Council meeting last night.&nbsp; Not much new info except perhaps for this:&nbsp; &quot;<span class="vitstorybody"><span class="vitstorybody">The council stated they would schedule an executive session aimed at 
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;figuring out what it can legally do if it chooses to block Wal-Mart.&quot;&nbsp; Is the council starting to come around, or are they just trying to stall?<br /><br /><br /><br /></span></span></p>
