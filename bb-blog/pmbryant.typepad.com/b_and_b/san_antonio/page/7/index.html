                                <p>Express-News columnist Roddy Stinson is once again playing up the idea that the San Antonio city council strongly resembles that of <a href="../../../2005/06/berkeley_deep_i.html">Berkeley</a>.&nbsp; &quot;The similarities are eerie,&quot; he <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/rstinson/stories/MYSA062605.3A.stinson.9eaed7c.html">writes</a>, before launching into a step-by-step comparison of &quot;BERKELEY WEST&quot;—the famous one, in northern California—and &quot;BERKELEY SOUTHWEST&quot;—the new nickname for the Alamo city that Stinson coined a mere two weeks ago in a <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/columnists/stories/MYSA061205.3A.stinson.305344313.html">previous column</a>.</p>

<p>I find the case less than compelling, but I hope that, if Stinson decides to keep pursing this angle, he takes out a map of North America.&nbsp; My former home of Hololulu may arguably be labelled &quot;BERKELEY SOUTHWEST.&quot;&nbsp; But not the home of Phil Hardberger.</p>

<p>If he dislikes using the word &quot;southeast&quot;—and I can understand that many Texans would have a natural aversion to any word with &quot;east&quot; in it—perhaps he can label San Antonio instead as AUSTIN SOUTHWEST or BOSTON SOUTHWEST or even OTTAWA SOUTHWEST.&nbsp; After all, from Stinson's point of view, those Canadians no doubt have plenty of their own surplus-spending, noise-abating, artist-supporting tendencies.</p>

                                <p>Phil Hardberger is the new <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA060705.runoff.en.2f0b8a27a.html">mayor of San Antonio</a><a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA060705.runoff.en.2f0b8a27a.html">&nbsp;</a>, winning a relatively high-turnout, close runoff election against Julian Castro.&nbsp; Matt at <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/06/election-night.html">Just Another Blog</a>, Cincinnatus at <a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com/2005/06/its-done.html">The Jeffersonian</a>, and Eddie at <a href="http://theredstate.typepad.com/texas/2005/06/liveblogging_th.html">The Red State</a> all posted in detail about the election yesterday.</p>

<p>Driving home from our excursion last night at around 10:30 P.M., we turned on the radio briefly and were not particularly surprised to find that the race was still too close to call.&nbsp; 60% of the vote was in and Hardberger had a slight lead.&nbsp; A couple hours later I checked in again and found, via <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/06/election-night.html">Matt's blog</a>, that it was all over.&nbsp; Hardberger had won by 3%.</p>

<p>At that point, the other member of this household finally let it slip that she indeed had a strong preference in this race, despite earlier professions to the contrary.&nbsp; Upon hearing of Hardberger's victory from me, a quiet, but distinct and forceful &quot;Yes!&quot; could clearly be heard.&nbsp; Apparently the experience factor was decisive for her.</p>

<p>As for me, I had a very slight preference the other way, but am not disappointed in Hardberger's victory.&nbsp; I'm looking forward to what he will try to accomplish for our city over the next four years.</p>

                                <p>San Antonio mayoral candidate Phil Hardberger.&nbsp; <a href="../../../2005/05/just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon State Natural Area</a>.&nbsp; What do they have to do with each other?&nbsp; </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=14627672&amp;BRD=2318&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=484045&amp;rfi=6">San Antonio Current</a> spells out Hardberger's small role, back in the 1970s, at the beginning of the long and convoluted process that eventually led to the creation of the state natural area on much of the land that once was scheduled to be part of a huge subdivision of thousands of houses on the outskirts of San Antonio.</p><blockquote><p><em>As a mayoral candidate, Hardberger
recently took credit &quot;for stopping San Antonio Ranch,&quot; but upon further
reflection says he merely jump-started the process. Although he lost
the 1970s lawsuit against the HUD project, the case was the catalyst
for the high level of community interest in the Edwards Aquifer over
the past 30 years.&nbsp; </em></p>



<p><em>&quot;That was a truly huge lawsuit,&quot;
says Hardberger. &quot;This was a planned city of nearly 100,000 people
directly over the Recharge Zone, when very few people understood there
was a recharge zone. It galvanized public opinion to the danger of
polluting the aquifer.&quot;</em></p>

<p>...</p>

<p><em>The development would have proceeded as
planned but for City Planning Director Edward F. Davis, an ardent
environmentalist. He was distressed by a developer-drafted
environmental impact statement's &quot;summary dismissal of potential ill
effects of the SAR on the aquifer,&quot; according to Wattersons' book [The Politics of New Community: A Case Study of San Antonio Ranch].</em></p>

<p><em>After nasty political infighting at the
local, state, and national levels, the League of Women Voters, Citizens
for a Better Environment, a local chapter of the Sierra Club, and the
American Association of University Women sued HUD in federal court and
hired attorney Hardberger to try their case.</em></p></blockquote><p>Hardberger lost the case.&nbsp; But the movement to preserve the land was begun, eventually breaking through in the early 1990s.&nbsp; How much credit does Hardberger deserve?&nbsp; Some, certainly.&nbsp; But many others' contributions were far greater, especially since Hardberger does not appear to have been involved significantly after losing this case.&nbsp; Based on this account, the award for &quot;jump-starting&quot; the process should belong to Edward Davis and the individuals and organizations that initiated the lawsuit, not to their lawyer.</p>

<p>Anyway, I remain undecided about my preferred outcome for tomorrow's mayoral runoff election.&nbsp; If I had a vote, I suspect it would go to Julian Castro, since Hardberger's strong support from the bulk of the cities' entrenched special interests disturbs me.&nbsp; But it is not a strong preference.&nbsp; Hardberger, as shown by his at-times overblown claims about his role in the creation of Government Canyon Sate Natural Area, appears to have his heart in the right place.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>According to the <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.org/">Helotes Heritage Association</a> website, the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/neighbors/stories/MYSA051805.1H.NW.helotescliffhanger.27e8e6daf.html">recount</a> in the <a href="../../../2005/05/who_won_the_rac.html">Helotes elections</a> has confirmed the victory of the Wal-Mart opponents over the incumbent mayor and city council members.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>NEWS FLASH! Recount makes it official </em><br /><em>
HELOTES TAKEN BACK FROM DEVELOPERS</em></strong>

</p>

<p><em>Helotes
has a new Mayor and two new councilpeople. A recount of the vote,
demanded by pro-developer former Mayor Steve Hodges, has just finished
this afternoon showing that Jon Allan and Stuart Birnbaum won by a
larger margin of seven votes each. The vote is a clear message that
Helotes area homeowners want a change from the out-of-control
development policies that the Scenic Loop Wal-Mart scheme represents.
Allan, Birnbaum and Linda Boyer-Owens should be sworn in on Thursday,
May 26th. Stay tuned to the web site for more information.</em></p></blockquote><p>

As to what happens to the proposed Wal-Mart Supercenter at the corner of Bandera and Scenic Loop, just outside the city limits of Helotes, I have no clue.&nbsp; Hopefully the new mayor and councilmembers will be able to figure something out.&nbsp; From a few miles down the road, I wish them luck.</p>

<p>UPDATE (5:44 pm):&nbsp; Here's the brand new Express-News <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/neighbors/stories/MYSA051805.online.helotes.2894e97c3.html">article</a>.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>As you may recall, last <a href="../../../2005/05/san_antonio_vot.html">Saturday's election</a> for mayor of Helotes, between incumbent Wal-Mart supporter Steve Hodges and Wal-Mart opponent Jon Allan, was decided by one vote in favor of the challenger.&nbsp; Out of almost 1300 votes total.&nbsp; Pending a likely recount, of course.&nbsp; That didn't stop the Wal-Mart opponents at the Helotes Heritage Association from <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.org/">loudly declaring victory</a> with calls of &quot;It's time to move on&quot; prominently posted at their website.</p>

<p>To add to the suspense, it turns out that there is an approved <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA051105.online.helotes.2650a1a30.html">provisional ballot</a>.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><em><p>
The early voting ballot board will reconvene at 3 p.m. [Thursday] at City Hall to 
examine one provisional ballot that was approved by the Bexar County 
voter registrar's office. If it is in favor of incumbent Mayor Steve 
Hodges, it will tie the vote for mayor at 640. On Saturday, unofficial 
results showed challenger Jon Allan won the seat by one vote.
</p>
<p>
&quot;If it's tied, that is an automatic recount, and if that is tied, we 
will have a runoff election,&quot; said City Administrator Judy Tokar.
</p>
<p>
If the vote is in favor of Allan, Hodges can still can contest the 
results and ask for a recount. So too can Place 5 incumbent Pat Wootton, 
who on Saturday lost his seat by four votes to Stuart Birnbaum.
</p></em></p></blockquote><p>So who got that vote?&nbsp; We'll find out tomorrow afternoon.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; Stupid mistake.&nbsp; The 3 P.M. mentioned in the article refers to tomorrow, not today.&nbsp; I've edited the last line accordingly.</p>

<p>UPDATE (5-12, 5:09 P.M.):&nbsp; Allan got the vote and <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA051205.helotesmayor.en.26a5a8be9.html">doubled</a> his margin of victory.&nbsp; The recount is on.</p><blockquote><p><em>
HELOTES -- Jon Allan has won the mayor's seat by two votes and his 
opponent, incumbent Mayor Steve Hodges, has officially requested a recount.</em>
</p>
<p><em>
Election officials today opened the one provisional ballot that was 
approved by the Bexar County voter registrar's office following 
Saturday's balloting, and it gave support to the three candidates who 
claimed the current City Council isn't doing enough to fight retailer 
Wal-Mart from building a store at Scenic Loop and Bandera roads.
</em></p>
<p><em>
Pat Wootton, the incumbent for Place 5 who lost to Stuart Birnbaum by five votes, also has requested a recount.
</em></p>
<p><em>
City administrator Judy Tokar said the recount could happen next week.</em>
</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>It's nice to see pleasing <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/elections/results/#San Antonio">election results</a>.  On the surface, the San Antonio election yesterday went very much as I would have liked.  And I couldn't even vote, living a couple miles outside the city limits.</p>

<p>First and foremost, <a href="../../../2005/05/san_antonio_pro.html">Proposition 1</a> to renew a 1/8-cent sales tax to buy land to protect the aquifer <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA050805.18A.ELX_props1and2.251e0c3a7.html">passed</a> by more than 10%:  55.1% to 44.9%.  Proposition 2, to share the same 1/8-cent tax to buy land for linear parks, also passed, by a slightly smaller margin.  This is a sales tax I will be happy to continue paying, even though I could not vote on it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, my least favorite mayoral candidate, Carroll Schubert, was <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA050805.1A.ELX_mayor.251e891f7.html">eliminated</a>.  Julian Castro and Phil Hardberger will face off in a runoff on June 7, and perhaps I will finally be able to decide which of those guys I prefer.  Alas, I still won't be able to vote.  Castro got 42%, to 30% for Hardberger, to 26% for Schubert.</p>

<p>Over in the small town of Helotes, just northwest of San Antonio, where a <a href="../../../2005/03/helotes_heritag.html">dispute</a> over a prospective Wal-Mart supercenter at a scenic location has been simmering over the last few months, the Wal-Mart opponents ousted at least one pro-Wal-Mart member of the city council.  And perhaps all three that they were aiming for, though the margins in the latter two races are four votes and, for Helotes mayor, a single vote.  Yes, a single vote!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.helotes-heritage.org/">Helotes Heritage Association</a>, run by the Wal-Mart opponents, is already proclaiming victory on their website, though I suspect that may be premature.<br />
<blockquote><em>Despite the conflicts of interest, petitions, meetings, letters, phone calls, protests, sea of "STOP WAL-MART, SAVE HELOTES" signs and a car fleet of "SAVE SCENIC LOOP" bumper stickers, the Helotes City Administration ruled by pro-developer politicians Steve Hodges and Charles James tried to push ahead with Wal-Mart plans in defiance of citizens. </p>

<p>Voters yesterday rejected Steve Hodges and his allies, Jim Collier and Pat Wooten, to elect a slate of candidates who oppose the Wal-Mart and pro-developer policies. Initial talleys show Jon Allan was elected Mayor over Hodges by one vote, 640 to 639, in a record voter turnout. Linda Boyer-Ownes, who also opposes Wal-Mart, has been certified the victor over Jim Collier with 673 votes over Collier's 565. Stuart Birnbaum, another Wal-Mart protest leader, beat Pat Wooten 640 to 636.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Finally, San Antonio is a big city with over a million people.  So why did the lead candidate in the mayoral race get less than 48,000 votes?  Barely 100,000 people voted.  That strikes me as rather dismal turnout, by an absolute standard.  But of course, it's probably quite typical historically.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Here's the San Antonio Express-News report on the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA050805.19A.ELX_suburbsrdp.251cf5390.html">Helotes election results</a>.  Apparently Hodges is already breaking out charges of voter fraud and talking about questioning voters.</p>

		<a href="../../../2005/05/just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon:  "a place to recharge the spirit as well as the aquifer"</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Just west of the expanding sprawl of San Antonio, straddling the Balcones fault that separates the rolling, mesquite-covered brushlands of the South Texas plains from the rugged, oak- and cedar-covered hills of the Edwards Plateau, lies a ranch along an old road to frontier forts—a road cut by the pre-civil war U.S. military back in the 1850s.&nbsp; The road travels through a canyon and next to a reliable spring, where once upon a time dusty travellers could stop to rest and refresh themselves.&nbsp; The area became known as Government Canyon, after the road builders.</p>

<p>Over the years, Texas and San Antonio boomed, and developers of various sorts set their eyes on this scenic land that overlies the recharge zone for the Edwards aquifer, San Antonio's primary water source.&nbsp; Some had plans to build hundreds or thousands of houses and a golf course or two.&nbsp; Then came the savings and loan collapse of the 1980s, and the land was <a href="http://www.asu.edu/caed/proceedings97/lima.html">foreclosed</a> on by the federal government's Resolution Trust Corporation, which planned to sell it at auction.&nbsp; Fortunately, some local visionaries did not let this opportunity slip away, as recounted in this <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/vol18/issue37/cols.daytrips.html">1999 article</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Using the Austin-based Trust for Public Lands as a broker, the coalition persuaded the Edwards Underground Water District [now the Edwards Aquifer Authority], San Antonio Water System (city-owned water supplier), and other grantors to put up $3 million of $3.5 million for the 6,000 acres. None of the participating entities wanted to be responsible for holding the land, so they turned to TPWD [Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]. Offering the state the property for $500,000 sounds like it should have been a very nice little deal, [Danielle] Milam [one of the local activists] says, but the first year was marked by disagreements between the first park manager and the environmentalists.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Until Deidre [Hisler] was appointed we had lots of little skirmishes,&quot; Milam says. &quot;She has a way of taking the most hardcore bubba and making them respect the place.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>The first 4,717 acres of the 6,643-acre [now <a href="http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=18458&amp;folder_id=264">8,622-acre</a>] nature preserve were purchased [in 1993].</em></p></blockquote><p>And so <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/govcan/">Government Canyon State Natural Area</a> was born.&nbsp; Twelve years later, it is finally on the verge of opening to the public.&nbsp; Alas, not quite as soon as we had <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA043005.3B.government.2282f8116.html">hoped</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>After years of saying that the 8,622-acre natural area might open the following year, the state agency [TPWD] committed earlier this year to unlock the gates on June 4, but it recently backed away from that date due to delays in constructing Government Canyon's visitor center, exhibit hall 
and education center.
</em><em><span class="vitstorybody"><br />
<p>
&quot;We had set that with some reservation,&quot; said Steve Whiston, director of 
the agency's infrastructure division. &quot;We realized about a week or so 
ago that given all that remained yet to do, it was just going to be 
impossible for us to get it open for this target date.&quot;
</p>
<p>
No new opening date has been set. &quot;We want to make sure we're actually 
going to hit it before we do,&quot; said Brent Leisure, regional state parks 
director.
</p>
<p>
The people who oversee Government Canyon are hopeful that the public 
will be able to visit it within a few months.
</p>
<p>
&quot;We plan to do everything in our power to have an opening in the 
summer,&quot; said Deirdre Hisler, the natural area's manager.
</p>
<p>
Brent Leisure, regional state parks director, said that Government 
Canyon will almost certainly open in 2005.
</p>
<p>
When it does open, Government Canyon will offer 40 miles of trails, 
multiple picnic areas and a single large pavilion equipped with a huge 
fireplace.
</p>
<p>
It also will offer San Antonio residents and others an immense, rugged 
and beautiful place to escape.
</p>
<p>
&quot;It's going to be a wonderful site that people do not forget once they 
see it,&quot; Leisure said. &quot;It's a wonderful example of a really unique 
system that is so close to a major population center.&quot;
</p></span></em></p></blockquote><p>Fortunately, while the park has not been open for general use, it has been possible to get access once in a while.&nbsp; For instance, for over three years now, we've taken advantage of the opportunity to volunteer to help build and maintain hiking and horse trails at the park.&nbsp; </p>

<p>And I've learned that, even though it likely will soon be completely surrounded by residential developments, Government Canyon truly is a spectacular place.&nbsp; Thanks to the <a href="http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=5305&amp;folder_id=1545">vision and hard work</a> of many over the years, with <a href="http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=10121&amp;folder_id=264">help</a> from the money generated by San Antonio voters and taxpayers who passed Proposition 3 in 2000 (which will hopefully be renewed as <a href="../../../2005/05/san_antonio_pro.html">Proposition 1</a> this year), a large enough area has been protected to really give a strong feel of nature, even so close to suburban sprawl.&nbsp; </p>

<p>For those who live in California or other areas with an abundance of National Parks and National Forests, 8,000-plus acres may not sound like much.&nbsp; But it is huge by (non-Big Bend) Texas standards.&nbsp; This did not come easy, and people here obviously care very deeply about this <a href="http://www.tpl.org/tier3_cd.cfm?content_item_id=5305&amp;folder_id=1545">place</a>. </p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;Members of the community really feel that this place belongs to
them, and they are very committed to helping us manage it,&quot; says
Deirdre Hisler, the enthusiastic whirlwind who oversees Government
Canyon State Natural Area for Texas Parks and Wildlife, talking with a
visitor on the tree-shaded porch of the old ranch house that serves as
park headquarters. &quot;We are trying to make this a model for a new,
cutting-edge kind of state park--one in which our partners and the
people who live in Bexar County are involved every step of the way.&quot; </em></p>

<p><em>...<br /> </em></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><em>According to its master plan, the primary purpose of the state
natural area is to protect the canyon's natural resources. Human
activities will be limited to such low-impact pursuits as hiking,
picnicking, primitive camping, birding, and mountain biking. Eight
miles of equestrian trails are planned on the park's least sensitive
acreage. Although no construction will occur in the recharge area, an
eco-friendly visitor center, classroom, and a few other structures are
being built beyond that zone. </em></p>

<p><em>Meanwhile, scores of trained volunteers, along with laborers from
the Texas Department of Corrections, have been building a trail
network, removing non-native flora and fauna, restoring native
grasslands, and carrying out other tasks that must be completed before
the land will be opened to visitors. </em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>&quot;Our outreach emphasizes that there's more to do in parks than play
soccer or T-ball,&quot; says Hisler, noting that the ballfields some would
like to see at Government Canyon demand the use of chemicals that could
contaminate the aquifer. &quot;We're offering a more nature-oriented kind of
recreation,&quot; she says, citing Government Canyon's silence and solitude
as two of its greatest assets. Visiting high-stressed officials have
gone home relaxed and convinced that, as the park's manager puts it,
&quot;this is a place to recharge the spirit as well as the aquifer.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Many thanks to all those who made this park possible.&nbsp; We've waited patiently many years for it to open, so a few more weeks or months is no problem.&nbsp; It is here for the long haul, and that is what is important.</p>

		<a href="../../../2005/05/san_antonio_pro.html">San Antonio Proposition 1: Buying land to protect the Edwards aquifer</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Matt at <a href="https://justanothermatt.blogspot.com/2005/05/reasons-to-vote-prop-1_03.html">Just Another Blog</a> has a post up on the top ten reasons to vote for San Antonio's Proposition 1 in the imminent municipal elections.  Prop 1 is the initiative to implement (continue, really) a 1/8-cent sales tax and to devote the money to purchase land for protection of the <a href="../../../2005/04/edwards_aquifer.html">Edwards aquifer</a>.  A similar program was passed by San Antonio voters in 2000 and expires this year.</p>

<p>His first two reasons get right to the heart of the matter:<br />
<blockquote><em>1. The Edwards Aquifer is the primary source of drinking water for 1.7 million South-central Texans today, and will be for a million more citizens within 25 years.</p>

<p>2. If we fail to protect the aquifer and pollute our drinking water, we’ll have to build water-treatment plants that will cost billions of dollars. Talk about squandermania!</em></blockquote></p>

<p>A couple later reasons explain the rationale:<br />
<blockquote><em>7. New state law allows the city to acquire land both inside and outside of Bexar County, so we can now protect land to the west of the city, where 70 percent of the aquifer’s recharge takes place and where land is far more affordable. </p>

<p>8. Edwards Aquifer Authority studies show that when impervious cover exceeds 15 percent, water-quality problems emerge. Attaining that goal is more likely in rural lands to the west, where most of our water comes from.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>And land out west is cheaper, allowing us to spend the money more efficiently.  The 2000 initiative was initially supposed to acquire 10,000 acres, but only was able to acquire 6,500 due to dramatically rising land prices in Bexar County over the last few years.</p>

<p>San Antonio Express-News columnist Roddy Stinson has a similar <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/rstinson/stories/MYSA050105.3A.Stinson.22c4e44f7.html">list</a>, but from the opposite point of view:  "Top 10 reasons for opposing sales tax Propositions 1 and 2."  (Proposition 2 is another worthwhile initiative to increase the sales tax by 1/8-cent in order to acquire further  land for linear parks in the city.)  Stinson's list consists primarily of anti-local government rants and guilt-by-association-with-the-not-guilty.  </p>

<p>In particular:<blockquote><em>2. Taxpayers have not been told (a) what land, (b) whose properties or (c) how many acres will be bought with the $90 million authorized for collection by Proposition 1.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>So he claims it is a major problem that the San Antonio government hasn't already mapped out exactly which land they will purchase.  That sounds like a brilliant negotiating tactic, doesn't it?  And no doubt if they had, Stinson would be railing against government waste&#151planning to spend money they may never have.<br />
<blockquote><em>6. At some point, taxpayers have to say, "Enough." </p>

<p>If the state Legislature raises the sales tax from 6.25 percent to 7.25 percent and city voters approve Propositions 1 and 2, raising the local sales tax to 17/8 percent, San Antonians will be perpetually burdened by a sales tax of 91/8 percent!<br />
</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Note that first "if."  The state House, run by the GOP, is proposing to raise sales taxes by a full cent.  That is far larger than the increase for both Propositions 1 and 2 combined.  Where are Stinson's rants against the state legislature?  Also note the gratuitous, false, insertion of the word "perpetually."</p>

<p>As if that is not bad enough, he concludes with this:<br />
<blockquote><em>7. According to information on the Web site of the Aquifer Protection Initiative, Proposition 1's backers include the Alamo Chapter of the Sierra Club ... </p>

<p>8. Texas Environmental Democrats ... </p>

<p>9. Esperanza Peace and Justice Center ... </p>

<p>10. La Tuna Icehouse. </p>

<p>I rest my case.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Perhaps we can take advantage of Stinson's knee-jerk reactions whenever the Sierra Club is mentioned (I've noticed the phrase "Sierra Club wackos" commonly shows up in his writings.  It's kind of cute, in a weird way, given how marginal the Sierra Club is here in Texas.)  Next time, perhaps the Club should issue a press release directly to Stinson claiming to be on the opposite side of an issue than they really are.</p>

<p>Anyway, thanks to Matt for coming up with an excellent response to Stinson.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Via Cincinnatus at <a href="https://thejeffersonian.blogspot.com/2005/04/my-heads-about-to-explode.html" title="The Jeffersonian: Politicks, Sports, and Culture: My Head's About to Explode">The Jeffersonian</a>, I learned this morning that the front-running mayoral candidate here in 
San Antonio is in a bit of <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA042105.03B.Notebook.1f9921459.html">hot water</a> as a result of an &quot;appearance&quot; at a Fiesta event earlier this week:
</p><blockquote><p><em>
People watching the River Parade on Monday may have thought they were seeing mayoral candidate Julián Castro waving as the San Antonio City Council barge floated down the waterway.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>But if they did, they were wrong.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Julián Castro was hosting a neighborhood association meeting that night in District 7, which he still represents. His identical twin brother, Joaquin Castro, was on the boat.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The situation smacked of politicking, said Carroll Schubert, the District 9 city councilman who also is running for mayor.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;When people were yelling 'Julián, Julián,' (Joaquin) was waving madly, and when they announced all of us as council members, he was also waving,&quot; Schubert said.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;I think it's deceitful and showed very poor judgment.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Castro said members of the City Council frequently bring family members along on the barge ride, and Joaquin &quot;always&quot; goes along with his councilman brother. But, he added, the two brothers never pretend to be each other.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;Joaquin could never impersonate me. He's not good looking enough,&quot; Castro joked.</em></p></blockquote><p>Unlike Cincinnatus, I don't think this was underhanded, and I don't think it is a big deal, because I do not believe that Castro set out to deceive anyone.&nbsp; 

</p>

<p>Julian Castro is the clear frontrunner now, just a couple weeks out from the election, and would have to be politically stupid to pull such a stunt, especially right in front of Schubert, one of his two opponents.&nbsp; So I actually believe Castro's <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA042105.castroswitcheroo.kens.1fdfa56c1.html">explanation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<em> “My brother campaigned for me; he doesn’t campaign as me,” said the mayoral hopeful at the news conference.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>He says he planned on going to the parade but attended a neighborhood meeting instead. He says word of his absence failed to get to the announcer, who told the crowd Julián was on board.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Now, with his brother at his side, he finds some humor in looking alike and yet different. They pointed out that Julián has more hair, Joaquin wears his shirts a little baggier, and Julián is five pounds heavier.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>“We just hope that everybody understands that we are twins, God made us that way, and our mother is glad to have us that way. It is one of the blessings in life to have a twin, but we never impersonate each other.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Both of Castro's opponents have leaped on this incident, judging from quotes in the press.&nbsp; In the article above, Schubert calls Castro's alleged behavior &quot;deceitful&quot; and says it &quot;showed very poor judgement,&quot; while in a CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/04/21/twin.appearance.ap/index.html">article</a> Hardberger is paraphrased as calling it dishonest and deceptive.&nbsp; But such attacks are to be expected of trailing candidates, and are not evidence of anything, in my opinion.</p>

<p>As best I can tell, this was an honest misunderstanding.&nbsp; The brothers normally attend the event together.&nbsp; One couldn't make it.&nbsp; The announcer didn't get the information.&nbsp; If the non-candidate brother didn't happen to look very similar to the candidate brother, this would never have been a story.</p>

<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; For completeness, I should add that at this point I have no strong preference between Julian Castro and Phil Hardberger in the race for mayor.&nbsp; My only preference is that one of those two, and not Carroll Schubert, win.</p>

<p></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Great news for outdoors lovers in south Texas:&nbsp; San Antonio has a new <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA040905.1A.new_park.1bc2f1eac.html">nature park</a>.&nbsp; I know of a few parks in the works, but I had no idea that this particular one was coming.&nbsp; So clearly I haven't been paying close enough attention the last couple years.</p><blockquote><p><em><p>
The South Side is getting a new park today for hiking, biking and even 
camping along the banks of the pristine Medina River.
</p>
<p>
The Medina River Park will immediately become the South Side's largest 
park — and one of the city's biggest — and the only city-owned natural 
area in this part of San Antonio.
</p>
<p>
The park is projected to become the start of a 10-mile riverside trail 
that runs along an almost untouched waterway in the midst of a rapidly 
developing area.
</p>
<p>
The entrance to the 364-acre park is on the east side of Texas 16 just 
north of the river. It will open to the public today starting with an 11 
a.m. ceremony.
</p>
<p>
If all goes as planned, the park will lead past another large natural 
area, the new Toyota plant, a sanctuary for migratory birds and the 
proposed Texas A&amp;M University campus before ending at Mission Espada.</p></em></p></blockquote><p>I'm intrigued by this mention of &quot;another large natural area,&quot; but haven't yet found out what is being referred to there.&nbsp; The bird sanctuary mentioned is no doubt <a href="http://www.saws.org/environmental/mitchelllake/">Mitchell Lake</a>, which has recently been opened to the public on Saturdays.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The new Toyota truck plant that will be operational in a couple years
is apparently adjacent to the new Medina River Park, but the size of
park sounds large enough to help minimize the feeling of being next to
a huge industrial complex.&nbsp; I'll find out soon enough, I suppose.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>
Today, colorful wildflowers planted to help control erosion abound all the way down from the park entrance to the river, which itself is lined by large trees including cypress and cottonwoods.

<br /><br />&quot;We have nature parks in town in the north and northwest areas but there's no running water generally,&quot; Matthews [the city's parks and recreation director] said.&nbsp; &quot;This has always got water in it and it's just a totally different environment.&quot;

<br /><br />City Councilman Richard Perez described the park as a gorgeous and peaceful place. He said that although he's been promoting it to every neighborhood group that he meets with, few people seem to realize the South Side will finally have a place for residents and their children to appreciate nature.

<br /><br />&quot;No one knows about it,&quot; Perez said. &quot;I have a feeling that once people start going out there the parking lot is going to be packed.&quot; </em></p></blockquote>

<p>Oddly enough, the existence of this new park is directly connected to the water politics in San Antonio that I have <a href="../../../2005/04/edwards_aquifer.html">written</a> about recently.&nbsp; The land for this park was once planned to be flooded as part of the controversial Applewhite Reservoir project.&nbsp; This was a 1980s-era project that the city of San Antonio dreamed up to lessen its dependence on Edwards aquifer water.&nbsp; But <a href="http://www.accd.edu/pac/lrc/chicanaleaders/berriozabal.htm">many</a> believed that this was a poorly-conceived project that would encourage development over the Edwards aquifer recharge zone and thus pollute the city's primary water source.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Applewhite Reservoir project got far enough for the local water agency, SAWS, to purchase land, but then was narrowly rejected by voters in a 1991 referendum.&nbsp; The city tried to revive the project, but voters killed it again in 1994, and that was that.&nbsp; By the time I moved to town in 1998, it was referred to as the &quot;abandoned Applewhite Reservoir.&quot;</p>

<p>A decade later, part of that land has been transferred from SAWS to the city of San Antonio, and now makes up the <a href="http://www.sanantonio.gov/sapar/medinariveropen.asp?res=1024&amp;ver=true">Medina River Park</a>.</p>
