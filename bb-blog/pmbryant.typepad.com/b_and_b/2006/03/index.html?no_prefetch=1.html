                                <p>Spring must really be here.  We spotted our yard's first hummingbirds of the year yesterday and again  today.  (Likely they were either Ruby-throated or Black-chinned; we get both, and I didn't get a good enough look at these yet.  Perhaps tomorrow.)</p>

<p>A bit over a week ago, the <a href="http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/341/_/Nashville_Warbler.aspx">Nashville Warblers</a> arrived.  The first one was almost misidentified as our sole winter warbler, the drab colored and nearly featureless <a href="http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/153/_/Orange-crowned_Warbler.aspx">Orange-crowned</a>.  I remember a comment along the lines, "That's the most dramatic Orange-crowned Warbler I've ever seen!" when the first Nashville appeared.  The Nashvilles will eventually move on to more northerly locales to breed (not Nashville oddly enough), but for now we get to enjoy them.  </p>

<p>And we have reliable reports from just down the road, that <a href="http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/goldencheekedwarbler/">Golden-cheeked Warblers</a> have arrived and been singing for a couple weeks now.  Migration is on!</p>

<p>Or is it still winter?  The Chipping Sparrows, American Goldfinches, and Cedar Waxwings are still hanging about in significant numbers.  How much longer will they stick with us?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A feel-good headline from the <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_4581219,00.html">Rocky Mountain News</a>: &quot;Forest land sale sputters.&quot;</p>

<p>The first line isn't bad either.</p><blockquote><p><em>There's little support for a Bush administration plan to sell 300,000 acres of Forest Service land, federal officials said Wednesday as they extended the public comment period.</em></p></blockquote><p>The comment period would have expired today, but now we've got until April 30.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Meanwhile, two Democratic western Senators have a <a href="http://releases.usnewswire.com/GetRelease.asp?id=63276">solution</a> for Bush's de-funding of rural schools, which, as you may recall, has been the administration's <a href="../02/the_trumped_up_.html">pseudo-rationale</a> for proposing the land sale in the first place.</p><blockquote><p><em>U.S. Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) is introducing legislation today that will fund the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act without selling public lands. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) is cosponsoring the measure.<br /><br />The bill will raise $2.6 billion over the next ten years for the rural schools program, commonly known as the county payments law, by closing a tax loophole that allows some government contractors to avoid their tax obligations.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The legislation would provide a steady revenue stream for the county payments law by closing a tax loophole in Federal contracts. Under current law, the Federal government does not withhold taxes owed from government contractors that provide goods and services to the Federal government. As a result, some contractors don’t comply with Federal tax law.<br /><br />The Baucus proposal will help close the annual &quot;tax gap&quot; by withholding taxes from payments by the Federal government for goods and services delivered by public contractors at a rate of three percent of the payment amount.</em></p></blockquote><p>While Senators Baucus and Wyden show some leadership, the Bushies, in the person of senior Ag Department official <a href="../02/point_man_on_bu.html">Mark Rey</a>, show none. One of Rey's favorite lines is that there are no alternatives to funding rural schools other than selling off our national heritage, little by little. Just yesterday, he <a href="http://www.times-standard.com/local/ci_3654653">said</a>, ”We're open to alternatives, but nary another alternative has emerged.”</p>

<p></p>

<p>What will his tune be tomorrow?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><img class="image-full" alt="Pict0375375c" title="Pict0375375c" src="../../../photos/uncategorized/pict0375375c.jpg" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" />Thanks to the foresight of the voters of San Antonio back in the year 2000, we all have a new nature park as of this past weekend&#151;<a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/stories/MYSA022606.5H.romerocomment.1b873e7a.html">Crownridge Canyon Natural Area</a>, 207 acres of Hill Country on the far northwest side, amidst an enveloping sea of fast-growing subdivisions.  The <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA032306.03B.Around_Town.d0caa63.html">grand opening</a> was Saturday morning at 9.  Not being much of a morning person, I didn't make that, but we did drop by for a brief visit late that afternoon.  As you can see, I got a few pictures.</p>

<p>Compared to the 8,000-plus acres of <a href="../../2005/05/just_west_of_th.html">Government Canyon State Natural Area</a>, the 207 acres of Crownridge may seem like small potatoes.  But, like the similarly-sized, twenty-year-old Friedrich Wilderness Park just a couple miles away, Crownridge Canyon will inevitably become a special place in the minds of many San Antonians.  As the <a href="http://www.fofriedrichpark.org/">Friends of Friedrich Wilderness Park</a> website says, these modest-sized parks provide "an opportunity for visitors to experience the sights, sounds, and scents of nature in a landscape of creeks, springs, hilltops, and wooded canyons."</p>

<p>Nearly a year ago, the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/politics/stories/MYSA050205.03B.park_opens.23274dcd2.html">San Antonio Express-News</a> wrote about a sneak-preview tour of the park given by the city:<blockquote><em><img alt="Pict0372360" title="Pict0372360" src="../../../photos/uncategorized/pict0372360.jpg" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" />The Crownridge Canyon Natural Area is the first preserve resulting from about 6,500 acres funded by a sales tax increase that voters approved in 2000. The tax was meant to protect natural land near the aquifer, San Antonio's primary source of water, from the booming residential development in Northern Bexar County.<br<br>...<br><br>Staff provided short tours through the natural area, which is home to the endangered golden-cheeked warbler, white-tailed deer, wild turkeys, butterflies and feral hogs.<br><br>The area will provide nature-based recreation including hiking, day camping and wildlife watching.<br><br>When completed, there will be about two miles of trails, nearly half paved with pervious material for wheelchairs and strollers and the other half natural.<br><br>"It's for people who want to get away from it all. Listen to the birds, hear the wind blow through the trees," said Janis Merritt, a park native plant specialist.<br><br>"It's a different experience from our city parks with soccer fields and picnic areas."<br><br>Visitors to Crownridge Canyon said they were impressed by the effort to keep the area natural and apart from the high-priced neighborhoods around it.<br><br>"You can see what this area was like before the development. We're surrounded by houses, but some places in here you wouldn't know because it's so quiet," said Francine Romero, a supporter of Proposition 1. "San Antonio has so many beautiful areas, and we're losing them so fast. I don't want people to forget."</em></blockquote><img class="image-full" alt="Pict0343340c" title="Pict0343340c" src="../../../photos/uncategorized/pict0343340c.jpg" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></p>

<p>During our visit, we perused natural history exhibits housed in a large open-air shelter.  On the walls and floor of the shelter is a mural with a very watery theme&#151;designed, undoubtedly, to remind visitors of the reasons why this land was spared from development.  </p>

<p>News of the park's opening must not have spread very far yet, for, despite the perfect weather, we were one of only a handful of groups at the park.  So it was quiet and peaceful.  We proceeded up the wide, paved trail, catching glimpses of mansions dotting the hill tops surrounding the park and pausing to snap pictures and enjoy the late afternoon sun shining through the red oak leaves just budding out after a short, dry winter.</p>

<p><img class="image-full" alt="Pict0370300" title="Pict0370300" src="../../../photos/uncategorized/pict0370300.jpg" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" />We admired the solid trail engineering&#151;far more substantial than anything done by the volunteer trail building crew at Government Canyon State Natural Area of which we had been a part.  The city clearly put a premium on accessibility.  </p>

<p>As we reached the far point of the loop, a narrower, unpaved trail&#151;more typical of those at Government Canyon&#151;set off into the woods.  Leaving that short adventure for another day, we continued following the paved path back towards the park entrance.  Along the way, we watched a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk circle above us before landing in a red oak a couple hundred feet across a meadow.</p>

<p>As we exited the park, we were reminded that what is left of the peace and quiet in this part of the Hill Country is not going to last much longer, apart from a few oases such as Crownridge Canyon.  A sign in front of a large, undeveloped grassland advertised the opening of a private high school&#151;coming in summer 2006.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the voters of San Antonio showed further foresight a year ago in extending the aquifer-protection sales tax for another four years.  So, while subdivisions and car dealerships eat up our natural landscape more and more every year, more new city nature parks are in the works.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Those interested in solving the legislative neglect of Texas' state parks and who will be in the Houston area on Friday, April 7, take note. On that day, there will be a forum—hosted by the University of Houston-Downtown, the Sierra Club, and the Texas Coalition for Conservation—called 'Concerned Public to the Rescue of Texas State Parks.' It will address plans on where to obtain the necessary money to adequately fund our parks. </p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/3745075.html">Houston Chronicle</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;We're hoping to give people the information they need to be effective advocates for the state park system,&quot; said Evelyn Merz, who is helping coordinate [the forum] at the University of Houston-Downtown.<br /><br />...<br /><br />&quot;How park funding got into this tremendous crisis is much less important than how we solve the problem — how we find a long-term solution to the funding issue,&quot; Merz said.<br /><br />To do that, the public and politicians need to grasp the gravity of parks' problems and see some potential methods of resolving it, she said.<br /><br />To that end, forum speakers will including Walt Dabney, director of the state parks division of Texas Parks and Wildlife, and Joe Turner, director of the City of Houston's parks and recreation department, to help explain underfunding's impact on parks and the public.</em></p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, I won't be able to attend. But perhaps we can put something like this together in San Antonio, and other cities around Texas, soon.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>An excellent summary of the Texas state park system's <a href="texas_state_par.html">current troubles</a> was provided yesterday by Rick Casey, former columnist for the San Antonio Express-News and current columnist for the Houston Chronicle. (His move a few years back was a big loss for our local paper.) Some <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/casey/3739788.html">excerpts</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>It seemed like a great idea about 15 years ago.<br /><br />Texas state parks had always been a budgetary stepchild, so the Legislature decided to dedicate some of the money from the tax on sales of sporting goods to fund the parks.<br /><br />They didn't want to gold-plate the parks, you understand, so the fund would be capped at $32 million. That amount would also include some money for development of city and county parks.<br /><br />...<br /><br />But a few years ago, the legislators who couldn't properly fund schools or health insurance for children in low-income families not surprisingly also decided they couldn't properly fund parks.<br /><br />They cut the $32 million for parks, which had been set way back in 1993 and had not been adjusted for inflation, to about $20 million.<br /><br />At first the state Department of Parks and Wildlife responded the way organizations typically do when their budgets are pinched.<br /><br />...<br /><br />&quot;Last year we ran out of wiggle room,&quot; said Parks Director Walt Dabney. &quot;In November we eliminated 73 positions and cut back operations in about 50 parks.&quot;<br /><br />What we have is a parks system that is held together by rubber bands.<br /><br />The average age of the system's vehicles is 10 years, with an average of about one new vehicle purchase a year in the past four years.<br /><br />At Choke Canyon there is no potable water because the water system hasn't been repaired. Repairs from Hurricane Rita at the Sabine Pass Battleground State Historical Site and at Martin Dies Jr. State Park near Jasper aren't expected to be completed until summer 2008 at the earliest.<br /><br />Many facilities are open only Fridays through Sundays, and many have discontinued or curtailed overnight camping.</em></p></blockquote><p>The B and B team visited Choke Canyon State Park, two hours south of our base, a couple Mondays ago for one of our excellent birding adventures (which I hope to write up something about soon). Fortunately, we had plenty of our own water, as we were surprised to find out there was no water in the park. Now, thanks to Casey, we know the reason why.</p>



<p>I was not surprised to find out that Choke Canyon had eliminated overnight camping, as I had read about that when the cuts hit last fall. But I was surpised and disappointed to discover that we would be kicked out of the campground area near the shoreline of the lake, where we having a very productive and enjoyable birding afternoon, at 4:30 PM—with hours of daylight left.</p>

<p>Choke Canyon is a fine park that deserves better treatment than this. Our state can do better.</p>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://www.knoxnews.com/kns/local_news/article/0,1406,KNS_347_4557538,00.html">Alexander</a> said, &quot;I think the administration, with all respect, needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a better idea.&quot; He added, &quot;It kind of reminds me of selling off the 'back 40' to pay the rent. It's short-term thinking.&quot;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.wvec.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8GG9OJO1.html">Dole</a> wrote a letter to the leadership of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources saying &quot;I do not believe it is a wise investment to sell our public lands in return for short-term funding of a program that deserves full funding on its own — especially when the lands have been selected without the input of local communities and park rangers.&quot;</p>

<p>In this opinion, Alexander and Dole join numerous Democrats and a significant number of Republicans, including at least three other GOP Senators—Conrad Burns of Montana, Larry Craig of Idaho, and John Thune of South Dakota.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the congressional GOP leadership, in the person of Alexander's fellow Tennessee Senator, Bill Frist, stands with its collective finger in the wind—balancing their instinct to join the Bushies in privatizing public interests against vocal criticism from the voters who put them in office.</p>

<p>Advocates for the privatization agenda are thus forced to rely on their mercenaries—the think-tanks funded by numerous right-wing foundations. Think-tanks such as the Property and Environment Research Center, whose Holly Fretwell writes in the <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/federation/feature/?id=110008122">online</a> Wall Street Journal today:</p><blockquote><p><em>[T]he idea [for the sale of these public lands] is closer to holding a federal yard sale to clear out some of the junk that has accumulated over the years.</em></p></blockquote><p>Note that this 300,000 acres of &quot;junk&quot; is so junky that the feds think they can get $800 million dollars for it.</p>

<p>Let's hear more about what Fretwell has to say about this surprisingly valuable junk:</p><blockquote><p><em>At least one-quarter of the lands proposed for sale in the Gallatin National Forest near Bozeman, Mont., are inaccessible to the public. Other acreage is near metropolitan areas and has lost its Forest Service character: A small Forest Service parcel in Oregon is in the middle of a parking lot; another is being used to grow crops. Finally, some of these lands were previously designated for land exchange (trades with other agencies or private owners).</em></p></blockquote><p>Left unasked—if we can trust Fretwell's descriptions—is how in the world did someone get away with paving a parking lot over an entire parcel of public land?</p>

<p></p>

<p>According to Fretwell, land exchange—the traditional, widely supported, way for the Forest Service to get rid of isolated parcels while improving public access to other parcels—is just too troublesome to bother with.&nbsp; She gives only the barest of justifications for this novel opinion.</p>

<p>Fretwell throws out several deceptive comments in this piece, leading me to conclude that it is not a serious attempt to convince a wary public, but simply a pile of PR baloney—typical of Wall Street Journal op-eds and all-too common from administration supporters these days.</p>

<p>For instance, she misleads her readers by saying, &quot;To ensure there are no 'sneakers' in there, as [Deputy Undersecretary of Agriculture David Tenny] calls them, the public will have a chance to comment on all acres proposed for sale.&quot;</p>

<p>This is true in words, but false in spirit. The public comment period is a mere 30 days long, is already 22 days old, and the feds did not even release the maps of the parcels to be sold until several days into this brief comment period. How are interested citizens to be expected to gather sufficient information on 300,000 acres worth of land spread over the entire country? The original list was reportedly compiled hurriedly in the few weeks prior to the program's announcement last month, with little critical thought about the nature of the parcels in question. Many &quot;sneakers&quot; are likely to slip through these gaping holes.</p>

<p>Fretwell also furthers the deception, originally thrown out by Mark Rey, Undersecretary of Agriculture and Bush's point man on this public lands sale, that the lands to be sold are worthless to the public. Fretwell writes, &quot;Unlike Forest Service lands that contain important watersheds and wildlife habitat, these lands are a costly burden that all taxpayers are paying for. Let's stop the wastage.&quot;</p>

<p>With how quickly the list was thrown together and the ever-so-brief amount of time the public is being given to examine it, no one knows the true value of most of these lands. Declaring that they are a &quot;costly burden&quot; and &quot;wastage&quot; is a load of horse manure.</p>

<p>Listen to Missouri Governor Matt Blunt, who wrote to Mark Rey <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/D4DBAF526CC2840486257135006DDCC3?OpenDocument">last week</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px"><p><em>&quot;While the Forest Service has indicated that these lands were selected because they are isolated, in actuality many of the tracts appear to be accessible, utilized and valuable.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Also from Missouri,</p><blockquote><p><em>Jim Scheff of Missouri Forest Alliance said the Mark Twain [National Forest] list was compiled without thorough environmental analysis of the parcels and surveys of wildlife species and activities on the land. He said he &quot;has no doubt&quot; that there are parcels that provide important wildlife habitat.</em></p></blockquote><p>This entire land sale is a &quot;sneaker&quot;—an old, worn out one with no further use.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Is the <a href="../../2005/12/texas_state_par.html">dire situation</a> of the Texas state park system getting through to the members of the Texas legislature? An article in yesterday's <a href="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/outdoors/02/20parks.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> suggests that the answer is 'maybe—but don't count on it.'</p><blockquote><p><em>Texas state parks are funded primarily by a statewide sales tax on sporting goods, which generates about $105 million a year.<br /><br />The share for parks, however, has been capped by the Texas Legislature at $32 million, and even that number has been cut during a recent run of tight state budgets. The other $70 million is used for general state spending.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Rep. Edmund Kuempel, R-Seguin, former chairman of the House committee responsible for Parks and Wildlife oversight, said there is a chance the department could receive more money next year — but not from the sporting goods tax.<br /><br />&quot;That I would doubt very seriously,&quot; Kuempel said. &quot;Our first step will be to get (funding) back to where we were. Raising the cap is going to be a tough row to hoe.<br /><br />&quot;We should have been funding (state parks) at the cap level, but as money got tougher, (the Legislature) used the money to balance the budget. There was no anti-Parks and Wildlife sentiment,&quot; he said. &quot;We swept funds from a lot of agencies.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>If this statement was intended to make parks supporters feel better, I don't think it worked well.</p>



<p>Another Republican representative, Harvey Hildebran of Kerrville, is trying to get the cap on state parks' share of the sporting goods sales tax raised to $85 million. Explaining why he was unable to get that measure passed in the last session, he says:</p><blockquote><p><em>We had a lot of media and public support for it. Builders and developers were for it. The problem was, we didn't have the support in key positions in committee. The action wasn't as strong as the words.</em></p></blockquote><p>Builders and developers were for it! It is sadly typical of our GOP legislators (and a few Dems as well) to place such importance on the opinions of real estate developers.</p>



<p>I have to admit that I wasn't fully aware of the crisis in our state parks <a href="http://www.texascoa.org/news/ar_040205.php">at the time</a> Hildebran was trying to push his measure through. I was following several issues (out of many potentially disastrous bills) in the state legislature back in the spring of 2005, but this one never hit my radar screen. Next time around will be different, and it will be nice to be on the same side as the 'builders and developers' for once.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York announced on Friday that he is <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/17/AR2006031701735.html">retiring</a>, after more than two decades in Congress.  One of the few Republicans in D.C. with sensible priorities on science and environmental protection, he has been the chair of the House Science Committee for the last few years.  In that role, he has stood up to the Bush administration and the GOP leadership on a few issues where their priorities are badly misplaced.  In particular, he has been vocal in <a href="../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">favor</a> of NASA's embattled Earth-observing missions and <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2005-07-18-warming-congress_x.htm">against</a> harassment of scientists working on global warming issues.</p>

<p>Rather than replace Boehlert as head of the Science Committee with a GOP member who shares their hostility to much current scientific research on certain subjects, the House Republican leadership is reportedly considering the idea of simply abolishing the Science Committee.  <a href="http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/031606/boehlert.html">The Hill</a> reported last week (via <a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/archives/000880.html">Space Politics</a>):<blockquote><em>GOP insiders were not surprised by [Boehlert's] announcement given that he had heart bypass surgery after winning reelection in 2004 and that House GOP leaders are considering a plan to abolish the Science Committee, which Boehlert chairs, as part of a plan to reorganize the committee structure.</em></blockquote>If they follow through with this idea, it would certainly be symbolic of the attitude of Washington Republicans towards science.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>David Sibley, famous bird expert, author, and artist, and now the most famous ivory-billed skeptic, has a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/03/17/wpecker117.xml&sSheet=/news/2006/03/17/ixnewstop.html">story</a> describing how he came to his conclusion that the bird in the 2004 Luneau video is not the long-missing Ivory-billed Woodpecker, but rather a common Pileated Woodpecker.  In it he writes about his reaction to the initial announcement of the ivory-billed's rediscovery last year,<blockquote><em>I studied the paper and watched the video as soon as it was posted. Mostly I studied maps, dates, and locations of sightings. I accepted the reported proof without question.</em></blockquote>He then describes his trip to the woods of Arkansas himself, where he saw many Pileated Woodpeckers but no Ivory-billeds.  When he returned home, he watched the Luneau video again.  His new reaction:<blockquote><em>Instead of seeing an ivory-bill, there was a bird that looked like a pileated - small, grainy, and blurry, but just like all the pileated woodpeckers I had seen in Arkansas. I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach. I looked again and again, trying to refute my own conclusion, and I wept as the realisation set in - that this was not an ivory-billed woodpecker, and that this was a mistake that could have profound repercussions in the birding and conservation communities.</em></blockquote>I don't know if he is correct or not, but this story may help to explain why his analysis of the video, published yesterday in Science magazine, is not nearly as <a href="ivorybilled_que.html">thorough</a> as the original one by the Cornell team led by John Fitzpatrick.  </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>There is a new paper out in Science magazine that purports to cast doubt on the last year's celebrated rediscovery of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker in the forests of Arkansas. The first author is David Sibley, renowned birding author and artist. Sibley's target—the brief, blurry video, shot by David Luneau in 2004, that is the only photographic evidence yet presented for the woodpecker's modern existence. Sibley and his co-authors argue that the bird seen in that video is, in fact, a common Pileated Woodpecker.</p>

<p>In response to this new paper, some of my favorite bird bloggers are giving up on the Ivory-billed. GrrlScientist at Living the Scientific Life wrote a post titled, &quot;<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/grrlscientist/2006/03/goodbye_beautiful_dream.php">Goodbye Beautiful Dream</a>&quot;, saying, &quot;This bird's existence becomes less credible, more tenuous, with every passing day.&quot; Nuthatch at <a href="http://www.bootstrap-analysis.com/2006/03/sibleys_science.html">Boostrap Analysis</a> wrote, &quot;In the world of science, a situation of this nature would generally be considered to be at the 'back to the drawing board' stage. And I think that's where the IBWO is at. Still awaiting rediscovery.&quot;</p>

<p>After reading the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/311/5767/1555a.pdf">Sibley</a> paper, and the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/311/5767/1555b.pdf">response</a> to it written by the team that announced the original re-discovery last year, I am not so ready to give up. In fact, reading once again the evidence that the Cornell team led by John Fitzpatrick has put together, as well as their comprehensive analysis of the grainy video, I am impressed anew at the strength of their case. In comparison, the analysis by Sibley and his collaborators appears incomplete—their conclusions, therefore, unconvincing.</p>

<p>I have only yet briefly perused the evidence on both sides at this point, so my opinions may evolve. But right now, I am troubled by the tendency of Sibley and his collaborators to casually dismiss evidence contradicting the pileated hypothesis and supporting the ivory-billed hypothesis. </p>

<p>To take one example, Fitzpatrick's team has suggestive evidence that the fast wingbeats and direct flight-pattern of the bird in the video is far more consistent with the ivory-billed hypothesis than the pileated. Sibley dismisses this in one sentence at the end of his paper: &quot;We agree that 'we lack sufficiently comparable data for objective comparison' of these features.&quot; He and his co-authors spend a little more space on this subject in the supplemental materials, stating that &quot;identification based on the wingbeat rate of the bird in the Arkansas video requires clear evidence both that it can be matched by an ivory-billed woodpecker and that it cannot be matched by a pileated woodpecker.&quot; </p>

<p>The wingbeat rate of ivory-billeds is unknown, but the Cornell team has presented suggestive historical evidence that it is similar to the wingbeat rate of the bird in the video. The wingbeat rate of pileateds should be simple to measure, since they are so common. But Sibley's group has apparently made no effort to study this. The Cornell group, on the other hand, has looked into this issue and reports on their <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/ivory/rediscovery/support/frequency/document_view">web site</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>The wingbeat frequencies of Pileated Woodpeckers in our videos from Arkansas are 2-4 beats per second in level flight (many examples) and 4-7.5 beats for short periods during hasty departures (n = 5). Moreover, experts who have studied Pileated Woodpecker flight using video analysis timed the fastest departures at 7 beats per sec (Tobalske 1996, personal communication). Thus, wingbeat frequency of the woodpecker in the Luneau video [8.6 per second] is faster than any recorded Pileated Woodpecker.</em></p></blockquote><p>Sibley's case would be more persuasive if he took this evidence contradicting his hypothesis more seriously. On this point, this is not a mere argument over the precise placement and color of a few pixels in a fuzzy image. </p><p>As another example, Sibley and his co-authors gloss over the substantial amount of non-video evidence that the Cornell team published a year ago.</p><blockquote><p><em>The recent sight records (1, 4) were all very brief and most involved a single observer, matching the pattern of reported observations over the past few decades (5–8). Although such observations provide strong impetus for continued searching and habitat protection, they cannot be taken to confirm the species' presence because they do not provide independently verifiable evidence.</em></p></blockquote><p>The Cornell team, naturally, does not take lightly this casual dismissal of the bulk of the evidence bolstering their case. They write, in a footnote in their response to Sibley's paper:</p><blockquote><p><em>Sibley et al. (2) incorrectly claim that the sight records we reported (1, 10) ‘‘were all very brief and most involved a single observer, matching the pattern of reported observations over the past few decades.’’ In no case since the 1940s was a report of an ivory-billed woodpecker (such as the original one by Gene Sparling) promptly followed by multiple repeat sightings in the same area—sightings that included a close encounter shared by two individuals, each having extensive experience with pileated woodpeckers in southern forests. After studying the evidence at length, the Bird Records Committee of the Arkansas Audubon Society voted unanimously to accept the documentation of ivorybilled woodpecker (www.arbirds.org/ivory_billed_woodpecker.html). Comparable validation by critical and experienced local experts has not occurred following any previous report of this species.</em></p></blockquote><p>No one would give a hoot about this video if there hadn't been so many other sightings by so many experienced individuals in the same area in a short span of time. By not acknowledging the significance of these sightings, Sibley shortchanges his own argument.</p><p>This whole controversy should be moot relatively soon. With the exhaustive nature of the search that has been going on in the Arkansas woods this winter, if the Ivory-billed Woodpecker inhabits those forests, there should be plenty more circumstantial evidence soon forthcoming. If no such evidence is presented over the next few months, then strong skepticism of the continued existence of the ivory-billed will be more than justified.</p>
