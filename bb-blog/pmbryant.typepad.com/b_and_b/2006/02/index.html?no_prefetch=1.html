		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>My second excursion of the Great Backyard Bird Count <a href="great_backyard_.html">weekend</a> was a second outing into a cold, dreary landscape. My bird watching partner decided against joining me outside and many of the local birds appeared to be following her lead. At midday, the temperature was hovering near forty degrees Fahrenheit, as the Texas winter held us in its last grasp.</p>

<p>I started by sitting on our deck and staring at our feeders—one filled with sunflower seed and two filled with thistle. In contrast to the typical feverish avian activity in our backyard, all I saw was a solitary Black-crested Titmouse—his usual companions absent. After fifteen minutes watching this fellow eat all by himself, I decided to venture out into the neighborhood. If the birds would not come to me, I would have to go to them. As a further benefit, going for a walk would help keep my feet from going numb.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the walk revealed a few more birds—but only a few. A Western Scrub-Jay was hanging out on the side of the road in front of our house. A lone male Northern Cardinal perched not far away. Far off the distance, a vulture of indeterminate species soared.</p>

<p>Most of the local birds were clearly not going to show themselves to me this day. Where were the Carolina Chickadees? The House Finches? The White-winged doves? The Northern Mockingbirds? The Golden-fronted Woodpeckers? Trying to shelter themselves from the unusual cold, no doubt.</p>

<p>Shortly after I turned into the overgrown alley that headed back to our yard, a mystery bird materialized, hunkered down with its feathers puffed up at the top of a leafless oak tree. Was it a robin? I hadn't seen many of those this winter. Repositioning myself to see it from the front, I could tell it had no red breast and so wasn't a robin. After a few minutes puzzling over its identity, it flew and revealed itself as another Scrub-Jay. Perhaps the same one I had seen earlier.</p>

<p>A minute later, a small bird in showed up in a cedar immediately to the side of the alley, just a few feet away. It moved around constantly and was hard to identify, but I persisted and eventually pinned it down as an Orange-crowned Warbler.</p>

<p>A few more dozen feet down the alley, nothing else had appeared. My circuit was nearing completion. Oh well, I thought. It's brutally cold for this area and the birds aren't active. I have an honest, if modest count, of a single individual of several different species.</p>

<p>I was back to our property line, just a couple hundred feet from the house. The alley was now surrounded by dense growths of cedar trees. As I resumed walking after another fruitless scan of my surroundings, I heard a loud rustle to my left. Stopping abruptly, I peered into the tangle. I ducked down to get a better view under the branches. That's when I saw it.</p>

<p>A hawk! On the ground, barely five feet away from me. It hopped a few more feet into the brush as I watched, but then stopped again. I shifted slightly to get an unobstructed view. The hawk had a dead, gray, fuzzy rodent of some sort in its talons. It had dragged this prey behind him as he hopped in its initial attempt to retreat from me.</p>

<p>The hawk had ragged vertical streaks on its upper chest, black and brownish crosswise stripes on its tail, and a prominent yellow patch at the base of its beak. Its back and wings were mottled and dark reddish brown. As I watched the hawk, it held its wings out and spread its tail to form an umbrella over its prey—a not-so-successful attempt to keep the carcass out of my view. Perhaps the hawk thought me a threat to its hard-won meal. It took a few more hops into the woods, dragging its meal along with it. I shifted again to keep my view, but soon decided to leave it alone to eat, and returned the short distance home in excitement.</p>

<p>After exploring field guides and online photographs, I am fairly confident that this hawk was a juvenile Red-shouldered Hawk. When we've seen hawks in our yard in the past—always either flying over or perched high in a barren tree—they've been adult Red-shouldered Hawks. Seeing a juvenile was a first for our home bird watching; seeing a bird of prey in the midst of a meal was also a first. If it hadn't decided to try to drag its prey further into the woods as I walked past, I likely would not have seen it at all. Perhaps adult hawks are more careful about making noise when we walk past one of their meals?</p>

<p>The next day, the weather had warmed up a bit, and I took my partner out to inspect the scene of the crime. She was hoping to spot some bones or other evidence of the kill, hoping that the victim had not been the rabbit she calls &quot;Hippity&quot; that commonly browses outside our windows.</p>

<p>The scene was not hard to relocate. Amidst the monotony of overgrown cedar, just a few feet off the road, was a neat circle of gray fur. From a distance, it resembled a pelt. Indeed, this must have been a rabbit, she said. After poking around the undergrowth, we could find nothing else remaining.</p>

<p>As it turned out, &quot;Hippity&quot; showed up that evening at twilight, as usual. He had survived to eat another day. A relative of his had not been so fortunate.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Add the Bureau of Land Management to the list of federal agencies in which the Bush administration is making it difficult for scientists to do their work.  Based on the description in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/21/AR2006022101793.html">Washington Post</a> on Wednesday, the problems at BLM may be even worse than those at NASA, NOAA, and EPA.<blockquote><em>The Bureau of Land Management, caretaker of more land and wildlife than any federal agency, routinely restricts the ability of its own biologists to monitor wildlife damage caused by surging energy drilling on federal land, according to BLM officials and bureau documents.<br><br>The officials and documents say that by keeping many wildlife biologists out of the field doing paperwork on new drilling permits and that by diverting agency money intended for wildlife conservation to energy programs, the BLM has compromised its ability to deal with the environmental consequences of the drilling boom it is encouraging on public lands.</em></blockquote>Here are the words of a former Wyoming BLM biologist, Steve Belinda, who is able to speak out because he quit his job recently rather than spend nearly all his time on drilling requests:<blockquote><em>The BLM is pushing the biologists to be what I call 'biostitutes,' rather than allow them to be experts in the wildlife they are supposed to be managing.  They are telling us that if it is not energy-related, you are not working on it.<br><br>It is a huge attraction for biologists to work in western Wyoming.  But in this [BLM] office, they want you to look at things in a single-minded way. I have spent less than 1 percent of my time in the field. If we continue down this trend of keeping biologists in the office and preventing them from doing substantive work, there is a train wreck coming for wildlife.</em></blockquote>Apparently the BLM is devoting so much of its resources to handing out drilling permits, that the oil and gas companies can't even keep up.  According to the Post, they've issued over 13,000 permits in the last two years for drilling on federal land, while industry has drilled less than 6,000 wells.</p>

<p>This BLM story fits perfectly into the broader picture of the Bush administration humiliating and demoralizing the scientists employed to study the various aspects of the planet we live on.  </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Texas <a href="texans_for_stat.html">state parks</a> are in a budget crisis, years in the making, that has become particularly acute in recent months&#151;necessitating substantial reductions in park hours as well as staff layoffs.</p>

<p>But one problem we don't currently have is the imminent threat of a new superhighway running the length of one of our most popular state parks.  Unfortunately, in southern California, such a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tollway24feb24,1,2284619.story?coll=la-headlines-california">threat</a> is very real.<blockquote><em>Over the objections of environmentalists and state officials, directors of Orange County's toll road agency on Thursday approved construction of a six-lane highway through San Onofre State Beach — a popular coastal park that President Nixon helped set aside in 1970 as a haven from urbanization.</p>

<p>The 16-mile project, which has drawn a lukewarm response from the Schwarzenegger administration, also would pass through the Donna O'Neill Land Conservancy, a 1,200-acre open-space preserve created by Rancho Mission Viejo, one of the largest landholders in southern Orange County.</p>

<p>If the highway is built, it will be by far the largest project of its kind put through a state park.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>With 2.7 million visitors a year, San Onofre is the fifth most popular destination in the state's 278-park system. It contains endangered species, archeological sites, campgrounds, panoramic views of the sea and world-renowned surf spots.</p>

<p>When the San Diego County park was created in 1970, [President] Nixon noted the beauty of the landscape and said he did not want the pressures of population growth "to clutter up" the park.</p>

<p>"We must leave a legacy that goes beyond good housing, vital industries and strong defense," he said.</p>

<p>The proposed highway would split the northern part of San Onofre lengthwise before crossing over a marine estuary set aside as a nature preserve.</em></blockquote>Ronald Reagan, then Governor of California, was with President Nixon at the park dedication in 1971.  He <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2006/01/29/news/coastal/23_36_071_28_06.txt">declared</a>, "I firmly believe one of the greatest legacies we can leave to future generations is the heritage of our land, but unless we can preserve and protect the unspoiled areas which God has given us, we will have nothing to leave them."</p>

<p>The people who currently enjoy camping at San Onofre are not thinking "unspoiled" will long describe this spot.  Anticipating the six-lane toll road running the length of the park, Larry Smith, who helps maintain the campground, was quoted by the North County Times <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2006/01/29/news/coastal/23_36_071_28_06.txt">saying</a>:<blockquote><em>I could drive out onto the freeway, put my four-ways (flashers) and get the same experience.</em></blockquote></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>One Montana Senator, Republican Conrad Burns has already <a href="../../public_lands/index.html">vowed to kill</a> Bush's proposed sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land.  (Not coincidentally, Burns is up for re-election this year.)  The other Montana Senator, however, isn't getting complacent.  </p>

<p>Democrat Max Baucus held a townhall meeting Thursday&#151;a "call to arms"&#151;to urge citizens to stay vigilant and make sure Bush and his cronies don't sneak this unpopular proposal through the back channels of government.</p>

<p>As the Missoulian reported, Baucus said, “My experience in Washington is that it's never over until it's over and even then it's not over.  You can't assume anything.”</p>

<p>Indeed.  A nation-wide uproar killed the <a href="../../public_lands/index.html">Pombo-Gibbons</a> plan to sell public lands, yet here we are fighting virtually the same battle barely two months later.</p>

<p>Some highlights from Baucus' call-to-arms meeting from the <a href="http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2006/02/24/news/local/znews01.txt">Missoulian</a>:<blockquote><em>Dave Stalling of the Hellgate Hunters and Anglers Association said proposals to sell public lands bring Montana's sportsmen together like nothing else.</p>

<p>In a time when this country loses about 1.5 million acres of wildlife habitat a year to development, Stalling said, sportsmen don't support any proposal that culminates in a net loss of public lands. They do support exchanges which block up tracts of public lands, he said.</p>

<p>Ron Moody of Lewistown said it's time for Montana sportsmen to change from their traditional defensive posture to something more assertive in protecting public lands.</p>

<p>“Sportsmen should be working to not only keep what they've got, but working to make it bigger and better,” Moody said.</p>

<p>Moody said he's forming a political action group for Montana sportsmen that will work to hold politicians accountable for their stands on public lands. He wants to see a day when politicians don't use the gun card to placate Montana sportsmen.</p>

<p>“We don't have to give up our lands in order to keep our guns,” he said.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>If public lands are sold, [Mineral County Commissioner Judy] Stang said, it's doubtful that anyone local would be able to afford to buy them. Instead, the lands would be sold to the wealthy and the impact to county coffers would be negligible, she said.</p>

<p>“No one is going to be able to afford to buy these tracts except developers,” Stang said.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>A member of the Great Old Broads for Wilderness, Anna Marie Rider of Missoula, asked Baucus to carry a message back to Washington, D.C., to those proposing the sale of public lands.</p>

<p>“Ask them would they rather be hanged or sentenced to 20 years in Leavenworth?” Rider said. “I'd be willing to swat the horse ... just tell them to keep their paws off of our land.”</em></blockquote>Baucus had some advice for how to make sure our <a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/topic/article/6522/C74/L38">public lands remain in public hands</a>:<blockquote><em>He suggested that people call each representative weekly. They needed to ask to speak directly to the legislator and not be put off.</p>

<p>“You’re to say I’d like to talk to him right now,” Baucus instructed.</p>

<p>If they’re asked to leave a message, he told the crowd to inform the secretary they expected a call back. </p>

<p>“Then mark it on your calendar and call him back the next week,” he said.</p>

<p>Baucus encouraged them to keep it up until they spoke directly to the legislator.</p>

<p>“I can’t overemphasize how effective that is,” he said. It’s this type of grassroots movement that will change the mindset of those in Washington who want to sell off public land, he said.</em></blockquote>They're talking a lot of sense up there in Montana.</p>

And, unlike the other agencies, the EPA is not even pretending to change its policy.</p><p>On February 9, as Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) <a href="http://www.peer.org/news/news_id.php?row_id=645">discovered</a>, the EPA's news director for research and development, Ann Brown, sent an email to all staff saying:</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;We are asked to remind all employees that EPA's standard media procedure is to refer all media queries regarding ORD [Office of Research and Development] to Ann Brown, ORD News Director, prior to agreeing to or conducting any interviews. The purpose of this policy is to enable the Agency to clarify the request, and to ensure that the reporter talks with appropriate experts on science, budget, or administrative issues. Support for this policy also will allow reasonable time for appropriate management response.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>The timing is suggestive, coming several days <em>after</em> the <a href="nasa_humiliated.html">George Deutsch</a> flap at NASA became public. Who asked Ann Brown to remind EPA scientists that, unlike NASA, their policy wasn't going to change?</p><p>I suspect they are connected to the people who propose to cut the EPA's <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/articleview/3294/1/1?TopicID=1">library budget</a> by 80%—cuts that, left intact, would leave both the agency's staff and the general public &quot;without useful access to the agency's vast storehouse of information.&quot;</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The radio program, Earth and Sky, (which inexplicably is not aired in San Antonio) has an interview with MIT atmospheric scientist <a href="http://www.earthsky.org/humanworld/interviews.php?id=49345">Kerry Emanuel</a>, published on February 16. He discusses the <a href="climate_scienti.html">recent suggestions</a> that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), parent office to the National Weather Service, has been monitoring the contact its scientists have with the public and suppressing some scientific opinions. Emanuel says:</p><blockquote><p><em>I think there's little question that this [censorship] has been going. In the last year or so, I've had a number of colleagues in NOAA complaining about this. It takes different forms, and sometimes it's a bit subtle, but there's no question that they feel pressure to be very cautious about what they say on the issue of hurricanes and global warming. It's less clear exactly where this is coming from. We don't really know how high up in NOAA, or even if it's beyond NOAA.</em></p></blockquote><p>Emanuel claims that the NOAA censorship problem only concerns a few scientists:</p><blockquote><p><em>[M]y impression is that 99% of the scientific employees of NOAA have no problem at all, and are doing work that has no implications, no political implications. And they're left alone.  It's just the few that are doing things that the senior management doesn't approve of that have the problems.</em></p></blockquote><p>What problems do these chosen few have?</p><blockquote><p><em>I think that the most egregious cases that I know about have been when scientists have been contacted by somebody in the media, maybe a major television station, and an interview was set up, and these things have to be cleared with the NOAA, with the Department of Commerce press office, and they were just nixed. They were just basically told, &quot;no, you may not do this interview. End of story.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>Who are the chosen few that &quot;senior management doesn't approve of&quot;? A <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB114005281796075386.html?mod=todays_free_feature">Wall Street Journal</a> article from February 16 actually names two:</p><blockquote><p><em>Pieter Tans, a researcher who studies carbon dioxide at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., says public-affairs &quot;minders&quot; now sit in on more interviews, something that didn't happen before. He said he sees it as an attempt to control comments about the dangers of climate change.<br>...<br>Thomas Knutson, a research meteorologist with the agency's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, N.J., said he believes his views have been censored by the NOAA public-affairs office because of his view that global warming could be making hurricanes worse. Last October the public-affairs office said no to a scheduled interview with CNBC television, he said.<br>...<br>On another occasion, Dr. Knutson said he had been invited around the time of Hurricane Katrina to appear on a television show with Ron Reagan, the son of former President Reagan who is co-host of a show on MSNBC. But shortly before he was to appear, he got a voice mail from a person in public affairs. &quot;He said, 'The White House turned it down,'&quot; Dr. Knutson said.</em></p></blockquote><p>Emanuel is also concerned that NOAA, late last year, officially took sides in an area of considerable scientific controversy. In response to the super-active Atlantic hurricane season, the NOAA published an <a href="http://www.magazine.noaa.gov/stories/mag184.htm">article</a> in their official magazine titled &quot;NOAA ATTRIBUTES RECENT INCREASE IN HURRICANE ACTIVITY TO NATURALLY OCCURRING MULTI-DECADAL CLIMATE VARIABILITY.  In other words, they told the public not to link all this destruction and devastation to our changing climate&#151;it's just a natural cycle that we're currently cresting.</p><p>Yet it turns out that a significant number of scientists believe there is evidence suggesting that our warmer climate is already causing stronger hurricanes.&quot; Emanuel says:</p><blockquote><p><em>There is the problem of an agency, like NOAA or NASA, taking a very decided stance in something that, among scientists, is controversial. I've never seen that happen before. What would have happened if back in the 1980's, NOAA had held a press conference to say that there's no such thing as an ozone hole? I mean everyone would have been shocked that they would take a position in an ongoing debate like that. And yet they have done this with hurricanes and global warming. Although I understand that they have retracted that recently, and couched it in more, in looser terms.</em></p></blockquote><p>The Wall Street Journal article says that this retraction took place last week:</p><blockquote><p><em>Amid a growing outcry from climate researchers in its own ranks, the [NOAA] backed away from a statement it released after last year's powerful hurricane season that discounted any link to global warming. A corrected statement, which says some NOAA researchers disagree with that view, was posted to NOAA's Web site yesterday [February 15].</em></p></blockquote><p>The retraction appears to have taken the form of a footnote added to the end of the November article—in small print. I can't find any other reference to it in a more prominent place on NOAA's web site or amongst their press releases. The small print says:</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>*EDITOR’S NOTE:</strong> This consensus in this on-line magazine story represents the views of some NOAA hurricane researchers and forecasters, but does not necessarily represent the views of all NOAA scientists. It was not the intention of this article to discount the presence of a human-induced global warming element or to attempt to claim that such an element is not present. There is a robust, on-going discussion on hurricanes and climate change within NOAA and the scientific community. The headline and paragraph could have more clearly stated: <blockquote><p><strong>“Agreement Among Some NOAA Hurricane Researchers and Forecasters”</strong> There is agreement among a number of NOAA hurricane researchers and forecasters that recent increases in hurricane activity are primarily the result of natural fluctuations in the tropical climate system known as the tropical multi-decadal signal.”</p></blockquote></em></p></blockquote><p>Despite this rather weak correction, the original, misleading, headline and article still dominate on that web page, for future web surfers to stumble across. The editor's note is not even referred to until the concluding paragraphs. It can easily be missed altogether.</p><p>Emanuel, thanks to a &quot;strong statement&quot; issued by the head of NOAA recently, thinks the problems may be mostly in the past. I think he is way too optimistic.</p><p>NASA's administrator also issued a &quot;strong statement&quot; recently. But his bosses in the White House went ahead and replaced the infamous <a href="nasa_humiliated.html">George Deutsch</a> in the NASA press office with another scientific novice and <a href="http://www.nasawatch.com/archives/2006/02/nasa_pao_is_hir.html">political appointee</a>.</p><p>It appears that the Bushies do not have any intention of stepping back from their attempts to control the flow of information out of NASA, and so the fortunes for improving the similar climate at NOAA—much further away from the public eye—do not appear promising.</p><p>The head of NOAA has not even acknowledged that there is a problem, as Emanuel points out:</p><blockquote><p><em>Recently, the administrator of NOAA, Conrad Lautenbacher, issued a statement to his employees pretty much along those lines as well [scientific openness to the press]. Although he also denied that there was any wrong-doing, which [NASA Administrator Mike] Griffin did not do. And I think that was a mistake, because too many people know better.</em></p></blockquote><p>Mistake? Or a calculated move? No problems means no changes are necessary.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Opposition to Bush's proposed <a href="new_public_land.html">sell-off</a> of hundreds of thousands of acres of National Forest and other public land has already grown to the point where the sale is in <a href="http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2006/02/21/news/top/news01.txt">serious political trouble</a>.  At least two of Bush's own party-mates can't stand behind him on this.  And, of course, there are plenty of Democratic politicians willing to stand up to Bush on this.</p>

<p>GOP Senator <a href="http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/articles/2006/02/21/news/01burns.txt">Conrad Burns</a> of Montana:<blockquote><em>I have no interest in including the administration's proposal in my Interior bill.  It's dead in the water.</em></blockquote>Senator Burns' spokesman Matt Mackowiak:<blockquote><em>It would go directly to that subcommittee that he chairs.  As far as advancing through the subcommittee, it's just not going to happen.</em></blockquote>Dem Senator Max Baucus of Montana:<blockquote><em>Montanans, like most Westerners, feel strongly that selling off our public lands to the highest bidder is a very bad idea.</em></blockquote>Senator Baucus' spokesman Barrett Kaiser:<blockquote><em>[Senator Burns is] still concerned the administration could sneak this through in any number of ways.  It's a long process and anything could happen.</em></blockquote>GOP Senator <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-ap-land-sale,0,6404577.story?coll=sns-ap-nation-headlines">John Thune</a> of South Dakota:<blockquote><em>Funding our rural schools is very important, but it would be inappropriate to do so by selling parts of the Black Hills.  The Senate is already working on an alternative proposal that would reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools law, and I will work to pass this viable option that does not include selling off our nations public lands.</em></blockquote>Dem Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota:<blockquote><em>This Forest Service plan results in a one-time windfall of $800 million, but does not address the long-term and structural problems facing localities with large tracts of public lands.  Our schools are in desperate need of funding, but this just seems like slapping a Band-Aid on the problem.</em></blockquote>Some local officials, too, aren't wasting time voicing their opposition to Bush's new land scheme.  From <a href="http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/mld/myrtlebeachonline/13925004.htm">South Carolina</a>:<blockquote><em>The Berkeley County Council plans to formally protest the proposed sale of more than 1,000 acres in the county by the U.S. Forest Service.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"It's a part of our national heritage," Councilman Dennis Fish said. "There is nobody making any more land. We need to protect it."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>State Rep. David Umphlett, R-Moncks Corner, urged the County Council at a recent meeting to take action against the sale of the forest land and encouraged residents to write letters to Congress.</p>

<p>"Land is something that is hard to come by," Umphlett said. "Once you open up Pandora's box, you are not going to be able to close it."</em></blockquote>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.landusewatch.com/2006/02/20/more-on-bush-privatization-of-public-lands/">Land Use Watch</a> suggests that the Bush administration has not been truthful in its description of the land it wants to dispose of.</p>

<p>With the increasingly vocal, bipartisan, opposition, Bush's proposed land sale is so far following the <a href="../../2005/12/gops_public_lan.html">same path</a> trod so recently by a similar ploy from GOP Representatives Richard Pombo and Jim Gibbons.  If the public pressure keeps up, even the mighty power of the executive branch may not be able to keep this plan alive.</p>

<p>But we all know that Bush does not give up easily and does not play by the normal rules.  Senator Burns may drown this idea in his own subcommittee, but keep Senator Baucus' words in mind&#151;the Bushies could find another, more pliant, GOP Senator, heading a different subcommittee.  Anything can happen.</p>

		<a href="san_antonio_cit.html">San Antonio city council unanimously votes to rein in uncontrolled development</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The San Antonio city council is trying to make sure that real estate developers cannot claim exemptions to local laws, aka "vested rights," based on vague documents filed a decade or more ago.  Needless to say, real estate developers, who are used to ignoring local laws designed to preserve large trees and protect the quality of water runoff into our aquifers, are not happy about this.</p>

<p>The San Antonio Express-News reported on <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/environment/stories/MYSA021706.01A.COUNCIL.1d1f53ce.html">Friday</a>:<blockquote><em>The [unanimous] council vote capped more than a year of hearings by the Vested Rights Task Force and back-and-forth negotiations between developers, environmentalists, the city Planning Commission and city staffers. </p>

<p>The biggest point of contention for developers is a new site plan requirement that must be attached to a project's fair notice form, detailing the project's lot layout, general building footprint with approximate square footage, the amount of impervious cover and how the land will be used. </p>

<p>Developers argued that such a level of detail for single-phase developments usually isn't determined until much later in the life of a project, well after permit applications have been filed. </p>

<p>"Nobody does a site plan at the beginning of the process," said lobbyist Ken Brown, who spoke against the UDC amendments. "What's in place is perfectly fine."</em></blockquote>What lobbyist Brown does not mention is that "what's in place" allows developers to claim vested rights by pointing to a virtually blank plat filed decades previously by a different owner (35 years previously in a specific <a href="../01/vested_rights_a.html">case</a> I posted about last month).  "What's in place" allows developers virtually unlimited ability to ignore local laws.</p>

<p>What the city council is now requiring sounds like a reasonable alternative&#151;an alternative that may actually mean that communities have some control over how they grow.  The restrictions on developers are hardly unrealistic:<blockquote><em>The amendments will allow a developer to make changes to the number of buildings in a project within five years of filing fair notice and maintain vested rights, but only if the change does not increase the impervious cover and it does not increase the total square footage of the original project. </p>

<p>Developers also can make minor adjustments to a building footprint or changes to preserve trees without losing vested rights. </p>

<p>Councilman Art Hall said those provisions represented a middle ground of sorts by allowing some flexibility for developers to alter their plans. </p>

<p>"I think these are amendments both the environmental side and the development side can live with," he said.</em></blockquote>Given all the <a href="../../2005/04/extortion.html">friends</a> that the developers have in the Texas state government, though, I strongly suspect that they will continue to fight for total victory&#151;where communities are powerless to do anything to protect their own citizens from the negative effects of unchecked growth.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Few specific details are yet available about exactly where the hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands that Bush wants to sell off are located.  But in South Carolina, some of it consists of forest land near one of that state's "most visible and popular natural areas", according to <a href="http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/13874867.htm">The State</a>&#151;land that, if sold, would quickly be developed:<blockquote><em>Tourists often drive north on S.C. 107 through the heart of the Sumter National Forest to view the fall colors, visit Oconee State Park or raft on the Chattooga River. The scenery and the accessibility of the land would make the 470 acres of Forest Service land easy to market, real estate agents said Tuesday.</p>

<p>“It would sell overnight,” said Walhalla real estate agent John Powell, who opposes the sale. But “people are not going to drive here to see condominiums or houses or subdivisions.”</em></blockquote>Many who live in that area are not pleased about the possibility of their scenic mountains turning into standard-issue exurbia:<blockquote><em>Gwen Fowler, a real estate agent whose family has lived in Oconee County for generations, said national forest land boosts the value of that private property.</p>

<p>“This is like selling an heirloom your grandmother gave to you. I’ve had calls from people all day upset about this.”</em></blockquote>Once further details of this fire sale of public lands become available, I'm afraid that there will be many similar stories coming out.</p>

                                <p>The annual Great Backyard Bird Count is this weekend&#151;through Monday in fact.  To learn more, visit the official <a href="http://www.birdsource.org/gbbc/">web site</a>.  Anyone can join in.  It's a fun way for all those interested in birds to help scientists gather data to learn more about them.</p>

<p>It's rather cold and wet here in south central Texas, but we have every intention of participating&#151;just like <a href="../../2005/02/adventures_in_b.html">last year</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  Well, I sat outside, walked around a bit, a froze my feet off for an hour (its in the 30s here today, which is brutal for this part of the world).  Saw a few birds, but missed a few species that are quite common in our yard and neighborhood, such as Northern Mockingbird and Golden-fronted Woodpecker.</p>

<p>Below is the list we submitted for today.  We'll do it again tomorrow and probably Monday as well, when it should be a bit warmer.</p>

<p>2 House Finches<br />
2 Northern Cardinals<br />
2 Black-crested Titmice<br />
2 Carolina Chickadees<br />
1 Orange-crowned Warbler (visiting the feeder, strangely enough)<br />
7 White-winged doves<br />
1 Vulture, either Turkey or Black<br />
2 Western Scrub-Jays<br />
2 Lesser Goldfinches (unusual!)</p>
