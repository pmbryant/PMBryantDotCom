		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>These are scary times, knowing that the man currently residing in the oval office feels cornered — desperate in his refusal to change the course he set us on four years ago.&nbsp; Will we let him drag the country, the world, down with him?</p>

<p>From former Senator, current Presidential candidate, <a href="http://blog.johnedwards.com/story/2007/1/15/10479/0499">John Edwards</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">Almost 40 years ago the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stood at the pulpit in Riverside Church and, with the full force of his conscience, denounced the war in Vietnam -- calling it a &quot;tragedy that threatened to drag our nation down to dust.&quot;<br /><br />As Dr. King put it then, there comes a time when silence is a betrayal -- not only of one's personal convictions, or even of one's country alone, but also of our deeper obligations to humanity.<br /><br /><strong>Today, another president is trying to escalate another war. And once again, silence is betrayal.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Congress can stop Bush's escalation, but they'll only do so if the people demand it.</strong> That's why today -- in honor of the memory and courage of Martin Luther King -- I'm asking you to do two things:</span></p>

<ol><li><a href="http://johnedwards.com/r/5160/797417" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Join nearly 50,000 other Americans who have signed the petition calling on Congress to block funding for escalating the war in Iraq</span></strong></a><span style="color: #003300;">. </span></li>

<li><span style="color: #003300;">Tomorrow, when Congress returns to session, call your Senators directly and tell them to block funding for escalation. </span><a href="http://johnedwards.com/r/5161/797417" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Click here for your Senators' contact information</span></strong></a><span style="color: #003300;">. </span></li></ol>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Let's be clear: This is not a time for symbolic speech and hand-wringing from Washington. Congress has a very real choice to make -- either they fund Bush's escalation and he risks more American lives, or they don't, and we start to bring this war to a close.<br /><br />Every member of Congress is responsible for that choice -- if they know this war is going in the wrong direction and that escalation is wrong, it is no longer enough for them to study their options and keep their own counsel.<br /><br />But the ultimate responsibility for our country does not lie in Washington -- it lies with us. All of us who believe that Bush's plan to escalate the war is wrong for America, for Iraq, and for the world, must do more than hope for action in Washington -- we must take responsibility and act ourselves.<br /><br /><strong>Your urgent calls will help push the Senate to hold a vote on funding Bush's escalation</strong>, and we'll deliver your signatures to Congress to help ensure they cast the right vote when the time comes.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">George W. Bush has made it arrogantly clear he <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/14/AR2007011401027.html">plans to do</a> whatever he feels like doing, no matter what Congress or the people of this country say and think.&nbsp; But we still have to do what we can to stop him from making further mistakes with so many lives at stake.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">While, I'm using a message from a Democratic Presidential candidate to help make this point, this should not be a partisan issue.&nbsp; Plenty of Republicans, including numerous Republican Senators, such as Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, also believe that Bush's course is a dreadful mistake.&nbsp; </p>

		<a href="../../in_the_spring_o.html">Will America continue to be a leader in the study of our home planet?</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In the spring of 2005, a panel of the National Research Council of the National Academies of Science, interrupted its designated work to warn that the system of satellites that scientists use to study how our planet works was in danger of collapse. I covered their report and its aftermath extensively at the time. (For a review, see this <a href="../../../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">2005 post</a> and more posts <a href="../../../../science_earth/index.html">here</a>.)</p>

<p>Now, nearly two years later, the panel has completed its work on prioritizing future needs for Earth-observing satellites. And it has included a very similar warning.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/15/science/space/15cnd-nasa.html?hp&amp;ex=1168923600&amp;en=2ecb181905efaab0&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage">New York Times</a> today: </p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">The nation’s ability to track retreating polar ice, shifting patterns of drought, winds and rainfall and other environmental changes is being put “at great risk” by faltering efforts to replace aging satellite-borne sensors, a panel convened by the country’s leading scientific advisory group said.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">By 2010, the number of operating earth-observing instruments on NASA satellites, most of which are already past their planned lifetimes, will likely drop by 40 percent, the National Research Council of the National Academies warned in a report today.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The weakening of these monitoring efforts comes even as many scientists and the Bush administration have been stressing their growing importance, both to clarify risks from global warming and natural hazards and to track the condition of forests, fisheries, water and other resources on an increasingly crowded planet.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Several prominent scientists welcomed the report, saying that while the overall tightening of the federal budget played a role in threatening earth-observing efforts, a significant contributor was also President Bush’s recent call for NASA to focus on manned space missions.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">“NASA has a mission ordering that starts with the presidential goals -- first of manned flight to Mars, and second establishing a permanent base on the moon, and then third to examine Earth, which puts Earth rather far down on the totem pole,” said F. Sherwood Rowland, an atmospheric chemist at the University of California at Irvine, who shared a Nobel prize for identifying threats to the ozone layer.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">“This is the most critical time in human history, with the population never before so big and with stresses growing on the earth,” [co-chairman of the committee that wrote the report and the new president of the American Meteorological Society, Dr. Richard] Anthes said. “We just want to get back to the United States being a leader instead of someone you can’t count on.”</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>In addition to preventing a degradation in our ability to forecast such potentially devastating events, the report reiterates that a strong system of Earth-observing satellites is imperative to help address the questions that those of many of us stuck here on the planet Earth will find crucial to our future well-being. Their list of key questions includes:</p><blockquote><ul><li>Will there be catastrophic collapse of the major ice sheets, including Greeland and West Antarctic, and, if so, how rapidly will this occur? What will be the time patterns of sea level rise as a result?</li>

<li>Will droughts become more widespread in the western U.S., Australia, and Sub Saharan Africa? ... How will reduced amounts of snowfall change the needs for water storage?</li>

<li>How will continuing economic development affect the production of air pollutants, and how will these pollutants be transported across oceans and continents?</li>

<li>How will coastal and ocean ecosystems respond to changes in physical forcing, particularly those subject to intense human harvesting?</li>

<li>Will tropical cyclones and heat waves become more frequent and more intense?</li></ul></blockquote><p>The full report is already <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11820.html">online</a>, and I plan to post more about this when I have the chance to examine it in more detail. But here is one ominous statement from the Executive Summary (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p>[T]here is substantial concern that substitution of passive microwave sensor data for active scatterometry data will <strong>worsen El Nino and hurricane forecasts</strong> and weather forecasts in coastal areas.</p></blockquote><p>Not only failing to improve hurricane forecasts, but worsening them?&nbsp; This is not a situation that, in the wake of Katrina, we be permit. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Fulfilling <a href="../../../../2006/12/will_legislatur.html">expectations</a> that have been building over the last few months, the long-festering budget crisis in the Texas state parks system is receiving a lot of early attention in the new session of the Texas legislature.</p>

<p>From the <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/outdoors/tompkins/4462290.html">Houston Chronicle</a> late Wednesday (emphasis added):</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">Advocates of improving funding for Texas state and local parks had to smile earlier this week when a much-anticipated bill addressing park funding was filed for consideration by the Texas Legislature.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The bill, sponsored by Rep. Harvey Hilderbran, R-Kerrville, was designated as <strong>House Bill 6</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">In the tradition-bound world of the Texas Legislature, only bills considered by leadership to be of <strong>considerable statewide importance</strong> are given single-digit numbers.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">That Hilderbran's bill drew such a low number indicates it will have <strong>high priority</strong> in the 80th session.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">... </span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The annual operating budget of TPWD's state parks division is about $56 million, making Texas 49th in the nation in per-capita park funding.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #003300;">Under Hilderbran's bill, that funding would greatly increase, going from the current annual maximum of $32 million to approximately $105 million.</span></strong></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Hilderbran has filed the same bill in previous sessions recently, including in 2005. But the bill went nowhere then. This year looks to be different. It's already up to <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/Authors.aspx?LegSess=80R&amp;Bill=HB6">70 &quot;coauthors&quot;</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA011207.05A.state_parks.343f301.html">San Antonio Express-News</a> has some quotes:</p>

<ul dir="ltr"><li><div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">From Rep. Hilderbran: &quot;&quot;The primary goal is to restore our Texas parks system to excellence. We also want to strengthen the management practices of the department and create greater funding opportunities for local parks.&quot;</div></li>

<li><div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">From George Bristol, vice chairman of the Texas State Parks Advisory Committee and president of the <a href="http://www.texascoa.org/">Texas Coalition for Conservation</a>: &quot;We feel very confident and a great deal of pride that this bill will go a long way toward meeting the needs of a state park system that attracts a lot of visitors from out-of-state and even around the world.&quot;</div></li>

<li><div style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">From conservative GOP Rep. Debbie Riddle: &quot;Our parks are a natural resource that we need to protect. We need to make sure that our children and our children's children have those parks. It's important for families, especially from our urban areas, to have a place where you can go to enjoy nature.&quot; (Interestingly, she's not listed as a &quot;coauthor&quot; yet.)</div></li></ul>

<p>One voice that doesn't appear ready to jump on the bandwagon of fully funding our state parks system is that of our Governor, Rick Perry -- the fellow who somehow won re-election in November with 39% of the vote.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/news/legislature/16444735.htm">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a> interviewed Gov. Perry on this and other subjects yesterday (emphasis added):</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">During the 30-minute interview, Perry said there was no question that the 600,000-acre state parks system needs more money, but he <strong>questioned </strong>whether the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department could <strong>efficiently</strong> <strong>spend</strong> the roughly <strong>$80 million</strong> in extra money that would accrue from a parks funding bill filed this week in the Texas House.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Instead, he suggested that some of that money could flow back to anglers, hunters and wildlife enthusiasts in the form of rebates when they buy sporting goods. &quot;We need a way to make a rebate back to Texans,&quot; he said.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Contrast Perry's words with last years' report of the <a href="http://www.traps.org/forms/StateParkAdvisoryCommittee8-24-06.pdf">Texas State Parks Advisory Committee</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;After working extensively with Texas Parks and Wildlife Staff, the Advisory Committee has identified approximately $100 million in additional annual needs.&quot;</p>

<p>The bulk of these additional needs are just to address the repair and maintenance backlog. 35 million dollars of this is for acquisition of new parks (15 million) and for local park grants (20 million). Without such programs, it will be impossible to maintain a parks system worthy of this state into the future. </p>

<p>From the Advisory Committee's report (emphasis added): &quot;The population of the state of Texas is growing at a rapid pace, yet there has not been a major acquisition and development financing package for state parks undertaken since 1967.&quot; And, &quot;The Texas Recreation and Park Account, commonly known as the local grant program, has suffered the bulk of reductions in appropriations from the sporting goods tax in recent years, <strong>falling from $15.5 million to about $5 million</strong> in the current biennium.&quot; That's 21 cents per Texas resident! The Advisory Committee's recommendation brings this up to a buck per resident every two years.</p>

<p>Hopefully Perry wail fail in his efforts to prevent full funding of our parks system.&nbsp; The political moment has come, and we have to take advantage of it now to save our parks. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Alas, Tom Craddick retained his position as Texas speaker on Tuesday over his fellow Republican, Jim Pitts -- with the support of 15 Democrats in addition to all but a dozen or so Republicans. </p>

<p>I believe it was a <a href="../../pitts_r_v_cradd.html">mistake</a> for progressives to try to turn the choice of Pitts (and <a href="../../../../2006/12/power_struggle_.html">earlier</a>, Republican Brian McCall) into a litmus test for Democratic legislators, an effort which many of my fellow Texas political bloggers drove. In fact, this effort may have contributed to Pitts' defeat, as it likely helped make Republican legislators wary of publicly joining the Pitts forces. These GOPers may have feared a primary challenge funded by Craddick allies, but such a challenge would have been more likely to succeed due to the vocally Democratic nature of the McCall/Pitts coalition.</p>

<p>Texas Monthly's <a href="http://www.texasmonthly.com/community/blog/paulburka/2007/01/just-wondering.php">Paul Burka</a> summarized this point on Thursday:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">The fatal flaw of the McCall/Pitts challenge to Tom Craddick was that it was based on Democrats. The theory was that with most of the Democrats and fourth to a third of the Republicans, a challenge to Craddick would be successful. The problem was that the more successful they were in recruiting Democrats, the harder it became to atract Republicans beyond the dozen or so ABCs [Anyone-But-Craddick]. </span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>If the situation were reversed, Dem activists could understand why Dem legislators would be very hesitant to join up with a coalition dominated by Republicans in ousting their incumbent Dem Speaker. In fact, in such a situation, these activists would likely be driving primary challenges to any Dem legislators who joined such a Republican-dominated coalition.</p>

<p>So now, as progressive activists and bloggers consider <a href="http://burntorangereport.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=2679">fueling</a> primary challenges against the 15 Craddick Dems (another mistake at this point, in my opinion), the irony is that if there had been <em>more</em> Craddick Dems, Craddick may well have lost his position.</p>

                                <p>A water fight is brewing over the Edwards Aquifer. More accurately, this fight has been brewing for many years, but is set to flare up in this legislative session.

<p>January 10: <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/columnists/cguerra/stories/MYSA011107.01B.Guerra.2e785c2.html">Would setting higher pumping cap on Edwards hurt conservation?</a></p>

<p>This series is inspired by a proposal by GOP state Senator Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio to officially raise the cap on the amount of water that can be pumped out of the Edwards aquifer by &quot;a whopping&quot; 22%, making it consistent with the amount of pumping permits that the Edwards Aquifer Authority (EAA) was required to issue based on historical use. The EAA accounted for the difference between the cap and the actual amount of pumping permitted by declaring some of the permits &quot;junior&quot; to the others and requiring those pumping rights to be suspended during times of shortage. Apparently, an Attorney General's opinion earlier this week may invalidate this two-tiered system of permits.</p>

<p>The cap is set where it is for a good reason -- because pumping more water lowers the level of the Edwards below the point where several prodigious springs in central Texas, such as San Marcos springs, flow significantly. This results in a shortage of water downstream. So while we hear a lot about how drying up the springs will hurt certain endangered species and harm ecosystems along the rivers, what this really boils down to is a fight with San Antonio Water System (SAWS) and Hill Country real estate developers on one side and downstream users on the other side.</p>

<p>Guerra quotes Dianne Wassenich of the San Marcos River Foundation in the January 5 article:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">Yes, this water is very important to us in Central Texas who use it as groundwater. But it is also very important to cities that have springs and rivers that flow through them, and to communities and ranchers all the way down to the coast. And at the coast, you have wildlife, ecotourism and the fishing industry.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Guerra also notes that the massive development boom on the land which feeds the Edwards aquifer is threatening the quality of this water in dispute.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">&quot;It's crazy,&quot; Wassenich says. &quot;Here we are, destroying the very recharge zone through which water of good quality, in good quantity, is flowing into the aquifer. &quot;We're destroying that very capability while we're worrying about not having enough water. It just doesn't make any sense.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>For more background, see my 2005 post on <a href="../../../../2005/04/edwards_aquifer.html">Edwards aquifer politics</a> and Gregg Eckhardt's comprehensive <a href="http://www.edwardsaquifer.net/">edwardsaquifer.net</a> website.

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The power struggle for the position of Speaker of the Texas House of Representatives will be decided tomorrow, when the next session of the Texas legislature opens in Austin. It is now down to a choice between the incumbent speaker Tom Craddick of Midland and fellow Republican Jim Pitts of Waxahachie.</p>

<p>On some <a href="http://www.mcblogger.com/archives/2007/01/but_children_ar.html">progressive</a> Texas blogs, there is a sentiment to turn this GOP civil war into a Democratic civil war. One of the most explicit statements of this viewpoint was posted on <a href="http://www.burntorangereport.com/frontPage.do">Burnt Orange Report</a> today by Karl-Thomas Musselman: &quot;If [the 10 Democrats pledged to Craddick] follow through and vote for him tomorrow, expect primary challengers to find this footage [of them attending a dinner in support of Craddick] available to them.&quot;</p>

<p>Reading numerous like-minded comments over the last couple weeks, I was put off. This internal GOP battle should not be turned into Democratic litmus test, I thought. After all, this is a choice between two conservative Republicans, neither of whom would likely be friendly to a Democratic agenda.</p>

<p>But reading this <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4452221.html">article</a> in the Houston Chronicle, I began to have second thoughts, as I was reminded that many of the major &quot;bad guys&quot; (big, monied, special interests) in Texas politics have so much invested in Craddick as the GOP leader, that his loss, even to a fellow conservative Republican, has the potential to be major victory for the rest of us.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Yet this article also points out that some of these same big money special interests, such as real estate mogul Bob Perry, are also heavily invested in Jim Pitts.&nbsp; Given the nature of his coalition, though, a Pitts speakership seems likely to give rise to policies closer to the will of the people of this state than a Craddick one.&nbsp; </p>

<p>So it comes down to this: I would love to see Craddick go down to defeat tomorrow at the hands of Pitts. But I would advise fellow Democrats to not turn this choice between two conservative Republicans into a litmus test for Democratic politicians. Instead, judge them by how they perform for Texas citizens during the rest of this upcoming session.</p>

                                <p>Today was a historic day as Nancy Pelosi was elected the first female Speaker of the House in our nation's entire history.&nbsp; From the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/04/AR2007010400802.html">Washington Post</a>:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/p000197/"><span style="color: #003300;">Rep. Nancy Pelosi</span></a><span style="color: #003300;"> (D-Calif.) was sworn in today as the first female speaker of the House in U.S. history, as Democrats formally took control of Congress for the first time in a dozen years and immediately set their sights on quick passage of ethics legislation.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Pelosi, 66, took the oath of office at 2:30 p.m. EST after winning election as speaker in a straight party-line vote that reflected the Democrats' 233-202 House majority in the new 110th Congress. </span><a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/b000589/"><span style="color: #003300;">Rep. John A. Boehner</span></a><span style="color: #003300;"> (R-Ohio) became House minority leader.</span></p>

John Dingell</span></a><span style="color: #003300;"> (D-Mich.), the longest-serving House member, Pelosi pledged in a speech to work in bipartisan fashion toward ending the war in Iraq, reining in deficit spending and raising ethical standards among lawmakers, among other goals.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">Hailing her election to the speakership as a &quot;historic moment for the women of America,&quot; Pelosi declared, &quot;For our daughters and granddaughters, today we have broken the marble ceiling. . . .

Anything is possible.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">As former House Majority leader, now Minority Leader, Republican John Boehner said in introducing Pelosi, &quot;Today is a cause for celebration.&quot;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">But while we celebrate, let's not forget that, despite the lofty rhetoric, chronic problems <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/24/business/24gap.html?ei=5070&amp;en=01c80903e6a9872f&amp;ex=1168146000&amp;emc=eta1&amp;pagewanted=all">remain</a> -- the sky is not yet the limit.&nbsp; And if anything is to be possible for our daughters and graddaughters, we still have a lot of work to do.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Prior to New Years', there was a flurry of alarm across the &quot;reality-based&quot; neck of the blogosphere when the group Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER) put out a <a href="http://www.peer.org/news/news_id.php?row_id=801">press release</a> with two outrageous complaints:&nbsp; that National Park Service employees at Grand Canyon National Park were not permitted to discuss the scientific age of the Grand Canyon with visitors, and that the bookstore at the National Park had been selling a book espousing the story that the canyon was created by the biblical Noah's flood for three years and had never conducted a promised review of the decision to carry the book.</p>

<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/12/29/grand-canyon-national-park-is-not-permitted/">Think Progress</a>, <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/12/the_grand_canyon_is_how_old.php">Pharyngula</a>, and <a href="http://www.badastronomy.com/bablog/2006/12/29/bush-white-house-still-promoting-creationism/">Bad Astronomy Blog</a>, to pick a few of the more prominent blogs, pointed to this story in outrage.&nbsp; Now, some inquiries by <a href="http://nationalparkstraveler.typepad.com/national_parks_traveler/2007/01/god_geology_and.html">National Parks Traveler</a> and <a href="https://parkrangerx.blogspot.com/2007/01/dont-believe-everything-you-read.html">Park Ranger X</a> strongly suggest that the first, and most outrageous, allegation is false.&nbsp; Park Ranger X excerpts part of the official response from the National Park Service:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span style="color: #003300;">If asked the age of the Grand Canyon, our rangers use the following answer. The principal consensus among geologists is that the Colorado River basin has developed in the past 40 million years and that the Grand Canyon itself is probably less than five to six million years old. The result of all this erosion is one of the most complete geologic columns on the planet. The major geologic exposures in Grand Canyon range in age from the 2 billion year old Vishnu Schist at the bottom of the Inner Gorge to the 230 million year old Kaibab Limestone on the Rim.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Park Ranger X adds, &quot;I've emailed a few of my contacts at GRCA, and so far, all deny any conspiracy and all freely give the canyon's age in education programs.&quot;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">There appears to be nothing for the reality-based community to object to here.&nbsp; Indeed, if the NPS were not allowed to give an &quot;official&quot; response about the age of the canyon, why would there be a prominently linked page of &quot;<a href="http://www.nps.gov/grca/faqs.htm#old">frequently asked questions</a>&quot; at the official Grand Canyon National Park website that includes the following:</span></p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">How old is the Canyon?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">That's a tricky question. Although rocks exposed in the walls of the canyon are geologically quite old, the Canyon itself is a fairly young feature. The oldest rocks at the canyon bottom are close to 2000 million years old. The Canyon itself - an erosional feature - has formed only in the past five or six million years. Geologically speaking, Grand Canyon is very young.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr">PEER's first complaint appears completely unwarranted.&nbsp; The second complaint, about the selling of the creationist book, while more substantive, is perhaps overblown, as National Parks Traveler <a href="http://nationalparkstraveler.typepad.com/national_parks_traveler/2007/01/god_geology_and.html">explains</a> by comparing the creationist book to other books, also sold at national parks, containing Native American lore about the formation of geologic features.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A more compelling complaint than this would be about a recent dumbing-down of interpretive exhibits at popular national parks.&nbsp; On New Year's, Pharyngula excerpted a <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2007/01/science_and_the_national_park.php">letter</a> to Science magazine from a recent visitor to the canyon from late 2005 that reads:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #003300;">The modern visitor center [at Grand Canyon National Park] was architecturally magnificent but intellectually vacuous. With open spaces and giant images, it emphasized only the aesthetic experience. There was homage to John Wesley Powell, the man who carried out early explorations of the canyon and helped found the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Geographic Society. Yet the principles he so strongly promoted--rationalism and scientific curiosity as a means of appreciating the world and improving human welfare--were being relegated to obscurity. Schmidt notes that on viewing the canyon we ask, &quot;How did this happen?&quot; The current displays and signage at the Grand Canyon do their best to avoid any such question. As we left the park, we stopped to watch the sunrise at Desert View, a popular site. The most prominent sign at the overlook addressed only the visual beauty of the canyon and the religious significance of a distant mountain to Native Americans. One paragraph began, &quot;The landscape seems consciously designed.&quot;</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #000000;">Along these lines, the official Grand Canyon National Park website also appears to have been diluted of much of its hard, scientific info at some point.&nbsp; Compare the current &quot;<a href="http://www.nps.gov/grca/naturescience/naturalfeaturesandecosystems.htm">Natural Features and Ecosystems</a>&quot; page, which consists of a mere four paragraphs (two quite short), to an archived version I found using their search engine, which is split up into ten sub-sections on various topics, of which the &quot;<a href="http://www.nps.gov/archive/grca/pphtml/subnaturalfeatures14.html">Geologic Features</a>&quot; page alone contains seven detailed paragraphs. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Bush's NPS is apparently making it harder for visitors to learn about the detailed natural history of our nation's wonders.&nbsp; This needs to be corrected.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>During the six years I lived in California, the Owens Valley came to hold a special place in my heart. Though I have not set foot in it for over ten years, it still does. So, while in the midst of the final days of the Ciro Rodriguez campaign a month ago, I was pleased to hear some exciting news regarding this valley's river, whose water has until now been virtually completely siphoned off into an aqueduct to flow south to distant Los Angeles — High Sierra water is flowing again in the lower Owens River for the first time in nearly a century!</p>

<p>The Owens Valley is a 10,000-foot deep, spectacularly scenic valley in the rain shadow of the high peaks of the Sierra Nevada. Despite its lack of precipitation, it contains a major river that drains the prodigious snows of these mountains. This river's water was tapped in the early 1900s by the city of Los Angeles's Department of Water and Power (DWP) in a notorious feat of underhandedness and engineering -- piping the river's water over hundreds of miles of desert to fuel the city's growth.</p>

<p>Over the years, the residents of the Owens Valley fought back against Los Angeles, at times sabotaging the aqueduct to attempt to save the water for their own agricultural ambitions. Over the years, they lost battle after battle after battle. The large, shallow Owens Lake at the south end of the valley soon dried up, leaving a vast plain of salt deposits that blow up a toxic storm in the desert winds.</p>

<p>Eventually, Los Angeles, in its quest for even more water, extended the aquifer north to tap into the creeks that fed Mono Lake, causing that lake, too, to slowly dry up. That wasn't enough. It later increased the capacity of the Owens River aqueduct and even pumped the groundwater out from under the Owens Valley.</p>

<p>All that was left of the century-old dreams of an agricultural empire in the shadow on Mt. Whitney was a vast open dessicated desert valley, whose life-sustaining water silently flowed down a contrete ditch south to a distant megalopolis.</p>

<p>Starting in 1994, though, the tide began to turn, if only just a little. After a long battle by activists to prevent the death of the fascinating ecosystem at Mono Lake, a state agency ordered L.A. to limit its intake of the lake's feeder creeks and allow the lake to rise to a level that would allow it to live on.</p>

<p>In recent years, he city has also been forced to limit its groundwater pumping and re-water a small portion of the dry bed of Owens Lake to help cut down on the severity of the dust storms.</p>

<p>Now, Los Angeles has been forced to return a fraction of the water flow to the bed of the Owens River itself. The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-owens7dec07,0,3020398.story?coll=la-home-headlines">Los Angeles Times</a> reported on December 7:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">Against a backdrop of lofty snowcapped peaks, about 500 spectators, led by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, gathered Wednesday [December 6] to watch the Lower Owens River ripple anew with its first surge of High Sierra water in nearly a century.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The largest river habitat restoration effort ever attempted in the West was jump-started at 12:15 p.m., when Villaraigosa turned a control knob to open a new clamshell-shaped steel gate at a diversion dam that has been directing the waters that have flowed into the Los Angeles Aqueduct since 1913.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">...</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">By the time Villaraigosa was heading home in a chartered jet after the hourlong ceremony, the water had traveled roughly half a mile, meandering around a bend, past clots of dusty sagebrush.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">It will sweep past the skeletal gray arms of dead cottonwood trees, and through dry zones and broad spring-fed beaver ponds choked with cattails and harboring largemouth bass and catfish, which are expected to spawn hordes of fish in the rehabilitated river.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">The water will take about 16 days to traverse the vast Owens Valley floodplain flanked by the High Sierra on the west and the White and Inyo mountains on the east, and pour into storage ponds on the northern edge of the dry Owens Lake.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">There, four 600-horsepower pumps will draw the water up and put it back into the aqueduct's ribbon of concrete and steel for transport to Los Angeles, about 250 miles to the south.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #003300;">If all goes according to plan, within five years nature will transform the revived river's lazy loops into an oasis of willows and cottonwood trees; wetlands for waterfowl and shorebirds, and warm water fisheries for bass, catfish, frogs and crayfish.</span></p></blockquote></blockquote><p>Los Angeles, despite all the good feelings in its rhetoric, still had to be forced to do the right thing by a state judge fining them over $2 million -- quite a bit resistance for an action that &quot;is not expected to result in a significant loss of water or in a rate hike for DWP customers.&quot; Still, L.A. and the DWP appear to finally be on the right track.</p>

<p>An article in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/19/AR2006121901660.html">Washington Post</a> from just before the holidays reminds us what has made this sea change possible (emphasis added):</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><span style="color: #003300;">The city's water <strong>conservation efforts</strong> have been some of the most successful in the nation; over the past 20 years, while Los Angeles has added 750,000 homes, its water consumption has remained the same.
