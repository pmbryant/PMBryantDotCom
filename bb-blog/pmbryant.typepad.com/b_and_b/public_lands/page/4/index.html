		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Is the <a href="../../../2005/12/texas_state_par.html">dire situation</a> of the Texas state park system getting through to the members of the Texas legislature? An article in yesterday's <a href="http://www.statesman.com/sports/content/sports/stories/outdoors/02/20parks.html">Austin American-Statesman</a> suggests that the answer is 'maybe—but don't count on it.'</p><blockquote><p><em>Texas state parks are funded primarily by a statewide sales tax on sporting goods, which generates about $105 million a year.<br /><br />The share for parks, however, has been capped by the Texas Legislature at $32 million, and even that number has been cut during a recent run of tight state budgets. The other $70 million is used for general state spending.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Rep. Edmund Kuempel, R-Seguin, former chairman of the House committee responsible for Parks and Wildlife oversight, said there is a chance the department could receive more money next year — but not from the sporting goods tax.<br /><br />&quot;That I would doubt very seriously,&quot; Kuempel said. &quot;Our first step will be to get (funding) back to where we were. Raising the cap is going to be a tough row to hoe.<br /><br />&quot;We should have been funding (state parks) at the cap level, but as money got tougher, (the Legislature) used the money to balance the budget. There was no anti-Parks and Wildlife sentiment,&quot; he said. &quot;We swept funds from a lot of agencies.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p>If this statement was intended to make parks supporters feel better, I don't think it worked well.</p>



<p>Another Republican representative, Harvey Hildebran of Kerrville, is trying to get the cap on state parks' share of the sporting goods sales tax raised to $85 million. Explaining why he was unable to get that measure passed in the last session, he says:</p><blockquote><p><em>We had a lot of media and public support for it. Builders and developers were for it. The problem was, we didn't have the support in key positions in committee. The action wasn't as strong as the words.</em></p></blockquote><p>Builders and developers were for it! It is sadly typical of our GOP legislators (and a few Dems as well) to place such importance on the opinions of real estate developers.</p>



<p>I have to admit that I wasn't fully aware of the crisis in our state parks <a href="http://www.texascoa.org/news/ar_040205.php">at the time</a> Hildebran was trying to push his measure through. I was following several issues (out of many potentially disastrous bills) in the state legislature back in the spring of 2005, but this one never hit my radar screen. Next time around will be different, and it will be nice to be on the same side as the 'builders and developers' for once.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>An op-ed published by the Houston Chronicle last weekend serves as an excellent reminder of the ultimate goal of those in the GOP who desire to privatize our public lands. The Cato Institute authors <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/outlook/3687139.html">write</a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>Some object to privatization because they believe that our national &quot;crown jewels&quot; (however defined) are sacred natural treasures and that no price tag can or should be attached to them. Well, one is welcome to one's beliefs, but value is subjective. Land is worth only what people will pay for it.</em></p></blockquote><p>They also write:</p><blockquote><p><em>If there is more money to be made by turning the Grand Canyon over to the Walt Disney Co. rather than to an eco-sensitive tourism cooperative, it simply means that the public demand for Disney's services at the Grand Canyon is greater than the public's demand for Deep Green Trail Services Inc.</em></p></blockquote><p>This is a philosophy that places zero value on public land of any kind—in fact, zero value on anything non-monetary.&nbsp; &quot;Turning the Grand Canyon over&quot; to a private enterprise, whatever its marketing angle, is taken for granted.</p>
<p>In this world, there are no National Forests, no National Parks. &quot;<a href="http://www.hehd.clemson.edu/PRTM/textonly/Hartzog.htm">America's greatest idea</a>&quot; is no more.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Texas <a href="../../../2006/02/texans_for_stat.html">state parks</a> are in a budget crisis, years in the making, that has become particularly acute in recent months&#151;necessitating substantial reductions in park hours as well as staff layoffs.</p>

<p>But one problem we don't currently have is the imminent threat of a new superhighway running the length of one of our most popular state parks.  Unfortunately, in southern California, such a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tollway24feb24,1,2284619.story?coll=la-headlines-california">threat</a> is very real.<blockquote><em>Over the objections of environmentalists and state officials, directors of Orange County's toll road agency on Thursday approved construction of a six-lane highway through San Onofre State Beach — a popular coastal park that President Nixon helped set aside in 1970 as a haven from urbanization.</p>

<p>The 16-mile project, which has drawn a lukewarm response from the Schwarzenegger administration, also would pass through the Donna O'Neill Land Conservancy, a 1,200-acre open-space preserve created by Rancho Mission Viejo, one of the largest landholders in southern Orange County.</p>

<p>If the highway is built, it will be by far the largest project of its kind put through a state park.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>With 2.7 million visitors a year, San Onofre is the fifth most popular destination in the state's 278-park system. It contains endangered species, archeological sites, campgrounds, panoramic views of the sea and world-renowned surf spots.</p>

<p>When the San Diego County park was created in 1970, [President] Nixon noted the beauty of the landscape and said he did not want the pressures of population growth "to clutter up" the park.</p>

<p>"We must leave a legacy that goes beyond good housing, vital industries and strong defense," he said.</p>

<p>The proposed highway would split the northern part of San Onofre lengthwise before crossing over a marine estuary set aside as a nature preserve.</em></blockquote>Ronald Reagan, then Governor of California, was with President Nixon at the park dedication in 1971.  He <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2006/01/29/news/coastal/23_36_071_28_06.txt">declared</a>, "I firmly believe one of the greatest legacies we can leave to future generations is the heritage of our land, but unless we can preserve and protect the unspoiled areas which God has given us, we will have nothing to leave them."</p>

<p>The people who currently enjoy camping at San Onofre are not thinking "unspoiled" will long describe this spot.  Anticipating the six-lane toll road running the length of the park, Larry Smith, who helps maintain the campground, was quoted by the North County Times <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2006/01/29/news/coastal/23_36_071_28_06.txt">saying</a>:<blockquote><em>I could drive out onto the freeway, put my four-ways (flashers) and get the same experience.</em></blockquote></p>

                                <p>One Montana Senator, Republican Conrad Burns has already <a href="../../index.html">vowed to kill</a> Bush's proposed sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land.  (Not coincidentally, Burns is up for re-election this year.)  The other Montana Senator, however, isn't getting complacent.  </p>

<p>Democrat Max Baucus held a townhall meeting Thursday&#151;a "call to arms"&#151;to urge citizens to stay vigilant and make sure Bush and his cronies don't sneak this unpopular proposal through the back channels of government.</p>

<p>As the Missoulian reported, Baucus said, “My experience in Washington is that it's never over until it's over and even then it's not over.  You can't assume anything.”</p>

<p>Indeed.  A nation-wide uproar killed the <a href="../../index.html">Pombo-Gibbons</a> plan to sell public lands, yet here we are fighting virtually the same battle barely two months later.</p>

<p>Some highlights from Baucus' call-to-arms meeting from the <a href="http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2006/02/24/news/local/znews01.txt">Missoulian</a>:<blockquote><em>Dave Stalling of the Hellgate Hunters and Anglers Association said proposals to sell public lands bring Montana's sportsmen together like nothing else.</p>

<p>In a time when this country loses about 1.5 million acres of wildlife habitat a year to development, Stalling said, sportsmen don't support any proposal that culminates in a net loss of public lands. They do support exchanges which block up tracts of public lands, he said.</p>

<p>Ron Moody of Lewistown said it's time for Montana sportsmen to change from their traditional defensive posture to something more assertive in protecting public lands.</p>

<p>“Sportsmen should be working to not only keep what they've got, but working to make it bigger and better,” Moody said.</p>

<p>Moody said he's forming a political action group for Montana sportsmen that will work to hold politicians accountable for their stands on public lands. He wants to see a day when politicians don't use the gun card to placate Montana sportsmen.</p>

<p>“We don't have to give up our lands in order to keep our guns,” he said.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>If public lands are sold, [Mineral County Commissioner Judy] Stang said, it's doubtful that anyone local would be able to afford to buy them. Instead, the lands would be sold to the wealthy and the impact to county coffers would be negligible, she said.</p>

<p>“No one is going to be able to afford to buy these tracts except developers,” Stang said.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>A member of the Great Old Broads for Wilderness, Anna Marie Rider of Missoula, asked Baucus to carry a message back to Washington, D.C., to those proposing the sale of public lands.</p>

<p>“Ask them would they rather be hanged or sentenced to 20 years in Leavenworth?” Rider said. “I'd be willing to swat the horse ... just tell them to keep their paws off of our land.”</em></blockquote>Baucus had some advice for how to make sure our <a href="http://www.newwest.net/index.php/topic/article/6522/C74/L38">public lands remain in public hands</a>:<blockquote><em>He suggested that people call each representative weekly. They needed to ask to speak directly to the legislator and not be put off.</p>

<p>“You’re to say I’d like to talk to him right now,” Baucus instructed.</p>

<p>If they’re asked to leave a message, he told the crowd to inform the secretary they expected a call back. </p>

<p>“Then mark it on your calendar and call him back the next week,” he said.</p>

<p>Baucus encouraged them to keep it up until they spoke directly to the legislator.</p>

<p>“I can’t overemphasize how effective that is,” he said. It’s this type of grassroots movement that will change the mindset of those in Washington who want to sell off public land, he said.</em></blockquote>They're talking a lot of sense up there in Montana.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Opposition to Bush's proposed <a href="../../../2006/02/new_public_land.html">sell-off</a> of hundreds of thousands of acres of National Forest and other public land has already grown to the point where the sale is in <a href="http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2006/02/21/news/top/news01.txt">serious political trouble</a>.  At least two of Bush's own party-mates can't stand behind him on this.  And, of course, there are plenty of Democratic politicians willing to stand up to Bush on this.</p>

<p>GOP Senator <a href="http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/articles/2006/02/21/news/01burns.txt">Conrad Burns</a> of Montana:<blockquote><em>I have no interest in including the administration's proposal in my Interior bill.  It's dead in the water.</em></blockquote>Senator Burns' spokesman Matt Mackowiak:<blockquote><em>It would go directly to that subcommittee that he chairs.  As far as advancing through the subcommittee, it's just not going to happen.</em></blockquote>Dem Senator Max Baucus of Montana:<blockquote><em>Montanans, like most Westerners, feel strongly that selling off our public lands to the highest bidder is a very bad idea.</em></blockquote>Senator Baucus' spokesman Barrett Kaiser:<blockquote><em>[Senator Burns is] still concerned the administration could sneak this through in any number of ways.  It's a long process and anything could happen.</em></blockquote>GOP Senator <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/wire/sns-ap-land-sale,0,6404577.story?coll=sns-ap-nation-headlines">John Thune</a> of South Dakota:<blockquote><em>Funding our rural schools is very important, but it would be inappropriate to do so by selling parts of the Black Hills.  The Senate is already working on an alternative proposal that would reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools law, and I will work to pass this viable option that does not include selling off our nations public lands.</em></blockquote>Dem Senator Tim Johnson of South Dakota:<blockquote><em>This Forest Service plan results in a one-time windfall of $800 million, but does not address the long-term and structural problems facing localities with large tracts of public lands.  Our schools are in desperate need of funding, but this just seems like slapping a Band-Aid on the problem.</em></blockquote>Some local officials, too, aren't wasting time voicing their opposition to Bush's new land scheme.  From <a href="http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/mld/myrtlebeachonline/13925004.htm">South Carolina</a>:<blockquote><em>The Berkeley County Council plans to formally protest the proposed sale of more than 1,000 acres in the county by the U.S. Forest Service.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>"It's a part of our national heritage," Councilman Dennis Fish said. "There is nobody making any more land. We need to protect it."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>State Rep. David Umphlett, R-Moncks Corner, urged the County Council at a recent meeting to take action against the sale of the forest land and encouraged residents to write letters to Congress.</p>

<p>"Land is something that is hard to come by," Umphlett said. "Once you open up Pandora's box, you are not going to be able to close it."</em></blockquote>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.landusewatch.com/2006/02/20/more-on-bush-privatization-of-public-lands/">Land Use Watch</a> suggests that the Bush administration has not been truthful in its description of the land it wants to dispose of.</p>

<p>With the increasingly vocal, bipartisan, opposition, Bush's proposed land sale is so far following the <a href="../../../2005/12/gops_public_lan.html">same path</a> trod so recently by a similar ploy from GOP Representatives Richard Pombo and Jim Gibbons.  If the public pressure keeps up, even the mighty power of the executive branch may not be able to keep this plan alive.</p>

<p>But we all know that Bush does not give up easily and does not play by the normal rules.  Senator Burns may drown this idea in his own subcommittee, but keep Senator Baucus' words in mind&#151;the Bushies could find another, more pliant, GOP Senator, heading a different subcommittee.  Anything can happen.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Few specific details are yet available about exactly where the hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands that Bush wants to sell off are located.  But in South Carolina, some of it consists of forest land near one of that state's "most visible and popular natural areas", according to <a href="http://www.thestate.com/mld/thestate/13874867.htm">The State</a>&#151;land that, if sold, would quickly be developed:<blockquote><em>Tourists often drive north on S.C. 107 through the heart of the Sumter National Forest to view the fall colors, visit Oconee State Park or raft on the Chattooga River. The scenery and the accessibility of the land would make the 470 acres of Forest Service land easy to market, real estate agents said Tuesday.</p>

<p>“It would sell overnight,” said Walhalla real estate agent John Powell, who opposes the sale. But “people are not going to drive here to see condominiums or houses or subdivisions.”</em></blockquote>Many who live in that area are not pleased about the possibility of their scenic mountains turning into standard-issue exurbia:<blockquote><em>Gwen Fowler, a real estate agent whose family has lived in Oconee County for generations, said national forest land boosts the value of that private property.</p>

<p>“This is like selling an heirloom your grandmother gave to you. I’ve had calls from people all day upset about this.”</em></blockquote>Once further details of this fire sale of public lands become available, I'm afraid that there will be many similar stories coming out.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Former timber industry lobbyist, current Undersecretary of Agriculture overseeing the U.S. Forest Service, Mark Rey, looks to be the point man on President Bush's new plan to <a href="../../../2006/02/new_public_land.html">sell off public lands</a>.  The primary beneficiaries of such a sale would no doubt be real estate developers.</p>

<p>So it is quite interesting to find out that Rey appears to be beholden to at least one major real estate developer&#151;one who happens to be based right here in San Antonio:  <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_3474870">B. J. "Red" McCombs</a>.  The Denver Post reported last week:<blockquote><em>Texas billionaire B.J. "Red" McCombs, who wants the U.S. Forest Service to let him build a huge ski village atop a southwestern Colorado pass, lobbied to get the official who oversees the agency appointed, and McCombs and his allies have since met repeatedly with the official to discuss the controversial project, records and interviews show. </p>

<p>McCombs and his partner pushed to have Mark Rey, a longtime timber-industry lobbyist, appointed undersecretary of agriculture, overseeing the Forest Service.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The project is opposed by many local residents, environmentalists and even by the owners of the ski area, who have sued McCombs. </p>

<p>U.S. Rep. John Salazar, D-Colo., who represents the area in Congress, also is opposed. <br />
Michele Ames, spokeswoman for the ski-hill owners, said their position "has been all along that they've been supportive of some kind of development. The issue has become the size of the development. ... It strikes at the lifeblood of the ski hill." </p>

<p>In order to build his project, known as Village at Wolf Creek, McCombs needs Forest Service permission to build a 250-foot road across federal land so visitors can reach his property from the nearby highway.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>McCombs is a San Antonio car dealer who co-founded Clear Channel Communications, the nation's largest radio company. He's bought and sold basketball's Denver Nuggets and football's Minnesota Vikings. </p>

<p>He is a longtime donor to Republicans and a friend of the family of President Bush. He's given more than $475,000 to congressional and presidential campaigns since 1989, 91 percent of it to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. </p>

<p>McCombs and his associates have been pushing some version of the ski-village plan since the 1980s. When Bush took office in 2001, McCombs saw an opportunity to help get a friendly official placed over the Forest Service, which would decide his access- road request, records indicate. </p>

<p>According to a letter from [McCombs' main spokesman and development partner, Bob] Honts to McCombs provided by ski-area attorneys, McCombs lobbied for the appointment of Rey to the Bush administration post that controls the Forest Service. </p>

<p>McCombs tapped for help former U.S. Rep. Tom Loeffler, R-Texas, now a Texas lobbyist and a top fundraiser for Bush. </p>

<p>It's not clear whom McCombs and Loeffler approached on Rey's behalf. But after Rey was selected, Honts wrote a letter to McCombs regarding Rey's appointment. </p>

<p>"It is my understanding that your effort and former Congressman Leffler's efforts had an impact at exactly the right time in the process," said Honts' letter, which misspelled the representative's name, regarding the lobbying effort for Rey. "Obviously, the team effort worked." </p>

<p>In an interview, Honts acknowledged the lobbying campaign. He said he and McCombs backed Rey because "we were advised by people who'd been working for Village at Wolf Creek that he's a very good guy."</p>

<p>After Rey's appointment, Honts got access to him at key steps in the process of reviewing the Village at Wolf Creek proposal, according to Rey's calendars, obtained by The Post.</em></blockquote>A fascinating article that contains much, much more&#151;exposing yet another link in the culture of corruption amongst Republicans who run our federal government.</p>

<p>Right now, we can only imagine what underhanded machinations lie behind the surface of this new public lands sale, proposed by Bush, and run by friend-of-billionaire-real-estate-developers Mark Rey.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In my <a href="index.html">earlier post</a>, I said that the Bush administration's rationale for their new proposal to sell-off public lands was not worth mentioning.  But for the sake of completeness, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-bush-land-sale,1,1070898.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines">here</a> it is:<blockquote><em>Forest Service officials say the sales are needed to raise $800 million over the next five years to pay for schools and roads in rural counties hurt by logging cutbacks on federal land.</em></blockquote>Notice, however, that this money is only required because the Bushies are eliminating the current source of that money, as reported in the <a href="http://www.duluthsuperior.com/mld/duluthsuperior/news/politics/13807072.htm">Duluth News Tribune</a> a few days ago:<blockquote><em>The Bush administration proposed Monday phasing out a program that has pumped more than $2 billion into rural states hurt by logging cutbacks on federal land.</p>

<p>The plan would cut in half payments made to rural counties in 41 states and Puerto Rico for schools, roads and other infrastructure needs. The six-year-old "county payments" law has helped offset sharp declines in timber sales in western states in the wake of federal forest policy that restricts logging to protect endangered species such as the spotted owl.</p>

<p>Agriculture Undersecretary Mark Rey, who directs U.S. forest policy, called the proposal painful but necessary in a tight budget year. Rey said the 2000 law was designed to help rural counties make the transition from dependence on timber receipts to a more broad-based economy.</p>

<p>"We've had six years of it now. We're proposing another five years," he said, calling the plan "an extension of a program that was never intended to be permanent."</p>

<p>Western lawmakers said the proposal amounted to a death knell for a law that many described as the most successful federal forestry initiative in decades.</p>

<p>"Governing is about priorities, and this proposal to cut funding to rural counties by 50 percent tells rural Oregon that we're not very high on the administration's priority list," said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. "The administration found billions to fund subsidies for energy company boondoggles, so I have trouble believing they couldn't find the money to maintain support for rural counties."</em></blockquote>Former timber industry lobbyist and renowned anti-environmentalist Mark Rey claimed the previous program to fund rural schools was never intended to be permanent.  Is the sell-off of public lands intended to be permanent?</p>

<p>For more on the dismal details, see this devastating <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/editorials/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/editorial/113935832197450.xml&coll=7">editorial</a> published by the Oregonian on Wednesday:  "Swinging a budget ax at Oregon's timber towns:  The president's plan to slash county payments will injure rural communities and reignite public land conflicts."</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Scarecly a <a href="../../../2005/12/congress_public.html">few weeks</a> after a national furor resulted in the abandonment of a plan by Republican Reps. Richard Pombo of California and Jim Gibbons of Nevada to sell off public lands to private interests, now the Head GOP Honcho himself wants to do the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-bush-land-sale,1,1070898.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines">same thing</a>.<blockquote><em>The Bush administration on Friday detailed its proposal to sell more than 300,000 acres of national forests and other public land to help pay for rural schools in 41 states. </p>

<p>The land sales, ranging from less than an acre to more than 1,000 acres, could total more than $1 billion and would be the largest sale of forest land in decades.</em></blockquote>The rationale is not worth mentioning, as it is so transparently false.  The real desire is simply to start the process transferring the public's assets into the hands of friends of the GOP leadership.  Pombo and Gibbons failed, so now Bush has to step in to get the ball rolling again.<blockquote><em>"These are not the crown jewels we are talking about," [former timber industry lobbyist and current Agriculture Undersecretary Mark] Rey said in an interview.</em></blockquote>They figure as long as they don't sell the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, and Yosemite that the public won't care.  Fortunately, the reaction to the Pombo-Gibbons plan at the end of last year suggests they are wrong.<blockquote><em>BLM spokeswoman Celia Boddington said much of the land would be near urban areas with high market value. In recent years, the government has sold parcels for tens of millions of dollars in Nevada, for example, she said. </p>

<p>"Lands formerly remote are now abutting metro areas. That is certainly the case in New Mexico, Arizona and Utah," she said. </p>

<p>Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., said that is precisely the reason the land should not be sold.</p>

<p>"Our hunters, anglers, campers and other recreational users benefit from -- and depend on -- access to public lands," Bingaman said. "In my view, selling public lands to pay down the deficit would be a shortsighted, ill-advised and irresponsible shift in federal land-management policy."</em></blockquote>Bingaman's words are too understated.  Open land near population centers is exceptionally valuable the way it is, and will only get more so in the future.  Selling it off now will only benefit the real estate developers who purchase it (as well as the politicos they kick back some of the profits too), and will further impoverish the citizens of this country in future years.</p>

<p>Senator <a href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/government/article/0,2777,DRMN_23906_4457671,00.html">Bingaman</a> had other wise words, though:  "Our public lands are a legacy for future generations. We shouldn't liquidate that legacy."</p>

<p>GOP Senator Larry Craig of Idaho joined in, saying "Public lands are an asset that need to be managed and conserved," while Democratic Rep. Mark Udall of Colorado came up with an apt <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/nationworld/ci_3485264">analogy</a>, "It's like selling your homestead to pay your credit cards."</p>

<p>Senator <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/breaking_news/13844072.htm">Dianne Feinstein</a> is also on the right track, saying "California's remaining wildlands are diminishing at a rapid rate, and we need, at the very least, to keep what we have, not to sell them off to the highest bidder," and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/wire/sns-ap-bush-land-sale,1,1070898.story?coll=sns-ap-politics-headlines">adding</a> "I will do everything I can to defeat this effort."</p>

<p>Let's make sure she has some help.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The Bush administration is severely cutting the budget of our <a href="../../../2005/11/drug_cartels_in.html">already-hurting</a> National Parks Service.  <a href="http://nationalparkstraveler.typepad.com/national_parks_traveler/2006/02/president_bushs.html#more">National Parks Traveler</a> Kurt Repanshek has the details:<blockquote><em>The budget request does indeed reflect a $23.4 million increase in the Park Service's </em>operations<em> budget [as a press release from the head of the park service claims], which would go from nearly $1.72 billion to slightly more than $1.74 billion if President Bush's proposal is adopted by Congress. (Oh, and by the way, this line item calls for a cut of 139 full-time Park Service employees...)    </p>

<p>    However, the operations budget is just one component of the agency's overall appropriation, and Park Service officials acknowledge that the proposed increase would basically keep their operations budget flat.</p>

<p>    Other components range from the United States Park Police and the National Recreation and Preservation budget to Construction and Major Maintenance and Land Acquisition. Factor in all those components and there is indeed a $100 million drop in proposed 2007 funding from the current appropriation, according to the Park Service's own documentation.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Remember this promise Bush made to the American people, back when he was first running for our nation's top job in the fall of 2000?<blockquote><em>Bush picked a roaring Washington state river as the backdrop to discuss his $4.9 billion plan to improve national parks. He accused the Clinton administration of spending too many federal dollars acquiring land and not enough keeping up existing properties, leaving the National Park Service with more property but fewer resources to take care of it.</p>

<p>"The Clinton-Gore administration has chosen to expand the public ownership of land instead of tending to our parks," he said. "Their failure to make maintenance a priority has left our parks at risk and at the breaking point." </p>

<p>Bush would use the money to better maintain park roads, campgrounds and landmarks.</em></blockquote>He has clearly failed this promise.</p>
