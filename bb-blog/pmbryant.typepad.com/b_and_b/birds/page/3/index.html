                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>As I wrote about <a href="../../../2006/01/new_years_snowy.html#comment-13044452">earlier</a>, our New Years' Day Seattle-area, Skagit River delta, Hayton Reserve birding adventure gave us the opportunity to eye a rare Snowy Owl, thanks to the help of some knowledgeable local birders.  These same birders also mentioned that a Short-eared Owl had been reported a couple miles away.  After enjoying our view of the mottled black and white Snowy Owl, perched on a log a couple hundred feet away, we decided to venture down the road to see if we could luck out again and spot yet another life bird for us.</p>

<p><a href="../../../../photos/uncategorized/baldeaglespot430.jpg"><img class="image-full" alt="Baldeaglespot430" title="Baldeaglespot430" src="../../../../photos/uncategorized/baldeaglespot430.jpg" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The location was beyond the end of a road, on the edges of yet more driftwood-covered shorelines.  Arriving there, we realized the futility of trying to find the putative Short-eared Owl.  This landscape was even more confusing than the previous one.  And this owl, unlike the Snowy, would not stand out from the innumerable dead logs strewn about the coast.  Worst of all, we didn't have an army of experienced local birders with scopes to do the work for us.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we headed out, hoping to see something cool in this foreign landscape.  The idea that Bald Eagles, another potential life bird for us, were especially common in this river valley in the winter remained in the back of our minds.  </p>

<p>We walked along a linear stretch of high ground paralleling the coast of Puget Sound, several hundred feet away.  In the middle distance, small but precipitous islands rose dramatically out of the bay.  The overcast skies had turned a darker gray since we left the Snowy Owl viewpoint.  The wind persisted in gusting across the wide-open spaces, occasionally threatening to knock us off our feet.</p>

<p>Learning my lesson from our time at the Hayton Reserve, I pulled out my ski gloves from the back of the car, so as to preserve my hands for holding binoculars for a longer time.  </p>

<p>The first birds we saw were hawks of some type, several of them, but all likely the same species.  We got very good looks, from far and from close.  They had a very prominent white rump, but otherwise were generally dark.  When one made a particularly close approach, flying at about eye-level a few dozen feet in front of us, a rusty coloring on its shoulders and the underside of its wings near its body stood out.  We noticed some other field marks as well, and figured picking it out of a field guide later should be straightforward.  As usual, that wasn't the case, but now I believe these were Northern Harriers, also known as "Marsh Hawks."  The habitat certainly fit their nickname.</p>

<p>As we walked along the dike, hunters, in traditional camouflage, waded into the shallows of the bay not far away.  A couple strolled back to their cars, carrying a bloodied, dead, white Snow Goose by the neck.</p>

<p>Far in the distance, a great number of water birds were swimming or wading in the bay.  It would have been a sizeable walk to get close enough to get a decent view of these birds without a scope, and the weather was not improving.  So instead, we stopped our forward progress, and made a few cursory scans of the driftwood surrounding us hoping to get lucky and spot the Short-eared Owl.  Of course, we saw no such thing.  Or if we did, we certainly didn't notice it.  </p>

<p>We did, however, spot another raptor flying over the water, and trained our binoculars on it, expecting another one of those white-rumped hawks that were so abundant.  Immediately upon focusing, however, it was clear that this bird had a very white head and very white tail.  Any American would immediately recognize it as our national symbol, the Bald Eagle. </p>

<p>The eagle was not content to just fly around letting us get a good look at him, the first we had seen in the wild.  He had work to do.  He swooped down onto the surface of the water, quickly emerging with some kind of prey, likely a fish of some sort, that we could not quite make out.  Barely pausing, the eagle flew off in the direction from which it had come, holding its next meal in its talons.  It flew purposefully past the camouflaged hunters, not far off the ground, towards a more isolated stretch of shore that must have been a quarter-mile away from us.  There, it finally landed, presumably to commence its dinner.</p>

<p>As we lowered our binoculars to exclaim to each other at what a neat show this eagle had put on for us, a solid wall of wind blasted us from behind, practically shoving us off the raised dike.  This gust did not let up.  With it, the earlier occasional drizzle turned into heavier drops of horizontal rain that felt like ice pellets pummeling our backs.  </p>

<p>Balancing ourselves in the gale, we looked behind us and saw that the Cascade foothills had completely disappered into the deep gray of an approaching storm.  We suspended our hawk and eagle watching and high-tailed it back for our car.</p>

<p>The weather had put an abrupt end to our birding outing.  The next day we saw several more Bald Eagles before finally having to return to Texas the day after.  But nothing could match the thrill of seeing our first in the act of fishing along the shores of Puget Sound.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Over the New Years weekend, the B and B team travelled to the exotic locale&#151;by Texas standards&#151;of Seattle, Washington to visit a good friend.  For one of us, it was the first visit ever to the Pacific Northwest, and for the other (me), it was the second visit, and the first in over seventeen years.</p>

<p>Seattle in the middle of winter may not be many people's idea of a vacation destination.  Its reputation for persistent clouds and rain is definitely deserved, if our four day visit was any indication.  Yet, as we discovered via some hurried internet research before our trip, the Puget Sound region in winter is a tremendous area for watching birds.  The Skagit River valley, about an hour north of town, particularly caught our attention, especially since it appears to be a hotspot for Bald Eagles at this time of year&#151;and Bald Eagles are one of my very few 'must see' species that I had never before seen.</p>

<p>So our sightseeing agenda was set.  Birding it would be, and Skagit River valley birding if at all possible.  We fully anticipated seeing lots of brand new birds for us.  The only problem would be figuring out what they were.</p>

<p>On our first full day, we stayed close to our base in southern Snohomish County, several miles north of Seattle proper.  Taking the <a href="http://www.nwsource.com/outdoors/guides/birding_032604.html">recommendations</a> of an internet site I found the day before we left, we hit a <a href="http://www.nwsource.com/travel/scr/tf_story.cfm?st=42588">marsh</a> along the Puget Sound coast in the heart of the town of Edmonds, followed by a 300-plus-acre <a href="http://www.nwsource.com/travel/scr/tf_story.cfm?st=41074">wildlife refuge</a> along the Snohomish River a few miles inland.  </p>

<p><a href="../../../../photos/uncategorized/geeserainbowbrightness400.JPG"><img class="image-full" alt="Geeserainbowbrightness400" title="Geeserainbowbrightness400" src="../../../../photos/uncategorized/geeserainbowbrightness400.JPG" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>The next day, the first of 2006, dawned pleasant, which means it was cloudy and chilly, but not raining.  We headed out late morning and set our sights north, on the Skagit River valley.  Using the same list of recommendations, we decided to try out the <a href="http://www.nwsource.com/travel/scr/tf_story.cfm?st=42977">Hayton Reserve</a> in the Skagit Wildlife Area, in the river's delta, near the shores of Puget Sound.  Our website reference contained a brief description of the area, how to get there, and what species are typically seen, but other than that, we had little idea what to expect.</p>

<p>So it was quite dramatic for us, as we approached the location of the refuge, to see huge flocks swarming in the distance, low off the ground.  As we pulled up, we realized the flocks were even bigger than we had suspected, as most of the birds, white and off-white waterfowl, were staying on the ground.  We half expected swans of some kind, which we had not seen the previous day but had heard were prevalent, but these were clearly snow geese&#151;thousands and thousands of snow geese.  </p>

<p>We parked in the refuge's modest dirt lot and got out of the car, into a brutal, gusty, cold wind and a cacophony of cackling geese.  The hordes of birds were just across a fence in a flat, marshy expanse.  In the background, the Cascade foothills rose up into the clouds.</p>

<p><a href="../../../../photos/uncategorized/geesedarkskycontrast400.JPG"><img class="image-full" alt="Geesedarkskycontrast400" title="Geesedarkskycontrast400" src="../../../../photos/uncategorized/geesedarkskycontrast400.JPG" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a>After watching and listening to the geese's show for a few minutes, we decided to head up a small trail at the other end of the parking lot, away from the huge flock, but towards the shore.  We didn't know what was out there, but we figured we'd probably see something cool.</p>

<p>After a short distance, alongside an tiny inlet of Puget Sound, the trail ended at a fence with a "No entry beyond this point" sign.  We saw small flocks of shorebirds and some other isolated birds zipping around but were unable to even try to identify them.  We also saw a raptor flying low along the shoreline, apparently harassing more distant flocks of shorebirds, but were also not able to identify it due to a combination of our lack of raptor knowledge, bad lighting, and trying to hold binoculars steady with frozen hands in the brutal wind.  (In retrospect, based on our later raptor sightings in the area and on the single field mark I saw&#151;I think it may have been a Northern Harrier.)</p>

<p>So we resigned ourselves to enjoying the scenery with our hands in our pockets, with our attention occasionally being drawn back to the snow goose flock erupting in dramatic chatter as large numbers took flight at once.  Not far away, the sound of occasional hunter's gunfire broke through the wind.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, a pair of birders joined us at the end of the trail, spotting scope in hand.  One asked me, "Have you seen the Snowy Owl?"  All I could offer was a blank look and a confused shrug.  I didn't recall <a href="http://www.owlpages.com/owls.php?genus=Bubo&species=scandiacus">Snowy Owl</a> being on the list of birds we could expect to see, and of course had certainly not spotted one on my own.  Apparently a friend of theirs had recently seen one near this very spot.  Cool, I thought&#151;never seen one of those before.  But the thought of attempting to find it ourselves in the conditions&#151equipped with mere 8x42 binoculars and no scope&#151;did not even occur to us.  I did pull my hands out of my pockets long enough to make a few scans of the driftwood-covered landscape between us and the shore, though.  </p>

<p><a href="../../../../photos/uncategorized/birders280.JPG"><img class="image-full" alt="Birders280" title="Birders280" src="../../../../photos/uncategorized/birders280.JPG" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Soon, a couple more pairs of birders, with their own scopes, joined us.  They all commenced their search for the Snowy Owl.  Amazingly, after about ten minutes, they actually found one, hunkered down quietly on a prominent log roughly 200 feet away from us in the direction of the shoreline.  Once I knew where it was, I was surprised we hadn't all found it sooner, as its color and location did not exactly make it invisible.  But it was not moving and the jumble of debris between us and the water was a complicated visual scene.</p>

<p>One of our fellow birders was kind enough to allow us prolonged views through his high-quality scope, so we got premium views of this beautiful creature.  Its head was bright white, and it rotated it around from side to side, inspecting its environs.  The rest of it was much more mottled black and white, so this was apparently either a female or an immature owl.  During one of her looks through the scope, the other member of the B and B team noted that this owl had a fuzzy furball of some kind right next to him, apparently a dead creature waiting to be consumed.</p>

<p>As can be gathered by the attention this bird received from a group of well-equipped birders, Snowy Owls in Washington state are not an everyday occurrence.  As I have since learned, Snowy Owls are normally denizens of the Arctic tundra, where they breed far, far north of Puget Sound.  In winter, they disperse and move south, but generally not as far south as the Seattle area.  This year, for the first time in nine years, is <a href="http://www.king5.com/localnews/stories/NW_122505ENKsnowyowlsJK.135bc4af.html">different</a>.<blockquote><em>Snowy owls are being spotted throughout the region, apparently making one of their rare migrations south.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>It's uncommon for snowy owls to migrate this far south in the winter, but every few years, [raptor keeper for the Woodland Park Zoo, Gretchen] Albrecht said, the lemming population in northern Alaska dips and the raptors head south in search of food.</p>

<p>"In those years you get owls in odd places," Albrecht said. "This is pretty far south, the far end of their winter movement."</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Denver Holt, a snowy owl researcher who divides his time between Charlo, Mont., and Barrow, Alaska, said he's received reports of owl sightings this year from the Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest and Montana.</em></blockquote>So we were lucky in many ways to be able to see a Snowy Owl.  In particular, we were fortunate to run into the group of informed birders, without whom it seems extremely unlikely we would have been able to take advantage of this luck of timing and spot this majestic white fowl.</p>

<p>If you live in the northern part of this country, you too may be able to spot a <a href="http://www.ebird.org/content/news/SNOW.html">Snowy Owl</a> this winter.</p>

<p>As to whether we found any Bald Eagles or not&#151;that story will have to wait for another installment.</p>

Thanks to my recent travels, I was unable to submit anything myself.  But also thanks to my recent travels, I have plenty more fodder for future birding posts.</p>

<p>I've only had a chance to read a few of the articles so far, but have already learned about a Plover Warden's <a href="http://world.std.com/%7Ejegan/pw.html">first encounter</a> with a Loggerhead Shrike (also known as the 'butcher bird'), which came at an old haunt of mine, the Very Large Array in New Mexico.  And I've also learned a bit more about another of our local birds, the Ruby-crowned Kinglet, from <a href="https://texasnature.blogspot.com/2005/12/ruby-crowed-kinglets-are-plentiful.html">Ro Wauer</a> at Texas Nature Writers.  Wauer is a co-author of one of our prized birding reference books, <a href="http://www.longitudebooks.com/find/p/13386/mcms.html">Birding Texas</a>, and shows off his professional skills in this brief essay.</p>

                                <p>Back in November, the B and B team, along with a couple friends and fellow bird watchers, visited what is often considered to be the best birding spot in the San Antonio area:  a former wastewater treatment plant, current wildlife refuge, called <a href="http://www.tx.audubon.org/mitchell.htm">Mitchell Lake</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, with our friends' help, we were able to identify over forty-five different species of birds that afternoon.  Now I don't keep formal lists or anything resembling them, but still, this was, by far, a record for me for a single day.  The species we saw included many life birds for me, such as stunning <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Northern_Pintail_dtl.html">Northern Pintails</a>, wacky <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Hooded_Merganser.html">Hooded Mergansers</a>, and cute <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Bufflehead.html">Buffleheads</a>.  So it was quite thrilling.</p>

<p>Until a year or so ago, Mitchell Lake was run by the San Antonio Water System (SAWS) and closed to the public except for guided tours given by <a href="http://www.saaudubon.org/">San Antonio Audubon</a> volunteers on occasional Saturday mornings.  Given the long drive from our house and the early hour of the walks, we never were able to make it to one of those events.  Now, though, the <a href="http://www.saws.org/latest_news/NewsDrill.cfm?news_id=217">National Audubon Society</a> manages the place for SAWS and opens it to the public all day on Saturdays.  So last winter, our two visits were our first experience with this bird wonderland.  </p>

<p>It was on one of these visits a year ago that I experienced one of my most embarrassing birding moments.  </p>

<p>Given Mitchell Lake's obscurity with the general public, but great reputation with local birders, I suspect that roughly 100% of its visitors are more knowledgeable about birds than I am.  So I don't consider myself a good judge of what birds are especially interesting to them.  (After all, I just added the relatively common Pintails, Mergansers, and Buffleheads to my non-existent life list a month ago.)  Nonetheless, when we passed a few other people on one of the trails after spending a couple hours inspecting the place, and they asked if we had seen anything of note, I felt confident enough to offer up a response.  I don't remember my exact words, but I do remember pointing up at the graceful, <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/American_White_Pelican.html">giant white birds</a> soaring in the distance, saying, "And those penguins, of course!"</p>

<p>The quizzical look I received in response eventually got me to realize what I had said, but only after I had finished my brief discourse. We all had a good laugh at the concept of penguins flying high over the countryside south of San Antonio.  And forevermore the other half of the B and B team has teased me about this slip of the tongue.</p>

<p>For instance, that recent, popular <a href="http://wip.warnerbros.com/marchofthepenguins/">documentary</a> about the birds that march dozens of miles across the Antarctic wasteland to hatch their chicks:  that movie is known as "March of the Pelicans" around here.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>After a long, hot summer and early fall in which I had little time or energy with which to pursue many activities outside of the necessities, in the last few weeks, fall has finally begun in south central Texas.  With the belated arrival of cool air, I feel again the compelling urge to get outside and see the sensational sights that nature has to provide.  And that, of course, includes getting back to watching birds.</p>

<p>So, a few weeks ago, the B and B team travelled three hours down the road to the central Texas coast, to the <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/features/3408023.html">Rockport-Fulton</a> area, a renowned <a href="http://www.grandtimes.com/rockport.html">birding hotspot</a> north of Corpus Christi.  The quality and ease of bird watching there are indeed impressive, even for relative novices like ourselves.  Our only previous trip to that area, four years ago, had been the inspiration for us to purchase ourselves a nice pair of binoculars at long last.  It pushed us over the edge to being committed, if part-time, birders.</p>

<p>This time, alas, we did not have much time to spend&#151;it was a mere overnight trip.  But, by luck and circumstance, we found, and were able to splurge on, a very special place to stay.  A place that was to give us the opportunity to view whooping cranes for the first time&#151;and not just any viewing opportunity, but an up-close and personal one.</p>

<p>For those who may not be familiar with them, <a href="http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/whoopingcrane/">whooping cranes</a> are very tall, very endangered birds.  Fifty years ago there were less than two dozen of them left in the wild, all in a single flock that migrated from Wood Buffalo National Park in the wilds of northwestern Canada to a small peninsula on the central Texas coast northeast of Rockport&#151an area that had been preserved in the 1930s as the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/southwest/refuges/texas/aransas.html">Aransas National Wildlife Refuge</a>. Fortunately, thanks to the long, hard work of <a href="http://www.whoopingcrane.com/">many</a>, whooping cranes are recovering well&#151there are now over 200 cranes in the Aransas flock.  Unfortunately, the Aransas flock is still the only established flock, so the birds remain vulnerable to a single catastrophic event.  To guard against this, wildlife biologists and others are experimenting with establishing <a href="http://www.bringbackthecranes.org/">additional</a> flocks: one non-migratory one in central Florida and one migratory one between Wisconsin and Florida.</p>

<p>The vacation house we rented for that night is located on a ranch near some coastal wetlands, a portion of which the owners had recently donated to the Nature Conservancy.  The ranch is across a narrow inlet from the peninsula where the vast majority of the Aransas Refuge is located and where the wild flock of whooping cranes spend their winters, each family occupying roughly a square mile.  A family of whooping cranes had shown up virtually on the front door of this house in past winters, to eat the corn that had originally been put out to feed white-tailed deer.</p>

<p>Having never seen a <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Whooping_Crane.html">whooping crane</a>&#151;for that matter, having never seen any other type of crane before&#151;we didn't know what to expect.  Would they be immediately obvious or not?  Our previous visit to Aransas had been in early October&#151too early to see whoopers.  Now, we were visiting in mid-November, when about half the cranes would have arrived at their wintering grounds, but half would still be in transit.  With great timing for us, the pair of cranes that claim the territory around this house showed up two days before our trip.</p>

<p>Our arrival was only a couple hours past, when, as we were returning to the house from a short excursion to spot ducks and other water birds along the coastal wetlands, we saw two huge white birds, with black wing tips, swooping in for a landing on the road, just fifty feet or so in front of the house.  No field guides were needed for this identification!  Alas, the cranes were quicker than us, for we had not yet put out the deer corn as the proprietor had suggested.  So the whoopers promptly took off again and headed the short distance back towards the bay.</p>

<p>Taking our cue, we spread a bucket of the corn along the road, then went out again to look for birds in the coastal marshes, identifying several species that we had never before (such as <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Sandhill_Crane.html">sandhill cranes</a>, <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Green-winged_Teal.html">green-winged teals</a>, and <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Pied-billed_Grebe.html">pied-billed grebes</a>) as well as numerous old favorites (such as <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Great_Egret.html#map">great egrets</a>, <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Little_Blue_Heron.html">little blue herons</a>, and some "Mexican eagles", <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/programs/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Crested_Caracara.html">crested caracaras</a>).  We even found the pair of whooping cranes, one of which was masking its height by sitting down in a dry, bare spot amidst the grasses&#151;perhaps resting from its recent journey from northern Canada.</p>

<p>While we were out, we noticed the whoopers fly low towards the house at least two more times, but not landing either time&#151;instead circling around and then heading back towards where they had been resting earlier.  When we returned to the house, we realized why&#151;the two horses living on the ranch were in the road taking their fill of the deer corn.</p>

<p>Eventually, the horses moved on, and a herd of deer and a family of three sandhill cranes&#151two adults and one juvenile&#151;decided to take over the feeding spot.  We settled down in the screened-in porch, a few dozen feet away, to watch.  Sandhill cranes were a new species for us as well.  They are duskier-colored and shorter than whoopers, though not exactly small themselves.</p>

<p>Before long, the whoopers swooped in again, with their long wingspans dwarfing the small shrubs near the road and attracting the attention of the feeding deer and sandhills.  They landed and started moving in towards the feeding area, walking slowly but steadily along the road.  As they did, the sandhill cranes retreated, as did most of the deer.  The few deer who stubbornly continued feeding soon found themselves being charged, pecked at, and honked at repeatedly by two very large, very loud birds.  Needless to say, these stubborn deer didn't stick around for long.</p>

<p>And so we watched quietly for the next hour from inside our comfortable blind, as the two whoopers took turns eating and keeping lookout, trumpeting loudly with their namesake "whoops" whenever any impatient deer tried to sneak back onto the road. </p>

<p>As the sun neared the horizon behind us, the whoopers suddenly faced east together, gracefully lofted themselves into the air, and headed towards the marshes.  The three sandhill cranes, who had been waiting patiently a distance away, moved back in to eat.  They stayed until well after sunset, kept up late by their deference to their larger cousins.  And then they, too, flew off quietly into the approaching night.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>In central Texas, we have at least two bird species that are officially endangered&#151;the Golden-cheeked Warbler and the Black-capped Vireo.  Both suffer from habitat loss of their preferred breeding grounds.  But another factor that commonly believed to harm their populations is the prevalence of cowbirds.  </p>

<p>From the <a href="http://audubon2.org/webapp/watchlist/viewSpecies.jsp?id=31">Audubon Society</a>:<blockquote><em>The Brown-headed Cowbird, a species which lays its eggs in the nests of vireos and other birds so that they are "tricked" into raising the young cowbirds instead of their own young, has thrived on human activities such as bird feeding and agriculture and as a result can cause widespread reproductive failure in Black-capped Vireo populations.</em></blockquote><br />
So to help save the Golden-cheeked Warbler and Black-capped Vireo from extinction, conservation organizations use, in addition to habitat preservation and restoration, cowbird "control" programs (i.e., trapping and euthanizing), with significant <a href="http://audubon2.org/webapp/watchlist/viewSpecies.jsp?id=31">apparent success</a>.<br />
<blockquote><em>A diverse coalition of agencies and organizations including Audubon Texas is working together on a cowbird trapping initiative aimed at decreasing parasitism rates on Black-capped Vireos and Golden-cheeked Warblers. A population of Black-capped Vireos at Fort Hood Military Reservation, Texas showed a dramatic increase in nest productivity after an intensive cowbird trapping program.</em></blockquote>A <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/01/0131_030131_vireo.html">National Geographic</a> news item from 2003 provides a few more details:<blockquote><em>Controlling the population of cowbirds is critical in this struggle [to save the Black-capped Vireo]. After a cowbird trapping program had been implemented at Fort Hood, Texas, and on nearby ranches, the vireos' low 5 percent reproductive success rate of 1987 leaped to 45.5 percent in 1996. Trapping is an expensive, short-term solution, though, that mostly helps local populations.</em></blockquote></p>

<p>(For even more details on the Ford Hood program, see this <a href="http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1515/febmar2001/songbird.htm">link</a>.)</p>

<p>Now, though, as I hear via the ecologist, Nuthatch, at her excellent blog, <a href="http://nuthatch.typepad.com/ba/2005/11/are_kirtlands_w.html">Boostrap Analysis</a>, it appears as though the cowbird control programs may be getting a budget cut from the feds, and some members of the birding community are concerned about negative repercussions on endangered songbirds, such as the Kirtland's Warbler, which breeds in Michigan.  (Since the cuts are federal, I guess that they would also impact anti-cowbird programs for the Black-capped Vireo and Golden-cheeked Warbler in Texas.)</p>

<p>Nuthatch is not so concerned, however, and is promising a "devil's advocate" argument, to be presented in a series of upcoming posts.<blockquote><em>We tend to lose sight of the fact that nest parasitism is a natural process. Would any sensible conservationist endorse the slaughter of hawks, even though doing so would undoubtedly save the lives of any number of birds or small animals? </p>

<p>There is more than meets the eye here, and in a series of several posts, I’d like to briefly explore three main topics: the truth about cowbirds and their impacts on songbirds, problems with cowbird control as an endangered species management tool, and the specific issues surrounding Kirtland’s Warbler recovery efforts. Stay tuned, I'm sure my "devil's advocate" position may ruffle some feathers.<br />
</em></blockquote>Judging from some of the comments to her post, she's already ruffled some feathers.  But given all that I've learned about birds from Nuthatch in the past, I'll definitely be listening.</p>
