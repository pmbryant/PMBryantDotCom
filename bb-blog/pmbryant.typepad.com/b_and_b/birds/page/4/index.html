		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p><a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm"><img class="image-full" alt="Iandthebirdlogoolive_1" title="Iandthebirdlogoolive_1" src="../../../../photos/uncategorized/iandthebirdlogoolive_1.jpg" border="0" style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a>Welcome to the third edition of the blog carnival for bird lovers, <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm">I and the Bird.</a>  It is a great honor for me to host this, especially since, while I am indeed a bird lover, I am not a particularly skillful bird watcher.  But I enjoy birds greatly.  Yes, even those I do not know exactly what they may be called because they don't seem to match up with anything in my field guide.  And even those that I can't get a decent look at because they're flitting about in that dense brush so close, yet so far.  Finally, after many years at it, I think I have a good understanding of which species birds live in and around our backyard and even know a fair amount of their behavior.  It's been a slow process.  </p>

<p>Take me far out of this immediate area, however, and I am back to being a beginner.  Of course, the great thing about that is that there's always new birds to see, and new bird behavior to learn.  </p>

<p>In addition to watching birds, I also enjoy reading about the experiences of other bird lovers, from those who are occasional indulgers in birding like myself, to those who are expert amateurs, to those who are professionals.  The previous editions of "I and the Bird" have been a great way to discover such writings.  The submissions for this new edition follow in the excellent, if short, tradition of the first two.</p>

<p>This birding carnival, in the way that I am comfortable with, starts out very close to home.  <br />
<ul><li>Aydin Örstan at <a href="https://snailstales.blogspot.com/">Snail's Tales</a> writes about how he used a couple common backyard birds who showed up on his deck to benchmark his hearing, in '<a href="https://snailstales.blogspot.com/2005/06/cardinals-at-limit-of-my-hearing.html">The Cardinals at the limit of my hearing</a>.'</li><br />
<li>Nuthatch at <a href="http://nuthatch.typepad.com/ba/">bootstrap analysis</a>, expounds upon the habits of a small, gregarious bird that accompanies her in the garden throughout the summer in '<a href="http://nuthatch.typepad.com/ba/2005/07/an_exuberant_bi.html">an exuberant bird in a plain brown wrapper</a>.'</li><br />
<li>Yours truly wrote about my experience last year at finally, and unexpectedly, sighting an <a href="../../../2005/08/elusive_bird.html">elusive bird</a> whose nighttime call has been a comforting presence every spring for the last six years.</li><br />
<li>Clare Kines at <a href="http://kiggavik.typepad.com/the_house_other_arctic_mu/">The House & other Arctic musings</a> tells us about the different types of seagulls that inhabit his part of the world.  Read '<a href="http://kiggavik.typepad.com/the_house_other_arctic_mu/2005/07/gulls.html">Gulls</a>', so that next time you spot a seagull, you can say, "Look!  A glaucous gull."</li><br />
<li>Mike at <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/">10,000 Birds</a> reports on a birding excursion away from home, but in a part of the world he visits regularly in order to burn a giant chicken.  Or something like that.  Read '<a href="http://www.10000birds.com/july2005.htm#7/27/05">Birds Of Chicken Inferno 2005</a> for a full explanation&#151and also to see a picture of the "gigantic galliform" itself.</li></ul>Moving on, the carnival travels into the domain of surveys.  I have some experience with this, having participated in a few bird surveys myself, as well as the Great Backyard Bird Count.<ul><li>Unlike Duncan at <a href="http://dcfraser.customer.netspace.net.au/blogger.htm">Ben Cruachan Blog</a>, however, I do not have experience with parrots.  (Except for that recent charming movie about the guy in San Francisco.)  Duncan writes about his parrot (and other bird) counting experience along the southern coast of Australia in '<a href="http://dcfraser.customer.netspace.net.au/2005/07/parrot-arithmetic.html">Parrot arithmetic</a>.'</li><br />
<li>Tony G at <a href="https://milkriver.blogspot.com/">milkriverblog</a>, just up the road here in central Texas, reports on the results of a recent, and rather unique, survey of his own in <a href="https://milkriver.blogspot.com/2005/05/env-wakeup-calls.html">Wakeup Calls</a>.</li></ul>Next, the carnival moves into the quest for rarities, a popular pursuit amongst many birders, but one I have yet to try out myself.<ul><li>John at <a href="https://dendroica.blogspot.com/">A DC Birding Blog</a> sets out on a local expedition to spot two reported species not normally found in his environs this time of year.  To find out what he was looking for and whether he found it, read '<a href="https://dendroica.blogspot.com/2005/07/sultry-evening-twitch-report-on.html">A Sultry Evening Twitch</a>.'</li><br />
<li>A British blogger at <a href="https://bogbumper.blogspot.com/">bogbumper</a> reports on a couple of rare, spectacular birds in Britain that attracted quite a crowd before an unfortunate ending.  For details, read '<a href="https://bogbumper.blogspot.com/2005/07/day-bee-eaters-got-eaten.html">The day the Bee-eaters got eaten</a>.'</li></ul>What would a bird carnival excursion be without the chance to see a hawk eat a meal?  (Not the bee-eaters, fortunately!)  Today we have double the fun.<ul><li>First, the illustrated version, including action shots, from Rexroth's Daughter at <a href="https://newdharmabums.blogspot.com/">Dharma Bums</a>, who has a whole sequence of pictures in her post '<a href="https://newdharmabums.blogspot.com/2005/07/hawk-gets-lunch.html">A Hawk Gets Lunch</a>.'</li><br />
<li>Next, the narrated version from Birdchick at <a href="http://www.birdchick.com/blog.html">Birdchick Blog</a>.  As she describes in <a href="http://www.birdchick.com/2005/07/first-blood-at-bird-store.html">First Blood at the Bird Store</a>, this particular hawk may have been a novice at his work.</li></ul>After that lunch break, it's time to get up-close and personal with the next group of birds.<ul><li>Dave at the <a href="https://birdtlc.blogspot.com/">Bird Treatment and Learning Center</a> in Anchorage, Alaska relates the story of a hero of a bird in '<a href="https://birdtlc.blogspot.com/2005/08/quality-time-with-one-wing-ol-witch.html">Quality Time with One Wing & Ol' Witch</a>'.  It is about his encounter with an eagle whose will to live not only helped him survive devastating injuries suffered in the infamous Exxon Valdez oil spill, but also helped save the lives of numerous other eagles also injured in the spill.</li><br />
<li>Jason at <a href="http://www.beakspeak.com/">Beakspeak</a> treats us with some spectacular shots of hummingbird babies growing up in his posts <a href="http://www.beakspeak.com/archive/2005/06/13/the_humm.shtml">The Hummingbird Chronicles</a> and <a href="http://www.beakspeak.com/archive/2005/06/21/the_humm.shtml">The Hummingbird Chronicles: An Update</a>.  He even got a short video of one as it was on the verge of learning to fly.  Don't miss it!</li></ul>Finally, we get to explore the more personal side of birding.<ul><li>Charlie Moores at <a href="http://www.charliesbirdblog.com/">Charlie's Bird Blog</a> explores the question of why he devotes much of his scarce spare time to watching these small, flying creatures in a post entitled 'How in a rambling conversation I get to see why I go birding'.  (There is no link directly to the post, so if you encounter this at some future date, go to his blog and either scroll down or look in his archives.)</li></ul>And so the third edition of '<a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm">I and the Bird</a>,' with all its multi-media glory, comes to a close.  Yet the fourth edition, which will be hosted at <a href="https://milkriver.blogspot.com/">milkriverblog</a>, is only two weeks away.  Please send your submissions to either <a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3aeaaa8a683f2f3f3f3f3a1aab1a7b0eda0acae">Mike</a> at 10,000 Birds or <a href="https://pmbryant.typepad.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a9c1dcdbdbc0cac8c7ccddcee9c1c6ddc4c8c0c587cac6c4">Tony G</a> at milkriverblog on or before Tuesday, August 16.  I am looking forward to the next edition already!<br />

		<a href="../../../2005/08/elusive_bird.html">A loud, elusive, comforting bird</a></h3>
		



		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Every spring, each day as the sun drops below the horizon, the call starts.  A low, soft, clicking sound, rapidly followed by a loud multi-pitched, three-part whistle.  It is unmistakeable.  It is the sign of the chuck-wills-widow&#151the odd name of the bird derived from its distinctive call.  </p>

<p>We've heard that bird&#151sometimes more than one&#151for several months every night of every spring in each of the six springs we have lived in our current house.  As the sky gets dark, the call starts out, seemingly tentative, at relatively low volume and infrequent intervals.  As darkness creeps in, the call gets more insistent, growing louder, repeating every few seconds.  Someone clearly wants to be heard.  And this goes on for hours.  Occasionally I would emerge outside in the middle of the night only to hear the bird still repeating that call endlessly.  As the Texas summer approaches, the call comes less frequently until at some point it ceases.  I do not know exactly when that is, as in the Texas summer, we are not out in the backyard so often.  After all, it's kind of hot here then.</p>

<p>Despite all this commotion over all these years, I have never seen the bird.  I know from field guides that it is not a small creature, as it is larger than the scrub jays that frequent our yard during the daytime, occasionally scaring off the smaller songbirds.  But the chuck-wills-widow is exquisitely camouflaged.  During the daytime, you would practically have to step on one to see it, I suspect.  And at night, when it is active, well, it's dark.</p>

<p>Ok, it's not quite true that I have never seen the bird.  I did see it once, albeit not well.  In the spring, a year ago.  </p>

<p>A couple years earlier I had gotten curious one night and tried to fight through the cedar-covered lots surrounding our house to find out approximately where this bird lived.  But after pushing through a few dozen feet, I realized the call wasn't getting appreciably louder.  Clearly, this bird, which sounded so close, was not quite as close as I thought.  So I gave up, not too disappointed since I found its constant presence comforting and didn't want to disturb it.</p>

<p>But then that day a bit over year ago, the call was literally booming in my ears one night.  The sun had set perhaps 45 minutes earlier, but there was still a small amount of light in the sky.  After deafening me for a short while, the call would stop for a minute, then resume booming in my ears, but from a bit further to the right.   Now, he <i>really</i> had to be close.  It just couldn't sound this loud and not be within a few dozen feet.  Or could it?  It had already fooled me once.  So I decided to try to find out, by inching around the yard extremely slowly.  </p>

<p>I had no hope of seeing anything.  There was barely any light left.  I merely hoped to triangulate the sound to estimate where the bird was located.  Even this would be difficult, though, since, unusually, the sound of the call was moving around frequently&#151every minute or two.  For several minutes I inched around, changed directions to follow the sound, inched around some more, and so on.  Then, with the bird temporarily silent, I emerged into a clearing at the edge of a small dirt road about 100 feet behind our house.  Then the call started again.  Louder than ever.  So ear-splittingly loud that I knew it had to be directly across the road from me, barely 10 feet away.  </p>

<p>I froze.  Finally, I believed I knew where the bird was, even if I couldn't see it.  For the first time in four years of listening to that chuck-wills-widow, I could say that.  And I must say, the volume of that bird's call was extremely impressive.  I had never fully appreciated that before.  </p>

<p>But my luck was about to get even better, for after a minute or so, as was its pattern that day, the bird decided to spare my ears and move further away.  When it did so, as it took off, it emerged into a 3-foot wide trail cut through the dense cedar and I saw the bird's silhouette against the sky ever so briefly before it disappeared into the darkness.</p>

<p>I had not expected to ever see that bird.  But it had briefly revealed itself to me.  And I was thrilled.</p>

                                <p>The second edition of the blog carnival for birders, <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm">I and the Bird</a>, is out&#151published at <a href="http://www.charliesbirdblog.com/">Charlie's Bird Blog</a> this week.</p>

<p>Take a trip over there to learn, among other things, about those hard-to-figure-out <a href="https://thomasburg-walks.blogspot.com/2005/06/little-brown-birds-part-2.html">little brown birds</a> called sparrows from Pamela Martin in Thomasburg, Ontario.  And also about the slow-but-sure recovery of the <a href="http://www.beakspeak.com/archive/2005/06/27/flight_o.shtml">California condor</a> from Jason at Beakspeak.</p>

<p>My own experience with sparrows is probably typical of <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/july2005.htm#7/6/05">(bad)</a> birdwatchers.  I'm good at picking out Chipping Sparrows, since they swarm our backyard feeders in the winter, but everything else is a blur.  Except for Lark Sparrows, of course, but they are special, and I don't get to see them very frequently.  (And never in my backyard, alas.)</p>

<p>As for condors, I've never seen one.  Back when I lived in southern California, the recovery program was just starting to re-release them into the wild.  And I was totally ignorant of birds at the time.  But I have been following their recovery ever since that time, and hope to get a chance to see one the next time I'm out West.  That may be a while, unfortunately.</p>

<p>What is definite, though, is that this blog has the honor of hosting the third edition of <a href="http://www.10000birds.com/iandthebird.htm">I and the Bird</a> in two weeks.

<blockquote><em></em>I and the Bird<em> is a carnival celebrating the interaction of human and avian, an ongoing exploration of the endless fascination with birdlife all around the world. It is also a biweekly showcase of the best bird writing on the web published on alternating Thursdays.</em></blockquote>

<p>I submitted an old post on our experience with the <a href="../../../2005/02/adventures_in_b.html">Great Backyard Bird Count</a> back in February, and plan on participating further, although I appear to be quite an amateur compared to many of the other participants.</p>

<p>One interesting post in this carnival is from Clare Kines of Nunavut, Canada, up in the vicinity of the Arctic circle, who writes a blog called "The House & other Arctic musings."  His post is about a bird known up there as the <a href="http://kiggavik.typepad.com/the_house_other_arctic_mu/2005/07/qarsauq.html">Qarsaug</a>.  Pronouced down here as "Red-throated loon."</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>I read a story that should be of interest to birders and others interested in nature in the <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA061805.1B.bird_relocation.1d6d1f62.html">San Antonio Express-News</a> over the weekend.&nbsp; Swallows have artfully adapted to using human structures on which to build their homes.&nbsp; But what happens when the humans decide that a particular structure, still useful to the swallows, has outlived its usefulness to the humans?</p><blockquote><p><em>
As their parents zoomed about in apparent confusion and distress, almost 100 young cave swallows and eggs were removed from a doomed highway overpass and resettled by wildlife specialists on Friday.
</em></p>

<p>
<em> Many of the baby birds had just hatched. They seemed to be all mouth atop tiny, pink fuzzy bodies. Others were fully feathered and looked ready to leave their nests. The white and speckled eggs were only a little larger than jelly beans.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Wildlife specialists placed the offspring in shoeboxes and drove them to a nearby highway bridge where they were inserted into the nests of other cave swallows, which took to them as if they were their own. Four of the fledglings opted to fly off rather than be raised by foster parents.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>...
</em></p>

<p>
<em> The rush to demolish the westbound and eastbound lanes of Loop 410 where it rises over South Zarzamora Street ruffled a few feathers.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Lynn Cuny, executive director of Wildlife Rescue &amp; Rehabilitation, a nonprofit wildlife rescue agency out of Kendalia that led the relocation effort, questioned the state's decision to evict the birds rather than hold off for a few weeks.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;We tried to get the project to wait until the birds moved themselves,&quot; she said. &quot;This is going to be a real sad day for these birds because they're losing their families.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Cuny said her group was the only one in the region authorized to handle federally protected migratory birds and has never before been asked by the state to move any.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;It's scary to think how many times this has happened where the bridges went down with the babies in the nest,&quot; she said.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Angela Grimes, the wildlife rescue agency's operations director, said the toughest part was watching one pair of swallow parents perch right where their nest had been.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Grimes imagined what must have been running through their minds: &quot;'They were just here. Where are my babies?' That's what is so wrong about this.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>The rescue group doesn't expect the baby birds to be reunited with their parents. 
</em></p></blockquote><p>For fellow bird lovers, it seems distressing that this would be done at a time when the swallows are raising their young, but I get that impression that for any consideration at all to be given to birds during overpass work of this sort is new.&nbsp; And for this new concern, we can apparently thank Valerie Collins, a wildlife biologist hired by the Texas Department of Transportation.</p>

<p></p><blockquote><p><em>
Collins said she took a lot of guff from colleagues and others over her insistence that no swallows be killed.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;I'm a laughingstock,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm the bird lady.&quot;
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Collins said that whenever an overpass is set for destruction, netting or a special kind of barbed wire should be put up to force the swallows, which habitually return to the same nesting site each year, to build their little nests of mud elsewhere.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>Collins said she hopes state employees and others learned a lesson.
</em></p>

<p>
<em>&quot;If this is a big pain, then maybe they'll do it right next time,&quot; she said. </em></p></blockquote>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Some good news for the weekend.&nbsp; In California's central valley, an <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/wire/sns-ap-songbirds-return,1,5527407.story?coll=sns-ap-science-headlines">endangered songbird</a> is making a comeback and showing up in places it hasn't been seen in decades, thanks to efforts at land restoration:</p><blockquote><p><em>FRESNO, Calif. -- A chatty songbird thought to have disappeared from
the Central Valley 60 years ago has been spotted nesting in a patch of
restored habitat along the San Joaquin River. <br /><br />The
least Bell's vireo, a little gray songbird that fits in a closed fist,
was once widespread in the Central Valley. It disappeared from the area
as the riparian habitat it favors was ripped up to make way for
development and agriculture. About 90 percent of the valley's historic
riverside vegetation has been lost, said Al Donner, spokesman for the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<br /><br />The bird was put on the federal endangered species list in 1986, when
there were only about 300 pairs left in the low-lying shrubbery along
creeks and streams in southern California.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Dropping her equipment, [seasonal biologist for the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge, Linette] Lina focused her binoculars on the bird -- a
male perched on a branch about 30 feet away, singing and shaking his
tail feathers. As she called her supervisor about the discovery, a
female joined him and did a copulation dance. <br /><br />Further
investigation showed the nesting pair was feeding two baby birds, which
were just learning to fly, said Lina, who does bird counts and
observation for the Point Reyes Bird Observatory Conservation Science.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The area where they were found had been a ranch, which was bought in
1998 and restored over the last three years by Fish and Wildlife with
help from the state of California.</em></p></blockquote><p>It must be immensely satisfying for these biologists to see the fruits of the efforts of years of hard restoration work.</p>

<p>A blog called <a href="http://www.faultline.org/place/toad/archive/2005_06.html">Toad in the Hole</a> has an email from a couple days ago from
within the federal Fish &amp; Wildlife Service announcing this
discovery.&nbsp; Also, <a href="https://girlscientist.blogspot.com/">Hedwig</a> has a pointer to this story in her current edition of <a href="https://girlscientist.blogspot.com/2005/06/birds-in-news-15.html">Birds in the News</a>. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.umich.edu/~esupdate/library/97.07-08/contents.html"><img width="100" height="63" border="0" src="../../../images/leastbellsvireoumich_1.jpg" title="Leastbellsvireoumich_1" alt="Leastbellsvireoumich_1" style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px; float: right;" /></a>As a result of the destruction of much of their riparian habitat over the latter half of the twentieth century, least Bell's vireos had been confined to <a href="http://www.werc.usgs.gov/sandiego/flycat.html">southern California</a>—in particular the Camp Pendleton area in San Diego County.&nbsp; Habitat loss and also nest-parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds reduced the vireos numbers into the hundreds by the mid-1980s.</p>

<p>Fortunately, efforts to <a href="https://pacific.fws.gov/news/1998/9850nr.htm">control cowbirds</a> and preserve and restore habitat have increased the numbers of least Bell's vireos to <a href="http://www.nctimes.com/articles/2005/02/28/special_reports/science_technology/10_12_222_26_05.txt">around 3000</a> these days.&nbsp; And with that increase, they have been expanding back north into their former range.&nbsp; So perhaps this exciting discovery in the central valley should not be all that surprising.</p>

<p>For those who aren't familiar with cowbirds, here is a description of their <a href="http://www.audubon.org/bird/research/">parasitic behavior</a> from the Audubon Society:</p><blockquote><p><em>Instead of building their own nests, incubating their own eggs and
raising their own nestlings, Brown-headed Cowbirds have a different
breeding strategy. Cowbird females use other bird species as hosts --
laying their eggs in the nests of other bird species and relying on
these hosts to incubate and raise their chicks.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Brown-headed Cowbirds occupy most of North America south of the Arctic,
but this large range has occurred only recently and is the result of
human-induced factors. Prior to the arrival of Europeans in North
America, cowbirds were nomadic, following the large herds of bison that
roamed across the Great Plains.</em></p></blockquote><p>When their nests are parasitized, tiny vireos and other songbird parents end up feeding chicks bigger than they are.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, cowbirds are a major problem for far more bird species than just the least Bell's vireo.&nbsp; For instance, here in central Texas, they are a major reason why the black-capped vireo is an endangered species.</p>

<p>But for today at least, we can celebrate the least Bell's vireo return to its old home in California's central valley.</p>

<p>The small white bar at bottom left represents a scale of 2 km.&nbsp; The caption reads, in part:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>In this image from NASA’s Landsat 7 satellite, acquired on December 23, 2001, the dense vegetation of swampy bottomland forests, sloughs, oxbow river bends, and bayous in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge makes a dramatic contrast to the geometric checkerboard of farmlands. Ground that is bare or sparsely vegetated appears pinkish tan. The dense (but leafless in winter) vegetation of the refuge’s tupelo and cypress forests appears dark gray. When you look carefully (particularly in the high-resolution image), the forests are interwoven with swampy areas that appear lighter gray. A large swath of this gray swampy area runs through the narrow strip of the refuge that follows the Deview Bayou northeast of the large protected area near image center. Interstate 40 cuts diagonally across the southern part of this large tract of land.</em></p></blockquote><p>Images like this emphasize how amazing the re-discovery of the ivory-billed woodpecker is.&nbsp; Given the huge areas it needs to survive, how could it have possibly survived for over six decades in places like this?&nbsp; Hopefully we will learn answers to this and other questions in the coming years, and that the answers will help us to ensure that the ivory-bills, and other species, continue to survive.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The day after the amazing announcement that the <a href="../../../2005/04/ivorybilled_woo.html">ivory-billed woodpecker</a> is not extinct after all, some skeptics have emerged. </p>

<p>Nick Matzke, at <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org/pt-archives/000986.html">The Panda's Thumb</a>, despite an admitted lack of expertise, worries that the bird seen may not actually be an ivory-bill.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><em>... I’ve got a bad feeling that hopes are going to be dashed again.&nbsp; What
they’ve put up in terms of data is scans of field notes and a detailed
analysis of one very short video that is being interpreted right at the
limits of its resolution.</em></p></blockquote> <p>As I mentioned yesterday, my initial reaction also was disbelief, but when I read how confident the experts are about this, how they spent over a year working on confirmation, I became convinced.&nbsp; Then I read the paper, watched the video, and remained convinced.&nbsp; Matzke's concern about the video is unfounded, in my opinion.&nbsp; Perhaps my confidence in the analysis of the video is a remnant of my background in astronomy.&nbsp; I am very used to the process of teasing significant amounts of information out of noisy, low-resolution data.&nbsp; By comparison with much of what astronomers frequently work with, the woodpecker video is extremely detailed.&nbsp; And, of course, the video is just the icing on the cake of the numerous sightings by expert ornithologists.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.corante.com/loom/archives/2005/04/28/reports_of_my_extinction_are_greatly_exaggerated.php">Carl Zimmer</a>, seconded by <a href="http://www.chriscmooney.com/blog.asp?Id=1764">Chris Mooney</a>, cautions that just because some ivory-bills may still live, much ecological devastation has already occurred, both in the U.S. and around the world, and numerous other species may be doomed. Of course this isn't exactly news and so should do nothing to allay the joy that at least one species thought extinct may still have a chance at survival.&nbsp; If a few ivory-bills could survive on their own for decades with no special protections for its habitat, the species should have a decent chance for longer-term survival now that such special protections will be put in place.</p>

<p>Finally, PZ Myers at <a title="Pharyngula::Woodpecker woes" href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/woodpecker_woes/">Pharyngula</a> lets his cynical side
come to the forefront:</p><blockquote><p><em>Call me a cynic, but my first thought was that one bird does not a
species make, and that I don't find cause to celebrate in the fact that
we made it to the wreckage in time to catch the last gasps of a
magnificent animal. &quot;We killed them all…</em><em>but one!&quot; is not an inspiring rallying cry for environmentalists.</em></p></blockquote><p>Fortunately, Myers' imagined rallying cry is almost certainly not true.&nbsp; Hedwig at Living the Scientific Life <a href="https://girlscientist.blogspot.com/2005/04/another-email-from-search-participant.html">publishes</a> an email distributed by Scott Weidensaul, a nature writer who was a participant in the search party in Arkansas.&nbsp; He writes (emphasis added):</p><blockquote><p><em>The sightings were all of a single bird, always a male (though there
was one undocumented sighting of a possible female). It appears the
search team was not operating near the bird's normal home range, since
the sightings averaged only about one per month; this is a huge area,
and there's lots of room for even a duck-sized woodpecker to disappear.
<strong>No one thinks it likely that this bird is the very last of its kind, so
it's likely there are more out there in the huge Big Woods region, or
in other bottomland forests along the Mississippi Delta</strong>.<br /><br />Interestingly,
in contrast to the noisy, fairly tame behavior Jim Tanner recorded for
the species in Louisiana in the 1930s, this bird has proven incredibly
shy and wary, always vanishing at the first hint of a human. Many
people -- and I include myself in this -- had long assumed that if
ivorybills survived in the U.S., someone would have found and
documented them decades ago. The fact that so many people, backed up
with technology like automated recording devices and cameras, had such
a hard time getting documentation in the Big Woods, suggests we've been
underestimating the difficulty of finding this species. The &quot;intensive&quot;
Pearl River search [in 2002], for example, involved six people for 30 days; most
times that a sighting has been followed up, it's been someone in a
canoe poking around for a day or two at most. <strong>One lesson from the Big
Woods is that we cannot easily dismiss any of the reports elsewhere in
the species' historic range, especially those in South Carolina and
Florida which have been persistent for many years. </strong>I know scientists
are following up on some of those reports even as the news is trumpeted
from Arkansas. Let's all keep our fingers crossed.<br /><br />This is one
of the most hopeful stories I've ever had the privilege to report on,
and it comes at a time when conservationists need some good news. It
