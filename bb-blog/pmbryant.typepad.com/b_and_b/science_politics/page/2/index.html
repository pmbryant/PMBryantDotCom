		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Many science bloggers, led by famous radical militant biologist P.Z. Myers of <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a>, have been vigilant in keeping a close eye on the movement to force public schools in this country to teach Intelligent Design (aka, "ID") as a valid scientific alternative to evolutionary theory.  </p>

<p>A few days ago, Myers was particularly impressed with an op-ed written by <a href="http://www.statesman.com/opinion/content/editorial/stories/02/2dee_edit.html">James Dee</a> of Austin, published in the Austin American-Statesman, in which Dee attempts to dismantle the logic behind the ID-as-science concept.</p>

<p>What caught my attention, though, was the way Myers <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/02/texas_isnt_all_bad.php">presented</a> this article&#151;with the title "Texas isn't all bad" and the opening line "There's always Austin."  This, of course, prompted many defenses of this state, including one from me where I stated, without much thought:  "In particular, I don't see any of these force-ID-into-public-schools fights happening in Texas."</p>

<p>Another commenter, <a href="https://thoughtpimp.blogspot.com">Paul W.</a>, then reminded me of the textbook wars&#151;the decades-long struggle by conservative religious forces here to shape the content of the books being used for teaching youngsters in public schools.  These people are trying to do far more to twist the minds of the children of this state than just confuse them about the relative scientific validity of ID and evolution.</p>

<p>For example, back in 1996, according to a timeline from the <a href="http://www.tfn.org/publiceducation/textbooks/timeline/index.php">Texas Freedom Network</a>:<blockquote><em>Censors attempt to delete certain photographs in new textbooks, saying publishers went “overboard” in their inclusion of minorities. They also claim the textbooks overemphasize the cruelty experienced by slaves, demand that the age of Earth to be determined by biblical genealogy rather than fossil evidence and attempt to eliminate discussions of endangered animals and environmental issues.</em></blockquote>Fortunately, while the activist religious conservatives have had some successess, such as getting publishers in 2002 to "remove passages in social studies textbooks that have positive references to Islam and that note any negative characteristics of capitalism," they have apparently failed so far in their attempts to interfere with the teaching of evolution in science classes.</p>

<p>The most recent failure came a little over two years ago, and here is described in a <a href="http://www.texscience.org/files/discovery/index.htm">press release</a> of that era from <a href="http://www.texscience.org/index.php">Texas Citizens for Science</a>.<blockquote><em>On November 6, 2003, the Texas State Board of Education voted 11-4 to adopt all the biology books on the conforming list subject only to normal error correction by the Texas Education Agency staff. On November 7, all the books were adopted unanimously by voice vote with no dissent. I am happy to report that the biology texts were not censored, weakened, or modified in any way that would reduce their scientific accuracy, especially about the topics of evolution and the origin of life. Four anti-evolutionists on the Board, led by Dr. Don McLeroy, did attempt to adopt only two biology books on the conforming list and adopt the others on the nonconforming list, thereby reducing their sales, but they failed in this attempt.</em></blockquote>I somehow missed all this at the time, perhaps distracted by the upcoming Democratic primary for the Presidential election, but it is great news in retrospect.  And the textbook publishers' resistance to the followup attempts at behind-the-scenes initimidation by McLeroy and other anti-evolutionists is also great news.  Many thanks are due to organizations such as the <a href="http://www.tfn.org/">Texas Freedom Network</a> that helped in this achievement.</p>

<p>Of course, the story does not end there.  The activist religious conservative minority on the elected State Board of Education is still trying to increase the Board's power over textbook content&#151;power that was greatly restricted by the state legislature back in 1995.  The <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/APStories/stories/D8FFOF800.html">Dallas Morning-News</a> reported on January 31:<blockquote><em>Texas Board of Education members aligned with social conservatives have asked the state attorney general to strike down restrictions on their power to review and reject the content of public school textbooks. </p>

<p>The request was initiated by Republican Terri Leo of Spring, one of five board members aligned with social conservatives and a major critic of the 1996 legal opinion that has limited board control over textbook content. </p>

<p>Leo requested the opinion with the approval of board chairwoman Geraldine Miller. </p>

<p>The ruling from Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott will be closely watched because of Texas' influence in the textbook industry. Many books are tailored to the state's wishes and then marketed in other states. </p>

<p>Battles over content could touch on the teaching of evolution, what students are told about birth control and sexual abstinence, and interpretations of history. </p>

<p>Leo's request for a new opinion argued that the original one issued by former Attorney General Dan Morales was "erroneous on its face" and should be reversed, restoring full board authority over textbook selection. </p>

<p>The letter did not mention that the Legislature has repeatedly rejected bills over the past decade that would have given the board more control to screening and reject textbooks it might deem inappropriate for students. </p>

<p>Former state Sen. Bill Ratliff, who wrote the 1995 law that stripped the board of many of its powers and turned them over to local school boards, said he was "very clear" about his intention to include authority for textbook selection. </p>

<p>Ratliff, a Republican who later served as lieutenant governor, told The Dallas Morning News that Morales' opinion correctly interpreted the law. </p>

<p>"Nothing has changed," Ratliff said. "I am still sure that was the intent of the legislation."</em></blockquote>This would appear to be a quixotic quest.  Or do the social conservatives have a reason to think that GOP Attorney General Greg Abbott will rule differently on this apparently clear-cut matter of law than the conservative Democrat Dan Morales did ten years ago?</p>

<p>For even more on the current situation, and the background details, see this recent <a href="http://www.wacotrib.com/opin/content/shared/news/nation/stories/2006/02/YOUNG_COLUMN_0203_COX.html">editorial</a> by John Young of the Waco Tribune-Herald.</p>

<p>This is all a reminder to me that just because I don't see a battle going on doesn't mean it isn't there.  </p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/04/science/04climate.html?_r=1&ei=5094&en=6a15af4274e8942d&hp=&ex=1139029200&oref=slogin&partner=homepage&pagewanted=all">New York Times</a> has discovered that a 24-year old, intelligent-design-promoting press officer appointed by the White House has been interfering in the way that NASA presents its science results to the public, including insisting on controlling the public statements of renowned climate scientist James Hansen.<blockquote><em>The Big Bang memo came from Mr. [George] Deutsch, a 24-year-old presidential appointee in the press office at NASA headquarters whose résumé says he was an intern in the "war room" of the 2004 Bush-Cheney re-election campaign. A 2003 journalism graduate of Texas A&M, he was also the public-affairs officer who sought more control over Dr. Hansen's public statements. </p>

<p>In October 2005, Mr. Deutsch sent an e-mail message to Flint Wild, a NASA contractor working on a set of Web presentations about Einstein for middle-school students. The message said the word "theory" needed to be added after every mention of the Big Bang. </p>

<p>The Big Bang is "not proven fact; it is opinion," Mr. Deutsch wrote, adding, "It is not NASA's place, nor should it be to make a declaration such as this about the existence of the universe that discounts intelligent design by a creator." </p>

<p>It continued: "This is more than a science issue, it is a religious issue. And I would hate to think that young people would only be getting one-half of this debate from NASA. That would mean we had failed to properly educate the very people who rely on us for factual information the most."</p>

<p>The memo also noted that The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual specified the phrasing "Big Bang theory." Mr. Acosta, Mr. Deutsch's boss, said in an interview yesterday that for that reason, it should be used in all NASA documents. </p>

<p>The Deutsch memo was provided by an official at NASA headquarters who said he was upset with the effort to justify changes to descriptions of science by referring to politically charged issues like intelligent design. Senior NASA officials did not dispute the message's authenticity.</p>

<p>Mr. Wild declined to be interviewed; Mr. Deutsch did not respond to e-mail or phone messages. On Friday evening, repeated queries were made to the White House about how a young presidential appointee with no science background came to be supervising Web presentations on cosmology and interview requests to senior NASA scientists. </p>

<p>The only response came from Donald Tighe of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. "Science is respected and protected and highly valued by the administration," he said.</em></blockquote>The background on how the Times came to discover these latest abuses of science and scientists by the Bush administration:  </p>

<p>Last week, the Times reported of Dr. Hansen:<blockquote><em>[H]e was threatened with "dire consequences" if he continued to call for prompt action to limit emissions of heat-trapping gases linked to global warming. He and intermediaries in the agency's 350-member public-affairs staff said the warnings came from White House appointees in NASA headquarters.</p>

<p>Other National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists and public-affairs employees came forward this week to say that beyond Dr. Hansen's case, there were several other instances in which political appointees had sought to control the flow of scientific information from the agency. </p>

<p>They called or e-mailed The Times and sent documents showing that news releases were delayed or altered to mesh with Bush administration policies.</em></blockquote>The revelations are so embarrassing that the administrator, Mike Griffin, didn't waste any time promising changes:<blockquote><em>On Thursday night and Friday, The Times sent some of the documents to Dr. Griffin and senior public-affairs officials requesting a response. </p>

<p>While Dr. Griffin did not respond directly, he issued the "statement of scientific openness" to agency employees, saying, "NASA has always been, is and will continue to be committed to open scientific and technical inquiry and dialogue with the public."</p>

<p>Because NASA encompasses a nationwide network of research centers on everything from cosmology to climate, Dr. Griffin said, some central coordination was necessary. But he added that changes in the public-affairs office's procedures "can and will be made," and that a revised policy would "be disseminated throughout the agency."</em></blockquote>Let's hope Griffin's new policy is true to his words and not undermined by his own bosses in the White House.</p>

<p>Keith Cowing at <a href="http://www.nasawatch.com/archives/2006/02/george_deutsch.html">NASA Watch</a> suggests Griffin should fire George Deutsch.  That's certainly a minimum.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>Science policy journalist and author of the best-selling book, <a href="http://www.waronscience.com/home.php">The Republican War on Science</a>, Chris Mooney had some <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2006/01/santorum_cant_run_away_from_id.php">suggestions</a> for scientists late last week:<blockquote><em>I have long thought that, if science supporters want a political scalp, [Pennsylvania Republican Senator Rick] Santorum ought to be on their top list of targets. He's a strong sympathizer with anti-evolutionists, and thus on the wrong side of what is easily the most clear-cut political science issue of the day. Moreover, he's politically vulnerable. If Santorum goes down and scientists in Pennsylvania have rallied against him (something I've seen no evidence of as yet), presumably they can then claim some of the credit. And that, in turn, might deter future politicians from supporting anti-science causes. </p>

<p>Of course, if Santorum is dead anyway politically, it may not count as much of a victory. But the experience might nevertheless teach scientists a thing or two about engaging in politics in defense of scientific integrity and, especially, the theory of evolution. When it comes to politics, scientists really are in need of basic training.</em></blockquote>Mooney is advocating that, not just science supporters, but scientists themselves organize to get involved in the grind of personal, partisan politics&#151;targeting individual candidates for defeat in attempts to claim their "political scalp."  I think this would be an extremely counter-productive activity that, contrary to Mooney's goal, would almost certainly destroy the strong and respected position that scientists and science currently have in the United States.</p>

<p>In surveys, science consistently shows up as one of the most respected professions.  Even from this exalted position, scientists still have an extremely hard time teaching the public and policy makers anything beyond the mere basics of scientific knowledge, and sometimes haven't even been successful at that.   </p>

<p>On the other hand, politics consistently shows up as one of the least respected professions.  A substantial fraction of the people in this country, probably the vast majority, do not trust a thing politicians and their ardent supporters say.  </p>

<p>If scientists were to participate en masse in the personal details of partisan politics, rather than elevating the respectability of politics by doing so, it is far more likely that scientists' credibility to the public at large would be irreparably damaged.  Scientific results would be dismissed out-of-hand by huge groups of people merely based on whoever the authors, or the authors' political organization, had supported in previous campaigns.  Few things are as capable of shutting off people's logic circuits as political accusations.</p>

<p>Furthermore, given the dominant role government money plays in research funding, explicit politicization of large groups of scientists would likely turn scientific research into just another patronage program, with elected officials doling out money to scientists who then support their campaigns.</p>

<p>Scientists should continue to speak out about important policy and educational issues for which their knowledge is crucial to informing the debate.  In fact, they should increase how much they do so.  And they should work harder at educating the general public about the scientific process as well as specific scientific knowledge.  But I believe they are being far-sighted by staying away from publicly choosing and supporting their favorite candidates&#151;and thereby frittering away their hard-earned social capital for short-term political gains.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The anti-evolution forces that are attempting to insert the teaching of "Intelligent Design" into public school science classes suffered a resounding <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002695489_evolution21.html">defeat</a> two days ago, as has been widely reported.</p>

<p>No doubt, there will be plenty of further action on this front in the future, as much of the public remains unconvinced of the scientific robustness of evolutionary theory.  And so, as biologist <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/back_to_reality_the_morning_after_the_kitzmiller_decision/">P.Z. Myers</a> of Pharyngula points out, scientists need to improve at presenting their case to the public.  But, despite the media hype in recent months, the evidence is very thin that the anti-evolution forces are anywhere close to overturning our society's collective judgement that <em>real</em> science, not religious pseudo-science, belongs in public school science classes.  </p>

<p>After all, last month, in the small, conservative, semi-rural town of Dover, Pennsylvania, voters narrowly, but decisively, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion/july-dec05/dover_11-25.html">rejected</a> virtually every member of the ID-supporting school board.</p>

<p>And now a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/18/national/18judge.html">federal judge</a> appointed by none other than George W. Bush has given the ID movement a very public smackdown.</p>

<p>Those are the signs, not of a vigorous movement, but of a floundering one.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>A few weeks ago, I discovered Jeff Foust's informative "<a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/">Space Politics</a>" blog, and have been reading it ever since, in trying to keep abreast of all the changes going on at NASA these days.  So I was pleasantly surprised to see that he commented on my <a href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/08/opinion/op-ed/9oped09bryant.txt">op-ed</a> in the Washington Examiner today, as well as the other piece mine was paired with, by <a href="http://www.dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/08/opinion/op-ed/8oped09schulze.txt">Charles Schultze</a>, a senior fellow emeritus at the Brookings Institute.  Foust had some mild <a href="http://www.spacepolitics.com/archives/000560.html">criticism</a> for both of us.<blockquote><em>While both make some good points, particularly about concerns that science programs at NASA are getting squeezed in the short term (something House appropriators agree with to some degree, having added $40 million for them in the FY06 budget), I am personally disappointed with the logic of both essays. Both try to establish a dichotomy: in one [Schultze's], you can either save money to restore Medicare and Social Security, or you can fling people across the solar system; in the other [mine], you can either study the Earth to save us from natural disasters, or you can fling people across the solar system. Both, I think, are false dichotomies: Medicare and Social Security require fundamental structural changes that cannot be solved even if you disbanded NASA (good robotic science missions and all) and dispersed its budget to those programs. Climate change and other earth sciences studies are serious issues that require roles for multiple government actors, not just NASA. Rather than constructing simplistic either-or decision sets, let's see if there's a way to do both—and take advantage of what benefits of exploration we can reap in the process.</em></blockquote>I agree that, in principle, choosing between studying Earth and flying people to the Moon and Mars is a false dichotomy.  But in the real world of NASA today, it is a very real dichotomy.  NASA has one pot of money.  Bush and Congress have not given NASA any significant amount of extra funding, while saddling the space agency with the huge new mandate of sending astronauts back to the Moon in the next ten years.</p>

<p>The result is clear.  NASA is siphoning money off of its tremendously productive science programs&#151aeronautics research, space science, and Earth science are all getting big hits.  And by my article, I hope to issue a reminder that, despite their low public profile, NASA's Earth science missions are extremely important to all of us who live on this planet.  They should not be sacrificed for a goal with many fewer benefits to society.  </p>

<p>If the public clamor is loud enough, perhaps Congress will provide NASA with extra funds&#151in order to satisfy my so-called "Vision for Understanding Earth" while also still satisfying Bush's "Vision for Space Exploration."  Alternatively, if necessary (and it probably is, given Bush's huge budget deficits), Congress could override the President's priorities and fully fund NASA's Earth science programs at the expense of the manned space program.  Or at least fund it well enough to keep it alive for the long-term.</p>

<p>If so, returning to the Moon may have to wait a while longer.  Given the urgency of dealing with the changing life support systems of our planet, I think the wait will be very worthwhile.</p>

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The <a href="http://dcexaminer.com/">Washington Examiner</a> has published an op-ed, entitled &quot;<a href="http://dcexaminer.com/articles/2005/06/09//opinion/op-ed/9oped09bryant.txt">A Vision for understanding Earth</a>&quot;, about the endangered NASA Earth science program by a fellow who is probably familiar to the handful of readers of this blog.&nbsp; At least I certainly hope so, since that fellow is actually the author of this blog.&nbsp; This is my first published op-ed, and I owe thanks to Sean-Paul Kelley of <a href="http://agonist.org/">The Agonist</a> for helping make this possible, and also for sending me the link late last night when it showed up online.&nbsp; (And also for linking to the op-ed from his <a href="http://agonist.org/story/2005/6/8/194637/8075">blog</a>, as well.)</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/politics/08nasa.html">New York Times</a> has an article on the same subject today.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.agu.org/">American Geophysical Union</a>, a group representing thousands of scientists, has issued a warning about the <a href="../../../2005/05/nasas_earthobse.html">precarious state</a> of NASA Earth science.&nbsp; From the Times article:</p><blockquote><p><em>The president of the group, Dr. John A. Orcutt of the Scripps
Institute of Oceanography in San Diego, told a news conference that
NASA was being asked to do too much with the money it was given. </em></p>

<p><em>Cutting
back on Earth science, Dr. Orcutt said, endangers significant progress
that has been made in understanding the environment over the last few
decades and hampers innovative research.</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;Missions being
eliminated or subject to long delays include inexpensive Explorer-class
satellites for space science and Pathfinder missions for Earth science,
which are innovative next steps in what we need to study,&quot; he said
later. &quot;When you look to the future, there's not much in the pipeline
to replace many of the satellites operating now when they reach the end
of their lives.&quot;</em></p>

<p><em>In testimony before Congress, NASA officials had
acknowledged the drop in science budgets, but said it was a temporary
situation that would be corrected.</em></p>

<p><em>Dr. Eric J. Barron of
Pennsylvania State University, a member of the committee that drafted
the statement, said a pause was significant because it left little to
encourage young scientists and engineers to go into Earth and space
science and threatened to create a gap in future knowledge. </em></p>

<p><em>&quot;You need to have a lot of faith in it being 'temporary,' &quot; Dr. Barron said.</em></p></blockquote><p>Since Bush's budget deficits and far from temporary and the new Moon/Mars &quot;<a href="../../../2005/05/bushs_nasa.html">Vision for Space Exploration</a>&quot; is also far from temporary, I see no reason to believe the NASA officials who claim this is merely a temporary bump in the road.&nbsp; If so, it will only be because enough of us raise a big enough stink that Congress decides to reverse NASA's and Bush's extremely shortsighted decision-making.</p>

<p>Despite Bush's shifting of priorities away from learning about our own planet, President Bush still had the nerve to say <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/e80e1fbc-d7bb-11d9-9f43-00000e2511c8.html">yesterday</a> that &quot;We need to know more about [global warming].&nbsp; It's a lot easier to solve when you know more about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Contrary to his words, Bush' policies are making sure that we will not know enough about global warming to solve it until it is too late.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>The New York Times published an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/07/opinion/07behe.html">op-ed</a> from perhaps the most prominent proponent of the &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; theory, Michael Behe.&nbsp; Unfortunately, but predictably, it turns out to be a very misleading, if not outright deceptive, as biologist PZ Myers points out at <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/behe_jumps_the_shark/">Pharyngula</a>.</p>

<p>I read Behe's article before I read Myers' response, and I, too, found it sneakily deceptive, despite coming at it from my layman's perspective.&nbsp; But Behe's style may be sufficient to confuse and mislead many people who are not familiar with the evolution versus intelligent design debate.</p>

<p>PZ Myers' response should therefore be as widely read as Behe's article, and I hope the Times sees fit to print a full-length op-ed piece—not just a letter-to-the-editor—from a biologist such as Myers in the coming days.</p>

<p>Myers initially points out Behe's empty promise:</p><blockquote><p><em> [Behe] </em><em>claims the Intelligent Design guess is based on physical
evidence, and that he has four lines of argument; you’d expect him to
then succinctly list the evidence, as was done in the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/">29+ Evidences for Macroevolution</a> FAQ on the <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/">talkorigins site</a>. He doesn’t. Not once in the entire op-ed does he give a single piece of this “physical evidence.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Later, Myers reveals one of the major deceptions in Behe's piece.&nbsp; Information that the typical reader, including myself, will not have:</p><blockquote><p><em>The rest of his argument consists of citing a number of instances of
biologists using the word “machine” to refer to the workings of a cell.
This is ludicrous; he’s playing a game with words, assuming that
everyone will automatically link the word “machine” to “design.” But of
course, Crick and Alberts and the other scientists who compared the
mechanism of the cell to an intricate machine were making no
presumption of design.</em></p>

<p><em>There is another sneaky bit of dishonesty here; Behe is trying to
use the good names of Crick and Alberts to endorse his crackpot theory,
when the creationists know full well that <a href="http://www.designinference.com/documents/02.02.POISK_article.htm">Crick did not believe in ID</a>, and that <a href="http://www.cellbioed.org/articles/vol3no2/article.cfm?articleID=98">Alberts has been vocal in his opposition</a>.</em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>Later, Myers writes:</p><blockquote><p><em>Look at what he is doing: he is simply declaring that there is no
convincing explanation in biology that doesn’t require intelligent
design, therefore Intelligent Design creationism is true. But thousands
of biologists think the large body of evidence in the scientific
literature </em>is<em> convincing! Behe doesn’t get to just wave his
hands and have all the evidence for evolutionary biology magically
disappear; he is trusting that his audience, lacking any knowledge of
biology, will simply believe him</em>.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, he concludes by boiling down Behe's essay into its essential form:</p><blockquote><p><em>Behe began this op-ed by telling us that he was going to give us the
contemporary argument for Intelligent Design creationism, consisting of
four linked claims. Here’s a shorter Behe for you:</em></p>

<p><em><strong>The evidence for Intelligent Design.</strong></em></p>

<ol><li><em>It’s obvious.</em></li>

<li><em>It’s obvious!</em></li>

<li><em>Evolutionary explanations are no good.</em></li>

<li><em>There aren’t any good evolutionary explanations.</em></li></ol>

<p><em>That’s it.</em></p>

<p><em>That’s pathetic.</em></p>

<p><em>And it’s in the New York Times? Journalism has fallen on very hard times.</em></p></blockquote><p>Let's see if the Times comes through by giving space to a proper couter-argument in the next few days.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

                        <div class="entry-body">
                                <p>From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/26/science/26climate.html" title="The New York Times &gt; Science &gt; The Environment: NASA Expert Criticizes Bush on Global Warming Policy">New York Times</a> today:</p>

<p><em></em></p><blockquote><p><em>A top NASA climate expert who twice briefed Vice President Dick Cheney on global warming plans to criticize the administration's approach to the issue in a lecture at the University of Iowa tonight and say that a senior administration official told him last year not to discuss dangerous consequences of rising temperatures.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><em>The expert, Dr. James E. Hansen, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan, expects to say that the Bush administration has ignored growing evidence that sea levels could rise significantly unless prompt action is taken to reduce heat-trapping emissions from smokestacks and tailpipes.</em></p>

<p><em>Many academic scientists, including dozens of Nobel laureates, have been criticizing the administration over its handling of climate change and other complex scientific issues. But Dr. Hansen, first in an interview with The New York Times a week ago and again in his planned lecture today, is the only leading scientist to speak out so publicly while still in the employ of the government.</em></p>

<p><em>...</em></p>

<p><em>Dr. Hansen, 63, acknowledged that he imperiled his credibility and perhaps his job by criticizing Mr. Bush's policies in the final days of a tight presidential campaign. He said he decided to speak out after months of deliberation because he was convinced the country needed to change course on climate policy.</em></p>

<p><em>Dr. Hansen rose to prominence when, after testifying at a Senate hearing in the record-warm summer of 1988, he said, &quot;It is time to stop waffling so much and say the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here.&quot;</em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The degree to which prominent scientists such as Hansen are getting involved in politics this year is unprecedented in my memory.&nbsp; And for good reason, given the Bush administration's virtual total disregard for the scientific process.</p>

<p>Mr. Hansen's decision is probably too late to play a significant role in this campaign, especially since conservatives will, unfortunately, find it easy to dismiss him as a partisan, given the $250,000 award he received from the Heinz Foundation in 2001 (mentioned in the New York Times article).&nbsp; Nonetheless, I am always encouraged to hear scientists speak up about what has been going on.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the White House's &quot;science adviser&quot;, in this article, reveals yet again that, despite his apparent earlier background as a respected scientist, he has become a complete patsy for his bosses:</p>

<p><em></em></p><blockquote><p><em>Dr. John H. Marburger III, the science adviser to the president, said he was not privy to any exchanges between Dr. Hansen and the administrator of NASA. But he denied that the White House was playing down the risks posed by climate change.</em></p>

<p></p>

<p><em>&quot;President Bush has long recognized the serious implications of climate change, the role of human activity, and our responsibility to reduce emissions,'' Dr. Marburger said in an e-mailed statement. &quot;He has put forward a series of policy initiatives including a commitment to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of our economy.''</em></p></blockquote><p></p>

<p>The whole idea of &quot;greenhouse gas intensity&quot; is meaningless in the context of fighting global warming.&nbsp; It is a phrase coined by the White House a few years ago to make it appear as if their policies are reducing something important, when in fact they are not.</p>

<p>&quot;Greenhouse gas intensity&quot; is supposed to be the amount of greenhouse gases emitted per GDP value of our economy.&nbsp; This number has been gradually decreasing since long before Bush took office, even as total greenhouse gas emissions (the actual problem!)&nbsp; have significantly increased.&nbsp; Bush's policies do nothing to cut total greenhouse gas emissions and only serve to perpetuate the status quo.&nbsp; Pretending that this status quo reduction in &quot;greenhouse gas intensity&quot; does anything to combat global warming is scientific malpractice, in my mind, and Marburger should be ashamed to participate in this deception.</p>
